The training data contains 6,112 posts, already labeled with one of the above categories. 
The test data contains 4,076 posts that are unlabeled. The submission should be a .csv (comma separated free text) 
file with a header line ”Id, Category” followed by exactly 4,076 lines. In each line, there should be exactly two 
integers, separated by a comma. The first integer is the line ID of a test question (0 - 4,075), and the second 
integer is the category your classifier predicts one of (0,1).
