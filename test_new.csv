0,"Then you shouldn't have any problem backing up your claims with some invoices, requests and approval and any Constitutional evidence that you are correct. The fact is, as stated by CNN, Fox and other media is that 14 SCHOOL BUSES were used for transportation. I suppose that would make the school liable if anyone was injured also? Seems like you are the one with baseless claims? There isn't anything LIKELY but your desire to support thugs."
1,"no they are not. you quote a web site that is not dawkin's interpretations of biomorphs and suggest that the web site's interpretation is what dawkins created biomorphs for. it is outlines very clearly in ""the blind watchmaker"" as to what limitations should be put on the biomorphs when comparing them to real life. again i say to reclaim integrity admit that dawkins never suggested that biomorphs should be considered as a model for evolution or natural selection, and there was only one main point to be taken from them (small mutations are more likely to produce benefits than large mutations)."
2,"So do 25,000 year old cave paintings."
3,"Why not? My mother has been 39,for the last 39 years."
4,"Botched abortions are one of the causes of death, but the primary causes of death are bleeding, infection, high blood pressure and prolonged labor.And, if abortion were safe and legal and offered as an option during the early term of a pregnancy, particularly in the case of young girls, that cause of death would be dramatically reduced."
5,So could heterosexual marriage.
6,"They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?"
7,"No, they just don't 'fear' in general, their fears are directed at something (madmen with guns ), and those that do find other ways to feel protected (usually in society rather than being a lone individual)."
8,Oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic...not to mention that no ice cores support such magical ideas.
9,California's ban on same sex marriage is still valid as long as the ruling is being appealed. Don't get your hopes up about the Supreme Court's conservative five judge majority to agree with the decision of the lower court.
10,Why is that propoganda? It's exactly what you do.
11,"Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup. Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety. The reason that life must be derived from life (biogenesis) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen. ""You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth"" as Newton said. Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life. This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.One more thing, evolution is a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis is rare and fragmentary just as it is for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model. "
12,The frequency of legitimate ones doesn't warrant my walking around armed all the time IMO. How does my being unarmed put you at risk? Think I should be prepared to shoot someone for you in case of emergency? Touchee yourself.
13,"You don't need an FFL to transfer an out of state  antique  firearm. I believe it is also OK for a minor to purchase and own an antique firearm. In addition, I believe the NFA doesn't apply to antique firearms. (Am I correct on that last one?)  So, zachvac can mail order a double barreled shotgun, saw the barrels short, and attach a pistol grip, legally."
14,Yes. Only the ignorant think not.
15,"Now that's just scary, I must say."
16,"I think the real question is not detaching but killing. You don't detach a fetus during an abortion..you just kill the fetus (or embryo) and suck it out. I am not sure Tom is for any of that.But if Tom would die, then no...Bob has no right to detach...in fact, probably no right even if he wouldn't die."
17,Not afraid of anything... I want them and buy them because I CAN. They all have different uses and history I collect some of them for that reason.
18,"Less than a playstation, of course!"
19,"We know that now, but not because the sun rises every day, because we have identified other evidence that proves heliocentrism.The hypothesis ""the sun orbits the earth"" predicts it will rise and set every day, the hypothesis ""The earth is rotating"" predicts the same."
20,"so people you dont know deserve to die? The point is that they are people. You are a person that is not well known. If you died, and someone that didn't know you saw your story on the news, they might not care, but you still matter don't you."
21,"I'm not sure what you mean by either genetic determinism or neo-darwinism, but there is no contradiction between multi-purpose genes and evolution by natural selection, or the principle that genotypic alterations have a phenotypic expression. Just because a gene may have more than one function, or multiple genes make contribute to a single characteristic, doesn't make any substantive difference to the theory of evolution, which you should recall was inititally developed before there was any understanding of genetics at all."
22,"Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird."
23,"Ho, hum... humanist, atheistic babble that does nothing but keep you running in circles, thinking you are actually getting somewhere."
24,"I don't see a huge difference. The same methodology science used to come up with sonograms and amniocentesis was used to come up with evolution. After all, both sonic imaging and amniocentesis are theories."
25,"Actually, that's just not true. Perhaps if you actually educated yourself about the topic. A good place to start would be Dalrymple's ""The Age of the Earth."" Maybe if you learned how and why such dating techniques work you wouldn't look so foolish."
26,"She made no such ""declaration"". I suggest you re-read what was reported, and consult a dictionary."
27,"So what? A person has a right to defend themselves, as spelled out in the Constitution.Or would you rather the 80 year old just get beaten to death for his $262?Or maybe you'd feel better if he'd suffered the same fate as the home invader over in Maryland. He made the mistake of breaking and entering into a student house and was slaughtered with a sword.And what point are you trying to make anyway? It's not like the 80 year old went on a killing spree of anything. Nobody got murdered. So what're you moaning about?"
28,"In the word's of Marilyn   We, the people of the United States, in order that we shall have the right to preserve a State free for all races, shall achieve this end by the use of non-lethal weaponry only for our continued survival as human beings. This free State entails our personal self-defense as well as our right to our food consumption. In keeping with current government law, if we so choose to possess a non-lethal weapon (be it either upon our persons or within our private homes), we are obligated to store these aforementioned weapons plus any ammo relating to its use in a manner which will serve to protect the welfare of a minor child. To further secure our persons, we have the right to wear bullet-proof body armour, plus live in bullet-proof houses as well as drive bullet-proof vehicles.   Umm... Well. I think this is enough to make anyone laugh.  Wow, I love hippies!... *LOUD COUGH, LOUD COUGH*"
29,I think you just made the point that they're people after a certain degree of development takes place.
30,"Actually, I had no intention of responding to WW. As I'm sure you can see by now, he doesn't actually respond to what's written, but rather just engages in lies and insults. He's not worth the effort to debunk; he's self-debunking."
31,"Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need."
32,"What would be the opposition to making 2nd, 3rd, and partial birth abortions illegal with exceptions involving  life and death  issues of the mother?  It seems to me that all others matters could be sorted out before the 1st trimester is complete.  If this were a viable option how many abortions would actually be prevented??"
33,"Here's their official website, Oath Keepers Oath Keepers ? Guardians of the Republic Can anyone point out any real and present danger they represent as a radical or dangerous group which appears to be a threat to the American Way from any of their literature at all? In fact, doesn't it concern you greatly that organizations in America today would be so far LEFT that they would consider what this organization represents to be any type of threat at all?  Can the thread starter support his perceived concern from anything their web site actually says?"
34,But if you had read carefully the information that I provided you would realize:  The people that already own weapons don't seem to be doing much to combat crime and are probably doing more to cause the problem than to solve it. So throwing more guns at the problem doesn't seem to make much sense.
35,"actually, the only valid question plotter asked is about the existence of dinosaurs (How did they fit into the creation schedule?) Good question plotter...Plotter: ""when did he create all the other planets, when did he create all the other stars and comets?""Gen. 1:14 And God said, ""Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth."" And it was so. and XQ, what stories are you talking about?"
36,Oh get over yourself and your self delusional narrow fundamentalist mentality.... I thought monogamy was a positive thing was it not?  Oh that's right it doesn't matter about two people loving one another. Two consensual adults being able to express their love in a private ceremony and having that love protected under the law....
37,"There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;The word ""evolution"" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. It's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. The U.S. government is no longer small. "
38,"Just like Rosie O'Donnel, or Josh Sugarmann, or Sarah Brady."
39,"Er, no. That is AnswersinGenesis' reasoning. Are you having difficulties reading? It seems so, as you are unable to distinguish between what a poster says and what an organization they are quoting says."
40,"Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?"
41,"Wow, I hope I'm not the only person who went directly to your source to check it out. Lets review several points here:1)The need to display current information. This article is almost four years old, I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush's presidency. George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history, few will argue this whether they support him or not. Just about every negative thing Bush has been involved in or people speculate he was involved in has been dragged out and there any number of books with the details. This info has had little or no further data in the past 4 years. The press loves a scandal and I have yet to see them shy away from one as juicy as this if it were true.2)The need to display information from a reputable source. Just to clarify Flynt is Larry Flynt since you seemed to leave this detail out. This transcript comes from a bulletin board and the sources it cites are at places like gwbushnotmypresident.com and atheist.org I'm sure neither of these websites has an agenda. The end of the post displays an anti-Republican manifesto showing that the person who posted it did it with such impartiality. I'm sure they are focusing on being fair and balanced.3)Make sure the parts of your source that you don't quote don't contain info that harms your argument. Larry Flynt bases nearly all of this theory on the alleged event of Bush visiting the girl in the hospital after she had an abortion. If this ever did occur there is no evidence that Bush knew that she had an abortion. Flynt says so himself:"
42,"No one saw a man's track for 100 million years. You told me that you had read the material at the links. Did you lie or is it that you didn't understand any of it? Some of the best ""man tracks"" were found by removing the soil on top of the slab. Some of the tracks were only the shallow impression of the middle part of the tridactyl print. Mr. Carl Baugh claimed these were human tracks. He convinced John Morris of the ICR. After these tracks had been exposed for about 10 years, Glen Kuban invited John Morris back to look again. In some of those tracks the softer infill has since eroded to show clearly the tridactyl nature of the tracks. In others, the infill has changed color by being exposed to the river water. The outline of the entire track is vivible in the stone. John Morris now agrees that there is no track in the river that was made by a human.I am amazed that you went to visit this river and didn't go inside the Park Headquarters. They have a very nice display that explains the history. Also there are signs at various points of access to the river with signs with information. How is it that you paid attention to none of it.But you said in your original post, ""The heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances, the toes."" That just isn't true. You didn't see that in the river. Maybe you stopped at Mr. Carl Baugh's ""Creation Evidence Museum"" and saw his carved footprint and his cast of a Pleurocoelus print in which he imagines he sees a human track. He gives a lovely ad hoc explanation about how the person slipped and the toes are turned under.I think that maybe you forgot your hat on the day you went to Glen Rose. It's hot in Texas and you were having delusions if you saw what you claim in the river."
43,"The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes. I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them.Cybererratus is a very interesting persona. He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling."
44,"Oh good grief newbies are all the same on this forum...  Honestly, how many times do you think I've heard the Exodus and Numbers quote on this forum given my post count and join date? Do a search on the Exodus one...easy to see that is wrong.  The Numbers quote has nothing to do with who or who isn't valuable to God. That's like saying counting people over the age of 40 years old means everyone below is not a person."
45,"Blah, blah. So you looked something up. Adds nothing."
46,"First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape/incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off.But of course you are missing the whole point.You are not the one being raped so it isn't YOUR choice.I don't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and isn't good for my emotional health.If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape/incest victims,for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons?"
47,Yes this is absurd.  All things are subject to the Will of God the Creator. Nothing exists or can exist that is not subject to God's Will.  God is not perfect at everything. God is not perfectly evil either.   Your analogy is flawed.  Try again.
48,"All I know is Obama and Biden both have a bad history of voting agains law abiding gun owners, if they are given a gun ban bill to sign, they will almost certainly sign it."
49,"What is so sacred about this type of ""information"" that it cannot be produced randomly?"
50,"Good pick up.Also, how do we ""know"" that the heat generated in these reactors is from so-called ""nuclear fission"" and not a heavenly gift to allow us our god-given right to toasters and ipods. The scientists had funny foreign names, so they are likely non-christian terrorists who hate freedom. Anyway, this nucular physics stuff is just another religion."
51,This is awesome.  Not only are they showing direct evidence of natural selection in action (crab resistors vs. crab avoiders) but they are witnessing speciation as a direct result.  Totally cool.
52,"No, it wasn't. Given the number of scientists one might assume that at least one would confuse his science with his religion. It seems that according to AIG, 182 actually do. I really have to commend AIG in that they did not list ""Dr."" Kent Hovind, ""Dr."" Carl Baugh, ""Dr."" Don Patton. However, the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who's highest earned degree is an MS in physics, his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate, Christian university. Clifford Burdick has a ""degree"" from a non-university (as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the ""University of Physical Sciences"", from which Burdick claimed his degree: ""'The University is not an educational institution, but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science. There are no campus, professors or tuition fee.""). Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his ""degree"" from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year. I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator.I presume that the rest of the ""scientists"" listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed.I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list, now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life. The name ""Steve"" (and variations thereof) comprises about 1% of the population. The percentage of qualified scientists with that name cannot be far from the norm. The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology, geology, paleontology, or a related scientific field. However, there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory. For example, Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list.I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list. I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts. Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees.Oh, yes. In my experience, creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists. On the other hand, there are lots of scientists who were once creationists, before they became scientists. As many polls have shown, the more educated a person becomes, the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist."
53,Sometimes a pregancy means death. Most of the time it doesn't. Are we allowed to make this distinction since you brought it up or must we treat every pregnancy as life threatening?
54,"What liberals?  http://www.republicansforchoice.com/  Last time I checked abortion wasn't a clear cut partisan issue.  By the way you implied it, you act like it is either expected or common for conservatives to be intolerant racists, homophobes or sexists.  Oh well, thanks for playing the knee-jerk, partisan card for us. It is always a crowd pleaser. Next you can tell us about how liberals have a big laser cannon on the moon that is being used to vaporize decency and morality in America and how they'll force 4 year old children into watching Brokeback Mountain at public schools from their secret base.  Those dastardly liberals!"
55,"I think even the Court knows that the Fourteenth was not well crafted, at least in terms of forsight. However, once it was ratified the Court really had no choice but to try to work it into the legal landscape.  Certainly State power needed to be curtailed to stop such institutions such as slavery, but I don't think restructuring how the entire Constitution works was the right move."
56,"The use of Pepper Spray is legal for carrying by a person 18 years of age or older""Some examples of misuse include; spraying on people in anger, as a joke, possession of by prohibited persons; minors, drug addicts or persons convicted of felonies.Don't know where you got that.I was watching a reality TV show (my DVR quit on me) about court files. A CA jury sentenced a teenage girl to 22 years of hard time for stabbing a 47 year old man when he tried to rape her. Assuming this is true (which it could not be due to the fact that its reality TV), how can the jury sleep at night? The defense proved that the man often made violent sexual advances on women, and the 17 year old girl was not inherently violent. She was convicted on second degree murder and sentenced to the maximum possible amount of time. Seriously, this is one F*cked up state. I can't even believe something like that would happen in this day and age."
57,"That is one definition of creation. There are many. You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about, and argue against that.If you want a (non-exhaustive list) seehttp://www.crystalinks.com/creation.htmlYou have simply picked one model, treated it as the only one, and constructed a (thus false) argument against it."
58,"That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb."
59,"Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists, the design argument is from the creationist side. It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley. Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality (Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ's College, Cambridge that Paley did). The argument from design is presented as ""proof"" of God or an ""intelligent"" designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism. But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore isn't ""proof"". Evolutionary biologists don't assert that there is not god, only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one.Science is naturalistic. Even if some scientists (and others) are philosophical naturalists, science doesn't work that way. It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural. It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism."
60,"I'd be willing to give it a shot. Except, you cannot bring up  right to life  but can use God all you want."
61,"I think you nailed it! I also think that if you are willing to give up your relationship over religion you could be on the border of addiction not faith. (not you personally, but rhetorically)"
62,Yes. He a complete fraud. Why?
63,"And the same people that believe that are the ones that keep saying that teaching about alternative lifestyles isn't.  BTW, Woodhaven is in my neck of the woods. Everyone here in Michigan has guns, especially the criminals."
64,"Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?"
65,"I'm not selfish, whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world.  As Another_opinion hinted, another factor is the fact that until around the end of the second trimester, I do not believe that a foetus is a person - something that made the choice to abort much easier for me than it is for some women whose religions have brainwashed them to worship the holy fertilized egg."
66,"So, are you saying your friends don't deserve to live because they have no morals? I hope you don't blame the parents for the kids lack of judgement. They really have no excuse. There are, I am sure, many good families that have raised criminals. One of the things that mark maturity is not blaming your parents for your downfalls.So are you saying that a person that is unloved in their youth would have been better off not having a shot at life? If you are please consider:My Mom and Dad had the abortion appointment set up. That's how unwanted I was. Do you think I don't have a right to life? That I was better served not being able to give life a go?My sister was divorced (for lack of a better word) from her parents, are you saying because they treated her poor she was better off not being?A lousy beginning in life does not mean that a person's whole life will be worthless or unhappy.have a nice day,heidi"
67,"Here in the Midwest, large numbers of diehard black Democrats voted for Kerry and against gay marriage. It truly was a cross-over issue that transcended party politics."
68,"No, actually, we don't.   I suppose it's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know."
69,"Actually, I reported the real results of a study. Regular church attendees are twice as likely to vote Republican...etc., the conclusion was, however, meant to be a joke. Most got it, you didn't."
70,emoticon_xbouncer yahooooooo!!!!!!!
71,Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.Does your government attempt to do this?What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?
72,So? There are other articles and books that do. Is your link the ultimate authority on the cause of crime?
73,"And I believe they should ban religious speech the defame gays or ban religion all together as a public nuisance and protect the public from its drug like effects. I understand, however, that to restrict others freedom of speech of one group today, might mean that my freedom of speech could be restricted tomorrow.They have the right to free speech even free speech, I or anyone else diagrees with. This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech. With freedom comes responsiblity. The law suit for pain and suffering, I think is just.Oh so many law suits to plan. Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity. This case now sets Precedent, that if I find religious speech hurtfull, or the actions of religious groups trying to fight gay people, marriage, or gay rights, I could sue for pain and suffering.God bless Fred Phelps for giving fundies and religion a black eye. :) Fred Phelps is the one of the best things ever that could happen for gay rights. GO FRED."
74,"You are SO insulting.   Oh, the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly.   Who are you to say they aren't thinking clearly? I'll give it to you, Bassman. You are the most polite, best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered. You nearly had me fooled."
75,"The population of the European Union is 501,259,840."
76,"Unlike California, amendments in Iowa must pass the legislature first (simple majority) before going to the voters. While I know little about the Iowa legislature, this seems a no brainer in a populace vote, considering previous votes and more current polls on this subject in Iowa. As a rule I lend polls very little credence, but DOMA passed by a wide majority in 1998. I doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap, a lot of traditional values and religious folks in Iowa."
77,"That's just not true. It is a logical fallacy. Evolutionary theory makes no claims to be able to recount every mutation, recombination, migration, random mating, or chance death of every organsim. But the evidence for evolution is beyond dispute. More than 99% of degreed biologists accept evolutionary theory as the best explanation for the observed data."
78,Well that does make sense given that one would not expect you to understand environmental pressures on mutations if you can't even understand erosion.  Would you expect someone to understand quantum physics if they could not even understand force? No. Therefore [u]it predicts that one who does not understand some of the most basic things will not understand the complex.[u]
79,"Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't ""on the grounds,"" although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that ""accommodating"" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not."
80,"Because it's all quite clear. Decades of effort from the religious right, conservative republicans, and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic. It's a tragedy, but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you, everyone knows it, and no one is going to do it. It's politics 101. The democrats, as a whole, want to do the right thing, but they know that if they say so too loudly they won't be in a position to do anything. They're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action. This is of course a generalization, but if you're talking about a political party as a whole that's unavoidable. Generally speaking dems don't trumpet gay rights because they know how many votes it'll cost them, and thus prevent them from actually working for gays rights. Reps don't trumpet gay right because they don't support gay rights. This is the common political wisdom, and if you want to show that it doesn't apply to a specific individual you need to make the case for that individual."
81,"I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal."

84,"I believe that microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed. Macroevolution, however, is replete huge gaping holes, disingenuousness and outright fraudI have provided a few links in order to prevent this post from taking the plethora of space it would require and deserves. Anyway here are just some of the problems I have with the way evolution is taught:ORIGIN OF LIFE. Why do textbooks claim that the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment shows how life's building blocks may have formed on the early Earth -- when conditions on the early Earth were probably nothing like those used in the experiment, and evolution in no way explains the origin of life?READ MOREDARWIN'S TREE OF LIFE. Why don't textbooks discuss the ""Cambrian explosion,"" in which all major animal groups appear together in the fossil record fully formed instead of branching from a common ancestor -- thus contradicting the evolutionary tree of life?READ MORE HOMOLOGY. Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry, then claim that it is evidence for common ancestry -- a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence?READ MORE VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS. Why do textbooks use drawings of similarities in vertebrate embryos as evidence for their common ancestry -- even though biologists have known for over a century that vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their early stages, and the drawings are faked?READ MOREARCHAEOPTERYX. Why do textbooks portray this fossil as the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds -- even though modern birds are probably not descended from it, and its supposed ancestors do not appear until millions of years after it?READ MORE PEPPERED MOTHS. Why do textbooks use pictures of peppered moths camouflaged on tree trunks as evidence for natural selection -- when biologists have known since the 1980s that the moths don't normally rest on tree trunks, and all the pictures have been staged?READ MORE DARWIN'S FINCHES. Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection -- even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended, and no net evolution occurred? MUTANT FRUIT FLIES. Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution -- even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants cannot survive outside the laboratory? HUMAN ORIGINS. Why are artists' drawings of ape-like humans used to justify materialistic claims that we are just animals and our existence is a mere accident -- when fossil experts cannot even agree on who our supposed ancestors were or what they looked like?READ MORE EVOLUTION A FACT? Why are we told that Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific fact -- even though many of its claims are based on misrepresentations of the facts?READ MOREThere's many more. Don't even get me started on horse toes."
85,"So, you think there is a God? Bad design does not equate to no design. It really is a poor argument.Much of the force of Darwin's arguments deal with bad design. I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of ""bad"" design. That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is ""bad design"" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more ""error"" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency. The point is ""bad"" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all. The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.Origin of Species Chapter 13:There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of ""bad design"" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars). The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the ""imperfections"" of biology are part of a larger plot.It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis."

If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does!

94,I think this is why people like Paul Helmke think that Supreme Court rulings on the constitutionality of gun control laws are win/win situations for his side.

In fact, in kanada, suicides increased with stricter gun laws...another failed experiment.YOUR hint of ""developed nations"" is misleading and by presentation you try to lure the reader into thinking that gun control only exists in ""developed nations"" as if there is a superiority in people who inhabit them.

I don't see how you can pick and choose what you care to believe out of the Bible. How can one believe in the miracle of Jesus' birth and resurrection yet not believe that Adam and Eve were real people? I find it a contradiction to somehow believe that God is great enough to create the universe, yet He somehow needed billions of years to do so. If God is all-powerful, then His words should be all that's needed. To me, the world is proof that God is all-powerful. The beauty and complexity is just staggering.

Any benefits that exist in allowing same-sex marriage aren't being weighed down by abnormality.[QUOTE]The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.[QUOTE]Well, I won't argue that we will never be truly equal, and I won't argue that equality is the answer to everything, but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice, it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there. Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution. In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights. As you went higher up in class, you'd get more and more political power. In America, we all have one vote. We all have an equal ability to participate in government. It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government, but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality. Consider even slaves or women's rights. These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice. I will admit that we cannot simply just make everyone equal in every way, but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation. In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should)."

155,??? It just happened recently in Maryland
156,Again? What do you mean? I am talking about different sciences per se. What is your question?
157,"Oh, well. Apparently you want to talk molecular chemistry whereas I was hoping to discuss organismic evolution. Too bad. Good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic, but it just doesn't interest me."
158,The NRA gave him an A rating.  Project Vote Smart - National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund Rating  He voted for the Castle Doctrine.  Soles supported wider self-defense law | newsobserver.com projects  But he's an anti-gun hypocrite.  Somebuddy splain that to me pleaze.
159,I accept your apology with appreciation. I am sorry if I jumped the gun. Perhaps I am too suspicious. I will adjust my attitude.
160,"Everything basically.You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. They decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life."
161,"But only in a good cause - which is defined as putting money into the pockets of friends of the Bush dynasty. Registering gays in DC is not going to do that. Nor will a lot of other worthy programs. On the other hand tearing down a country with one hand while rebuilding it with the other and paying for both ones own armaments and those of the ""enemy"" manages the job nicely. And after all ""the right people"" will come out ahead since they can hire all the cheap servants they want."
162,"Translation = ""I've closed my brain off and I've got not nothing."""
163,"As for myself, I have serious concerns about research done by Lott.""Lott has been unable to provide evidence to back up his claim that 98% of defensive gun uses don't involve the firing of the weapon. When questioned Lott has changed his story several times about where he got the 98% statistic from. The validity of other statistics in his book are also in question because he didn't control for such factors as poverty and drug use. David Mustard, co-author of Lott's study, admitted under oath in Klein v. Mustard that the study left out certain variables which are relevant to the crime rate. Gary Kleck, a pro-gun advocate and researcher, commented on this '[More]likely, the declines in crime, coinciding with relaxation of carry laws were largely attributable to other factors not controlled for in the Lott and Mustard analysis'(Targeting Guns; p. 372).While the case against Lott may not be as strong as the case against Bellesiles, enough questions have been raised about Lott's book that it would be wise to refrain from relying too much on his research.""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg...stomer-reviews"
164,Well it doesn't go against the US constitution...Does it go against the California constitution? I haven't seen much credible evidence for this..then again I don't know much about the California constitution. Do you?  What do you care? You always admit you find pleasure in seeing conservatives suffer.
165,"Well, i guess that depends on your definition of intellectual. Rational judgement would put one down the path of pro-life, however, I must say there are plenty of people above me that I would call an intellectual before I call myself that. Justice Scalia comes to mind. And likewise, I wouldn't accuse you of being in the  intellectual  coloumn either."
166,Government employees are also expected to be fingerprinted but I don't think any reasonable person would think that is treating them like criminals. In the early period of America most gun owners were required to be government employees by law- they were required to enroll in the militia and received pay for doing so.
167,"Last month, the Justice Department reported that the FBI had kept thousands of names on its watch list based on outdated information and should have removed them.  In other words with out due process of any kind nor a resort to clear your name, people are on a list. A terrorist list often with out knowledge of how they got there. Or even if they are on there. Yet we the people are supposed to trust  big brother  to be honest. Now lautenberg and the rest of jackals are rushing to ensure you will lose any rights you may have had prior to being placed on this list."
168,"It comes down to two groups  1 religious groups that believe that their religious freedom is more important then gay peoples religious freedom, that their religious freedom is more important then the safety and protection of gay families. That their religious beliefs and freedom is more important then gay equality and civil rights.  2 Heteros that believe that gay people are sick, diseased, less then human, and that their family structure is the only one that should exist.  In both cases groups that have a sense that they are privleged and their privlege is more important then the rights and lives of gay people."

170,"So tell me....knowing that the human race is 99.9% the same, and that  No matter how scientists today scrutinize a person's genes, they can't determine with certainty whether an individual is from one  racial  group or another ....how can you justify how the racist scientists can hold up a skull and make judgements about it? How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes? How can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different  species  based not on their genes -- which are 99.9% similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull? Evolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing, monkey-loving, chance-worshipping, racist fools."
171,Not hardly. Show where they initiated it. Your first link showed it to be a reaction to the initiation done by evolutionists.
172,"So we can't base our definition of ""kind"" on mere appearances?I mean if we are going to put things into categories and call the category ""kind"", we should do this by common appearances. A penguin is in the same kind as a hummingbird, but is a lobster in the same kind as an oyster? Obviously a lobster and a shrimp would be in the same kind, but could a dolphin and a manatee be in the same kind? Did they evolve from a common ancestor kind?And since apes look and act so much like humans, didn't they just evolve from humans? By all appearances, they we must all be in the same kind."
173,"You know the answer, Matt. They'd never accept it."
174,"I think the answer to that is much like J.P. Morgan's famous retort when someone asked him how much his yacht cost. 'If you have to ask, you can't afford it'. I'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons couldn't afford them, but if the interest isn't already there, it's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question."
175,This seems beside the point. Simply put Close_slave_can stated in his challenge (post #1)
176,"The existence of a soul is a bit tough to test in a lab but is you pour clorox on a virus it stops moving and spreading, and evolving does it not? Of course killing it's host and burning the body would also be a good empirical test .  However if one has no soul then murder is just rearranging matter .  Why would that matter?"
177,"would that be legaly owned guns, or criminals who have guns (and also ues guns) for there crimes? most Gang members have guns, if they are killed in a drive by shooting, is the gun responsable, or would it be the illegal activitys?"
178,"Here is how the exchange went down. Person one. We need to teach morals to our students. Person two. Well if you do that, who's morals will you teach? I may disagree.  No one could answer that question so they taught no morals.  I think we should start by agreeing that things like, but not exclusively, murder, stealing, and hate is wrong. Teach that in which we can agree!"
179,"Yes, I'd say I do exist (to answer your question). Furthermore, I don't see why Matthew S has a problem with it....he is the one thinking we are ""at war"" and he states that he is willing to do the same things. I assume he finds this behavior during ""a war"" to be fairly standard and if the opposite situation had happened he would be all for it."
180,"Bovine Excrement. Like Doc says, the Bill of Rights do not give us our rights, it only list them or enumerated, or numbered them.

181,Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.
182,"Hahahaha, there could be 100 crazed flat-earth creationists joining with me in asking questions about evolution and astronomy, and it wouldn’t be within light years of the panic and scrambling that evolutionists/atheists have been doing for years now concerning ID. This thread is just aimed at watching the dances. Would I be getting the insults I’m getting in this thread if they all didn’t find this troubling? At least I’m not advocating hauling astronomy to court and getting it thrown out of significant parts of the public realm. Do you think they’re all genuinely mystified that someone would suggest that other branches of science be held to the same criteria that evolutionists have set for ID? This thread wouldn't exist without it, a lot of controversy wouldn't exist without it, the thoughtfulness and usefulness of science has been thrown into confusion just because militant atheists found a branch of it they didn't personally like, and emotionally set criteria for it that they don't want applied to other branches of it that they do like. Science has been taken over by atheists, and now it's political. It's going to stay that way. Atheists shouldn't complain about it - they caused it."
183,"I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.  Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation."
184,"And if they're stolen that means that they're illegally possessed by a currently illegal supplier. And since they're illegally possessed by an illegal supplier, that means that they're obviously not bothered by the current laws cocnerning firearms possession by criminals, meaning that banning gun ownership won't even make them blink."
185,"the question doesnt mean to ask what part of the universe or what direction/location is God. it means how did the concept of God get itself to mankind. think about it. we live in a time influenced strongly by information and technology. in the earlier ages, myths and mysteries dominated cultures and society. suppose mankind started off in the state of physical understanding that we are in today, meaning, suppose we always understood the body, the earth, the cosmos, etc, in the way we understand them today. do you think that people would still come to the conclusion that God exists?"
186,"Bryan. How is this statement then.  Terry Stops are not warranted just because a policeman, police chief, mayor, complainent, (Read Sinjin ) or even Governor does not like the fact that the citizens of that state have the legal Right to Open Carry. And, In Fact, are harassment and poor citizenship for it's lack of respect for the laws of this country and or that state?  Overreaching?"
187,But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No. Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No.
188,"Well again, this is not what the Bible claims of itself.  2Ti 3:16 All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:  17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.  In fact, Jesus himself quotes Genesis as though it were literal history (cf. Genesis 2:24 and Matthew 19:4, 5). Additionally, Jesus himself said that he was subject to the Old Testament:  Matthew 5:17 Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.  The  law and the prophets  are a common reference for  scripture  or the Old Testament. Either the Bible is what it claims to be, or it is not. If it is not what it claims to be, then how can we possibly trust that Jesus was who he claimed to be? The two concepts are directly tied together."
189,"this is not true. the intangible, such as time, ideas and emotions, are just as real to atheists as anybody else. atheists dont subscribe to a spiritual realm, but that doesnt mean they dont agree on the existence of the non-physical. there is a difference"
190,"No. I think that certian people are going to continue chiping away at the constution until things reach a critical mass, then there will be a violent correction. It is inevitable that a government whose growth is as radical as our governments will eventually collapse under it's own weight (see  Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire ).  The majority of Americans cannot describe america without including the words  freedom  and  rights . These are the supposed cornerstones of American society. When people see our constition, especially the bill of rights, chipped away at, I think it makes them uncomfortable, even if they do tolerate it."
191,"So would genetic enhancement 100 years ago! Peace,"
192,"No Doc. Obama will be happy for Reo. It is compassionate, Social justice stuff, and all!"
193,"Kellermann, in one of his studies, compared criminal homicides to legally justifiable homicides. He compared homicides to homicides (FBI data does the same) which seems more fair than your comparison- comparing only gun homicides to all types of crime supposedly prevented by crime according to one very controversial study. And I never said the war on drugs was a mistake."
194,"Well, if my points in this thread are so easy to refute then why do you focus on addressing arguments made in another thread? I'm not fooled by anyone who claims to have a winning hand but won't show others his cards."
195,"Yep, the cops will protect you as will the State emoticon_rolleyes  Is that your teabagger sinjin?"
196,"probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel."
197,"Why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is Arab or not? Aren't the Arab and non-Arab created by God? Why all this discrimination among the creation of God?  eanassir"
198,Another nail in the case to seal the borders. Relatively easy to spot the cure unless one is terminally stupid. If a country has a problem is it the job of the USA to solve it for them or is it up to the country with the problem? The answer is easy unless you are of a leftist tilt. In other words not the problem of the USA. Only a liberal could think it was.
199,Actually what they are really doing is ignoring silly irrelevent questions from clueless people with a religious agenda to promote.
200,"Huh, what is more important?  The constant messages of acceptance, tolerance and love in the bible, far too numerous to count  OR  The few and far inbetween (what tops 3?) vague passages possibly about homosexuality.  I used to go to church and my pastor (a woman by the way) kept stressing that the important things in the bible are the ones that are repeated time and time again.  Obviously the UCC understands this but many people here don't."

205,"At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?"
206,"Yes. We all ask this question of creationists who propose that the universe was created out of nothing - poof! But science doesn't try to answer that question. We do know that the universe began expanding about 13.7 billion years ago. What went before that and the cause for the expansion isn't known and at present, and may never be knowable. However, we do know that particles can and do spring into existence from nothing, for no apparent reason. Google ""Casimir effect"" and read about one example. Wikipedia will probably be the 3rd entry. This something from nothing is an effect from the zero-point energy of a vacuum."
207,"And I have never seen a non-living process chase a rabbit either. But that does not imply by any logic which I have ever encountered that rabbit chasing is a key characteristic of all living organisms. Perhaps in your world some means all but not in mine. The question is not whether SOME living systems exhibit volition, some do. The question is whether ALL living systems exhibit volition - many do not. Those that do not could not have evolved at all if evolution requires volition."
208,"Ho, hum... humanist, atheistic babble that does nothing but keep you running in circles, thinking you are actually getting somewhere."
209,"Yes, I know what it is. I also know of mothers who have never breast-fed.  Are you trying to imply that, because a baby is sometimes breast-fed, it retains a biological connection to the mother similar to the umbilical cord? I'd call that stretching the boundaries of 'biological connection', personally...  Before birth, if the mother dies, the foetus dies (with one noticable exception that I know of). After birth, this is no longer the case."
210,"Just because the bible is over 2000 years old doesn't make it unreliable, I mean your placing all your money on a billion year old one cell organism. You don't have any absolute proof and neither do I."
211,And I guess it doesn't have anything to do with brain size either.
212,Easy. There are none. I think about what I do and do what seems best in any given situation.
213,"All you have said is there are two apples. I noticed you said ""describe"", I can describe what a chair is, but that description is not the chair itself. Are the apples the ""law of non-contradiction""?"

216,"Yes, it's a common problem that nutjob parody posts can be hard to distinguish from sincere nutjobs posts. This is an artifact of how utterly ridiculous the nutjob position is."
217,No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.
218,Because the current neo-cons running the Republican party do not want a political discourse. They just want to deny reality and hold power like spoiled children.
219,"Any belief system is a religion loosely defined.  I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights.  Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?"
220,I know that. It was not my intention to show that a deity does not exist; I wanted to refute the fundamentalist interpretation (again).

227,"Well I'm pretty sure if it was cyber-enhancements then that dog never would have been born for you to see. It would be in a lab somewhere. You are right that it is possible that this is the case, but over time you would have found out about it assuming the dog was born for you to see indicating there is no cover-up or secret made of it and you would learn all about it in the future. A year goes by, scientists say it was genuine evolution. Would that be enough evidence?"
228,"Well this doesn't answer my question though. With this bill, where is the money coming from? Are we cutting doctors jobs? I hate to use a Krugman thing but this looks like an  underpants gnomes  theory.  1) Pass Senate Bill  2) ???????  3) Save $3,000 per capita."

230,"im not saying that my worldview is 100% provable because i live by faith but my faith is not blind, it makes sense to what we see in the world. However, if one examines the atheists worldview, it has lots of things that it cannot account for. All that exist is matter; do I excuse a rock for tripping me? They cannot account for morals. If morals come from man, then man can change them, if they come from majority consensus, it still begs the question is the majority right? The majority can change. If we are born with them, I could say, I was born to kill. (Animals do not have morals why should we?)"
231,"Yes, everyone is a ""potential"" felon. Fortunately most people never commit a felony. And there are many different types of weapons, all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence."
232,"No, that is not true. What about miracles?"

That said, science will only allow what IT decides is ""valid"", just like the church.Science defines what is valid and what isn't, just like the church.""Instantaeneous"" comunication and large volumes of scientists does NOT make science any more right, it meerly increases the volume of stuff that they come up with.And again, your point brings back the arguement that when technology proggresses further we may still discover things which force science to re-write their books. Your view is purely subjective, even the evidence itself is opinion."
236,So the initial murder wasn't enough to show  that they are willing to commit acts of violence ? This makes absolutely no sense.
237,So you view is that their religious freedom is more important then mine? That their families are more important then mine?
238,"Because, not once, did I have feel any sort of physical attraction to the same gender as myself. I have known other people who have. I don't 'CHOOSE' who I think is sexually attractive.  It might have been environmental, but it certainly wasn't a 'choice'  I have to assume that at least for some , if not most homosexuals, that pattern repeats itself."

240,Wrong and wrong.
241,"Yes, prove it by science. I don't want you to keep reverting to word games/sophistry; philosophical arguments. You must prove it by science. Show me the scientific experiment that proves it. I've asked you a number of times, and every time you've failed to do so."

243,"Oh, any of the bases can degrade. Guanine is just the most reactive.  Some guy down the hall works on nothing but guanine adducts on oligonucleotides. The type of DNA lesion is also determined by the sequence right around the guanine, so there are sequence-specific lesions and adducts.  I think once people realize that DNA is very easily mutated and that the cellular machinery needed to repair it is pretty complex and imperfect, then they will see that mutations happen all the time and there are so many that some of them will just turn out to be  beneficial  or at least not detrimental.  Here's an example of 8-oxo-guanine actually inhibiting the DNA repair process.  http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/277/24/21300"

Here's a portion he purposely excised:"
247,We aren't. Not even in literature classes are we taught this.
248,"Oh God, not again. You're correct in the fact that the fossil record doesn't prove evolution. Fossils, being the lithified remains of long dead organisms, have great problems providing any evidence on thier genetic make-up. What the fossil record does show is cases where, over time, modifications can be seen in animals morphology. There is also the fact you can find animals which are 'almost' another type of animal. A good example is Synapsids (otherwise known as 'Mammal-like reptiles'). The fossil record provides data which is best explained by the ToE, rather than 'Goddidit'. The argument between ToE and ID is not something in which the fossil record can be involved.As far as I can tell, you don't talk about God as the personalised deity that most mainstream christian traditions talk about. In fact you seem to have a rather 'hippy-ish' view in that God is an energy. Just so you know, the idea that humans die when seeing Gods goes back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Zeus killed one of his lovers when she demanded to see him in his true form (just by the power revealed in him). I think she was the mother of Perseus or something....Just so you know, if God is a force, we've probably already picked him out and got him down as an unexplained physical constant, and if he's a spirit, we can't pick him up scientifically, and therefore aren't trying to prove him or disprove him. It's true that we are not hugely advanced in terms of our understanding, but we are hugely advanced beyond 5-600 years ago, when the christians were doing thier best to burn anyone who asked questions. Nowadays we agree that Gallileo was a very smart man, rather than a heretic. Religion still has a place today, but it no longer directs the entire course of human life."

251,"Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always.  In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves.  Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases."
252,"Actually, no they could not find oil without evolution. It's not only a matter of finding ""certain rocks"" associated with oil, but by reconstructing the paleo-environment. Only certain environments, indicated by types of rocks and the types of animals/plants that existed at that time, are suitable for the production of petroleum.In fact, a lot of mineral resources are located by certain geologic formations as interpreted by modern theories of geology. Without a knowledge of biological and geological evolution prospectors would waste a lot of time looking in the wrong places."

254,"Well the continual occurrence of shootings at schools that outlaw concealed carry, vs the lack of any shootings at schools that allow concealed carry, would suggest something along those lines."
255,"Yes, according to JimmyJ.  God, the laws regarding murder from all over the world, have absolutely no impact upon the holy proclamations emanating from JimmyJ."
256,"Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose. I'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion. And of course, mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection."
257,"Well, why need Jesus then? For salvation from sin.  Well, where did this sin originate? From Adam and Eve starting the fall of man from grace.  Well, they never existed..."
258,"Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this: ""My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject"".Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it."
259,Black panthers?  MLK died before Heston was NRA presdent?  Heston ran for office?  A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to  win  an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of  reasoning  has the following form:  1. Topic A is under discussion.  2. Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).  3. Topic A is abandoned.  Either connect the dots or shut up!
260,"Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes.  However Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell."
261,If something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then I would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website.  Maybe I should give a list of all the homosexuals in my community to a group of drunk rednecks...  this is as bad as the registered sex offender list.
262,this statement isn't logical.  It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can't change them...or even that they apply to him. If a teacher says  no talking in the classroom  it doesn't apply to the teacher now does it.
263,"You do realize you are asking a question to an issue that has multiple definitions with a pigeonholed response? It is like asking group X whether they support or condemn sex but not defining sex with who, with or when. Most people would respond with a yes but this doesn?t mean they?d condone rape.  To either support or condemn statuary consent laws incredibly depends on the multiple definitions of ?age of consent? provided by the lawmakers."
264,"Do you believe that the freedom to not participate in any religion whatsoever is not covered by the expression ""Freedom of Religion""?"
265,Can you explain spiritual beings?  I honestly don't know what that means.
266,"You know, I'm all for punny jokes (even moreso than most people), but that's not what I meant. I seriously want a designist explanation for the development, as opposed to the Hovindian ""it is an anchor point for muscles"" explanation of its existence. (Although, it's not as if we don't have any examples that don't have that ""problem."")"
267,"Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a ""link,"" whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!"
268,"WOW, and you claim to be a teacher? No matter our kids have the lowest scores in the World. Didn't you know that it was the democratic south that started the civil war to fight against the abolition of slavery? And didn't you know that it was the democratic party that fought hardest against the 1964 civil rights act? Until Johnson finally submitted a watered down bill compared to the Republican bill due to political and public pressure?"
269,"So it's the scientific community that sets up communication within a society, and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up? Hahaha - sorry but I'm not convinced."
270,"Actually no, when laws are made based on one specific concept of one paticular faith system, if FORCES all CITIZENS to live by that faith."
271,And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it's all better. I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women.
272,"Did I ever say I had proof of no god? I just said I have no proof of god. And I never even claimed anything close to the fact that there is no god. I said that there is no proof of a god and no proof of no god. The thing I pointed out was your double-standard. You don't believe in parallel universes because there is no proof, yet you believe in God. Where is your proof there and there not proof for parallel universes. If you want to know what I believe, I really believe that what happens after death is irrelevant. I'm going to live based on what I know. I know that I am alive (or think I am). I know how to live it to the fullest (and it doesn't involve church or praying). I will live the way I want to which is probably very similar to the way you live yours. I haven't killed anyone, I try not to lie, I don't steal. I have probably about the same morals you do, except for one thing. I don't derive these morals from the fact that if I don't live by them I will burn in hell. I live by them because I know they are the right thing to do. I will not live my life out of fear, I will live my life the best way I know how based on what I know. If there's a god, he shouldn't have a problem with how I'm living my life and if he does have a problem, I don't want to listen to him anyway."
273,So conservatives can give shout their brand of lies as the truth but a liberal who calls them on it isn't being tolerant?
274,"And yet, in this case, your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage. And you aren't outraged by that? That's what I don't understand. The article focused on Palin 'needing to clarify', but didn't even take Biden to task for being against gay marriage!  I would think you'd want to know WHY he's against gay marriage. Particularly since he's your preferred candidate, and gay marriage seems to be a very important issue to you. But hey, maybe you don't care!"
275,"Oh it will and from what I have seen of the arguments the court will strike down prop 8 and every anti gay marriage amendment. I have seen the reinactments taken from the trial record.  YouTube - Prop 8 Trial Re-enactment, Day 1 Chapter 1"
276,"Not everything is simply black or white.  John 14:13-14,  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ask any think in my name, I will do it.   Does any one understand what  anything  means?[/quote]  If you want it to simply be black and white then I'll let you know that it is false."
277,"Any geologists want to help me out here?What they mean by this is that there are sediments in one place and sediments in another place. They can date them radiometrically to determine that they are both from the Edicarian period (even though they may be seperated by millions of years). They then verify that they are Edicarian by looking at the layering to determine if the two pieces were at one point connected, but are now seperated due to tectonics.I'm sure I'm not entirely correct about these methods.I think I'd better study up on some of these qeustions HERE.Maybe you should too."
278,And the religious have killed many millions more because the others did not believe in the  right  God.
279,"Good, this isn't the time for either side to be making politically motivated comments, even if the case is over a week old."
280,"Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of  creation science  and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.  But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science."
281,"This is more accurate, but let me modify it a bit.  Without evidence there is no reason to conclude that there MUST be a god.  A lack of evidence does not ensure that there is no god, just that we can't assume that there is."
282,"Huh? Please expound how the Gates, the Gettys, the Kennedys, the Hiltons, the Rockafellers dominate the poor with guns. The rich can afford and can legally own them right now. Are they enslaving the poor right now at the end of a gun barrel?  Please explain that if a common man can store, use, and own modern military weapons as safe or even safer that the state; that he/she should not be allowed to own military weapons."
283,"Not between nonrandom variation and directed variation: between nonrandom amounts of variation, and directed variation.For instance, if I heat up a kettle of water, the motion of the liquid becomes more violent. The amount of motion is non-random, linked as it is to the temperature of the water, but the motion itself is random.Is that satisfactory?Taking things a step further, we can also observe that the motion of the water, while random, is nevertheless constrained by the kettle. This is analogous to the 'developmental constraints' mentioned in the article you quote. I confess to seeing nothing problematic for the ToE in the idea that natural selection would favour genomes that are less susceptible to some mutations than to others."
284,"Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are  better suited  than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there?"
285,"Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?  Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.  Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?"
286,They don't have to. The government is exercising violence by threatening people with jail time if they cause injury to somebody else who's attacking them.
287,"And how would they be able to trace those 30 percent back to gun shows, if there are no background checks carried out? Hm? Care to explain that one for the rest of the class?  If they're coming from private transactions, then there's no record, and the number made up is pure BS. If they came from a licensed dealer who was doing business at a gun show, then it would be no different from them being traced to a licensed gun store."
288,"Oh, okay, I understand it now. I still think it sounds quick but then again, I'm not a member of the bird family.:p"
289,"And a combination of both long and short hair will insulate better than both. That is why so many animals of the Arctic have a combination of both long and short hair. By the way, short wooly hair is a better insulator than long straight hair."
290,"The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted. I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word ""phenomena"" is vague. The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths."
291,Because evolution is the main weapon that is used against traditional U.S. morals and customs.
292,"Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done"
293,"Material  The substance or substances out of which a thing is or can be made.  http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=material  So, in fact the defintion for material is that it is made of material  So therefore, according to Mach, because that definition is of itself, it can't exist.  Of course he could say it's atoms etc., but that's what material makes up, not what makes up material"
294,Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.
295,"I think Peddler and Ray have lots of good ideas, and they will be able to explian everthing. Just give them a chance! Stop bothering them with more questions so that they can actually concentrate on one of them instead of getting loads more. Sheesh!"
296,"Well said.  You could put it in the form of a resolution, in the debate challanges forum."
297,"With all due respect my friend, this is foolishness. It's as if you're saying that a persons existence is based on their memories from their past. That is ridiculous because if it's true then, we oughta take every person who's in the throws of Alzhiemers out and euthanize them because they can't remember what they did yesterday. Just because you can't remember what you did at 4 doesn't negate for one moment that you still existed at 4 so your existence had value and substance even though you can no longer remember what happened back then in your life."
298,"This is not true. Rather, when there is conflict between one's sanctity of life vs another's quality of life, the sanctity of life must win."
299,And what sort of evidence have you put forth that we can't refute?  Do we need to recite your long list of hoaxes?
300,I know I know. Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish.
301,"Foolish Clergymen.  How can this work? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart.  You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs. It simply must be all or nothing. Otherwise you are wasting your time."
302,"I know there&#8217;s an explanation for everything, that&#8217;s why God isn&#8217;t praised as much as He should be. I tend to thank Him for all things. It&#8217;s a habit of mine. I just thought that I&#8217;d throw in my 2 cents worth. No harm intende"
303,"Actually both are relative in every situation. Especially ""The Truth"" as espoused by religious fundamentalists such as yourself, as there are as many different versions of the truth as there religious fundamentalists."
304,"So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized ""Good morning, sweetie"", that would be an answer?"
305,So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
306,"I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger, another police official said.How is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?Besides that little piece about lacking awareness I don't really buy it.A gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?Serious question, Penfold,and I will even dispense with the COMRADE,are you a plant just to get people going?or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm?and if so I apologizeemoticonXBangheademoticonXBanghead.'"
307,"But if one can be a person without having unique DNA, then your qualification is at best incomplete. As it stands, it follows from your claim that monozygotic multiple births are not people.See my further deconstruction of your arguments in your own ""Kill! Kill! Kill!"" thread."
308,"Well, Satan was invented to explain why there is evil in the world.. the dualism. He was adopted by the Hebrews under the influence of Persia. However, in the Jewish religion, Satan is not this incredilbly evil being out to corrupt souls, but rather just an angel (who had no free will), whose job it was to provide for bad choices so that people may choose GOOD ,and thus live more sanctified lives by their own actions."
309,Thank God South Africa is taking such a great step forward into the future. Prejudice is terrible and it's so damn bad when people are blinded by hypocrisy.
310,"And? Ignoring your absurd claim that an embryo can choose its location, why does it matter. There is nobody living inside of the baby, it is not mentally existing. It would be the equivalent of chopping someone's head off and calling the body a person."
311,"nah, I was just poking fun because I can! Personally, this isn't a debate. It is a joke. I also think duo could be right that it is an evolution person."
312,"**  The darwinian notion has had no payoff. The fact of evolution, as descent with modification from one or a few common ancestors, predates darwin by hundreds of years, and is not the private property of materialism/mechanism/darwinism.  The real  payoffs come from 2 sources--the understanding of inheritance that grew out of Mendel's inheritance theory, and the concept of dynamic systemic 'adaptation', as opposed to passive particulate 'selection', in evoltion.  Have to go now."
313,"It has ceased to fascinate me how much anti-evolutionists fail to understand evolution. Do you want to back up this assertion, or were you just hoping to get in a free pathetic driveby potshot?"
314,It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.
315,"Please read carefully. He was talking about the US population, not the world.  The initial post was NOT detailing population control but bringing up the issue of resource allocation and parenting."
316,"Sorry but I think you are mistaken in that the bible ""describes"" dinosaurs. The first description is most certainly a description of the hippopotamus, which were abundant in Egypt, etc. The second seems to be crocodile of some sort. Most likely the Nile crocodile. Tanniyn is not just described as dragon, but also as serpent or scaly creature. At that time there was no other large scaly creature other than the Nile crocodile. They might have been describing a whale, but whales do not have scales.As to your claim of evolution, that depends on what ""God"" would mean by ""create."" YOU can create something out of something else can't you? So than evolution is a possibility."
317,It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
318,"So Simone, if the shooter had instead driven his Toyota Prius into a crowd, killing many as a result, would you call for banning Toyota Priuses?"
319,"Actually, the bird is fully feathered. The feathers offer insulation and of course, when impregnated with oil, buoyancy. Where did you get your information? Well, no matter. You bought it hook, line and sinker. Did it occur to you that you should possibly check your ""facts""?"
320,"No it isn't. There was an incident here in the states last year that had an elderly woman beaten and raped, and several days later her rapist came back to do it again and she killed him on the spot. She wasn't brought to court to face trial even know she killed someone.THAT is how something like this should be handled."
321,"But Peddlar's religion doesn't have reincarnation in this way so parasitised by wasps as a punishment isn't one of the options. Unless of course we are in Hell at the moment but just haven't realised it yet and avoided the worst stuff.  Still, I have a problem with punishing someone for something that they now have no idea about with something fairly horrific yet will forget soon as they die again, if they are even really aware of what is happening."
322,"NOW YOU'RE SMOKING CRACK HERE DUDE.I'm sure there are some people that deal all kinds of things, but someone who regularly sells pot pretty much only sells pot. I'm not saying 100%of the time, but pot smokers don't go into some ghetto crackhouse to get their pot.Jesus, man, are you that out of touch?"
323,"Just like no one is really ""for"" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war."
324,"Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is ""settled law"" and the subsequent power to make it so?  I didn't think so."
325,"So, you don't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun?? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one."
326,Lackmarian evolution died a long time ago. Why haven't you?
327,"Economic systems have everything to do with morality. Morality also includes the concepts of fairness and justice and fair play.  People do not like to be cheated. They do not like to be victims of fraud. If economic systems are not governed and regulated, people can be victimized by the systems."
328,"Yes it can, because they can/do own firearms besides those issued by the government. Plus, once they are retired from the military, they get to keep their rifles or pistols. Every round of the military's ammo is acounted for, because they don't want them waisting their money... They can shoot as much of their private stock as they want. Also, they have very stringent guidelines on cleaning your weapons."
329,"You can't stop stupid, or accidents, from happening. No matter what policy you might try and enact. Just look at all the school shootings in Germany of all places. All the school massacres in China."
330,"Nah, it is a gateway in the fact that herion addicts and crack addicts are in the same room and are the same friends of yours that supply the marijuana. Would legalization help this? I dunno, but probably cause many other problems without everyone legalizing it."
331,"Yes, yes, jyoshu is still struggling with this one?  1. Change the definition of a legal term, something that is done daily, to benefit a class of citizen currently discriminiated against legally and socially.  2. Don't change any legal definition, evar!  I suspect #1 helps the greatest number of people, and hurts no one.  #2 of course helps no one, and hurts gays.  Quite an easy moral choice if you ask me.  Of course, in jyoshu's dream-land,  voter  would still be defined as a white male. God bless the primitives.  -Mach"
332,"No, the legal middle ground between no same-sex marriage and only same-sex marriage is marriage for all, just as the legal middle ground between no opposite-sex marriage and only opposite-sex marriage is marriage for all.  Another possiblity would be marriage for none, but let's not go there."
333,That is what a straw purchaser gets. 10 years in a Federal Prision.
334,"So your answer is to just continue with the way things are now: continue forcing the law-abiding to go unarmed and let only the shooter have exclusive access to guns so they can kill all they want? How many unarmed people have to be killed in a ""gun free zone"" before you come to realize that mandating unarmed and helplessness will do nothing to save even a single life?"
335,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"
336,"Yes. A proper understanding of rights is neccessary to know when you are aggressing against another person. Most children learn about rights intuitively through social interaction, a child take's another child's toy ""That's mine"", they say, they may fight over it, but they learn that when people lay contrary claims to things, violent conflict is the result.It is useful to refine this intuitive belief system into something consistent, both individually, and in shaping the law of a society. A society in which people work together through trade and friendship will always be more prosperous and safe than one in which rights are systematically ignored and violent conflict is the norm.It is not useful to talk about rights with people who treat them as subjective, based on value judgements, ie ""People have a right to life, because life is more valuable than being able to have an abortion"", or ""People have a right to have an abortion, because being able to have an abortion is more important than a fetus"". There is nothing to debate, we may as well go over whether strawberry or chocolate is a better flavour for a milkshake. In a free society we can disagree over what is ""more important"" and make our own choices, but if value judgements are used to determine law, the only possible outcome is the oppression of those with minority values.No argument can be made about value judgements, they do not convince anyone, they do not provide just solutions. Politically, to demand your values be enforced (by virtue of your political power) is to demand the rule of force rather than justice.There are only two choices: The rule of law, justice, a free society, built on the moral foundation of individual rights - or the rule of the majority, built on the arbitrary value judgements and preferences of those weilding power."
337,"100 percent of all drug related killings in Mexico are committed purely with American weapons?  So now you're saying that the drug cartels are getting all those anti-aircraft cannons and rocket propelled grenades and fragmentation grenades, for absolutely nothing? With all of those billions upon billions of dollars and political influence the cartels have, they have to rely exclusively on the American firearms market to ensure that they kill their rivals and anybody that gets in their way?"
338,"But you have heard of ID, right? And you think that ID - pushed by the Discovery Institute - is somehow science?"
339,But the Court went further than necessary. They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the  right to abortion  ON DEMAND at any time. That was an exercise in judicial activism. They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied. It's not the Court's function to legislate from the bench. It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus' rights are protected.
340,Can't be dissapointed if I know not to expect more...
341,"And yet, in this case, your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage. And you aren't outraged by that? That's what I don't understand. The article focused on Palin 'needing to clarify', but didn't even take Biden to task for being against gay marriage!  I would think you'd want to know WHY he's against gay marriage. Particularly since he's your preferred candidate, and gay marriage seems to be a very important issue to you. But hey, maybe you don't care!"
342,"Iuris, there is something, I want to say something Zenlike in this statement--but I am not sure."
343,Wrong and no one has ever called bone marrow an inner sanctum and I don't know what a baby's tabernacle might be.
344,ItÂ’s not my responsibility to ease job requirements so that an underachiever can reap the same rewards as an achiever. ThatÂ’s not my idea of equality.
345,"A model of a live fish and fossils of a fish are going to be significantly different under any circumstances.There was a gap in the fossil record, scientists looked it at it, and using the theory of evolution mindset, automatically assumed that it went extinct millions and millions of years ago. But of course, it was absolutely wrong.A prediction was made based on the theory of evolution and it was absolutely wrong. Simple."
346,"In reality, there are no concrete 'reasons' for believing in God. If you believe in God, you believe based on faith. There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists... unless you first believe through faith that God exists."
347,And here is a nice example of good old materialist science hard at work on real world problems important to all of us. Note well the gentic and evolutionary emphasis. Of course this is useless since its not EAM but the scientists can only try using the best concepts they can find.
348,"I disagree. I've been in a loving, committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively...how does this have a negative affect on you?"
349,"When the founding fathers determined that religion should not be established, nor prohibited from being freely exercised, they probably wouldn't have considered atheism (the assertion that there is no God) to be a religion, because at the time it wasn't organized, or funded. The Judeo Christian religions were organized and funded at the time, as were other types of religion. They weren't concerned with what beliefs majorities or minorities had, they were concerned with impositions a religion could put on segments of the population with their organizational requirements, or money issues. They could see atheists needing protection from religion, but they couldn't see religion needing protection from atheism, because it wasn't organized. While it can be argued that atheism is not a religion, it can't be argued that it isn't an EQUIVALENT to religion today, with the organization and funding that it now has. 200 years ago, an organization needed buildings and meetings and transportation to be organized. With today's communications, it does not. Just type ""atheism"" in any search engine and note the organization, and political action. I'm not using the term ""atheism"" in a derogatory manner. It's an assertion that there is no God. But today it's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight, thanks to modern communications. It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion, and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion. It cannot claim science as its god, and force it upon public education.3) One of the most interesting things about this whole issue is the fact that the same thing, only reversed, was going on in the US 100 years ago. http://www.campusmagazine.org/articl...2-2f7cc3afdb0fThe concept of evolution was recently founded at that time, and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it, and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools. Today, the concept of intelligent design, (void of any certain religion and its associated faith) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists, who are afraid of it in exactly the same way.  I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows. Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding. If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance. In the words of biologist Arthur Jones;"
350,No worries. I actually had to read it twice before I caught that - at first I was thinking the same as you did.
351,So you're blaming America's higher murder rate than other developed nations on poor police work and the criminal justice system? America already has a higher incarceration rate than other developed nations. Gun activists keep telling us we need to lock more people up and keep them locked up for longer. If that's the standard by which criminal justice systems can be evaluated then America is doing a better job. So how can the difference in murder rates be blamed on America's criminal justice system?
352,"The fact that the sun rises every day is not evidence for the sun orbiting the Earth, this effect is seen because of the rotation of Earth.ToE does not state that ""life forms are similar to each other"".Direct evidence for ID/Creationism has never been established so there is no reason to suppose it to be true.Direct evidence for allele frequency change is freely available for all to see.You also need to define original, useful DNA.4/10.

360,"Well maybe that will teach him to get a education for once. Still, my analogy is quite true.  Furthermore both words are meant by creationists to argue evolution is faith. Dishonest, but that is essentialy the mantra of creationism.   Lie, cheat, steal and fabricate to get people to be believe. "

363,"So, whether the embryo/fetus/whatever-you-want-to-call-it has rights seems to be a non-issue. Because, for pro-choice folk, even if it has rights, it still is preferable to ensure that it can be legally killed.Of course, it is obvious to everyone that an entity does not need rights in order to have legal protections. But I'll let that slide for now."

But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money."
366,"Then you don't actually have a definition of information that is meaningful. I didn't think you did. By the way, increase in the amount (i.e., more letters) of DNA has often been observed.

367,"cmitch, you cite certain studies as the reasons for why laws have been passed forbidding underage drinking and gambling. Do you, by chance, know what those studies are?  Furthermore, why would your being legally unable to drink or gamble make you less of a human?  Does drinking and gambling make you more human?  I'm having difficulties in following your arguments."
368,"And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a  high powered rifle  despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?  And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!  Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics."
369,And now you say that gun owners are cowards?
370,"And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids. If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans, this is no more than scientific honesty."
371,"I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal. What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be. However, I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away. Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago."

373,"Here is what your link says. It is shocking that we have discovered this SCAM has been going on for decades leading up to the current Cap and Trade Legislation and Treaties which will indebt average americans to paying for a scam to the tune of billions of dollars per year. Again, from your link:Scientific progress depends on accurate and complete data. It also relies on replication. The past couple of days have uncovered some shocking revelations about the baloney practices that pass as sound science about climate change.It was announced Thursday afternoon that computer hackers had obtained 160 megabytes of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in England. Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world. Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims.Professor Phil Jones, the head of the Climate Research Unit, and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University, who has been an important scientist in the climate debate, have come under particular scrutiny. Among his e-mails, Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the ""trick of adding in the real temps to each series ... to hide the decline [in temperature].""Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that ""scientists often used the word 'trick' to refer to a good way to solve a problem 'and not something secret.' "" Though the liberal New York newspaper apparently buys this explanation, we have seen no benign explanation that justifies efforts by researchers to skew data on so-called global-warming ""to hide the decline."" Given the controversies over the accuracy of Mr. Mann's past research, it is surprising his current explanations are accepted so readily.Here's more on this travesty: The Global Warming Scam Notice that the IPCC which has been the source for global warming lies which its defenders have been posting here for years has been deep into the scam of misinforming the public. It should also be noted that European stock advisers have called for the selling off of alternative energy stocks in light of these scam revelations."
374,Sensible gun control? Please check the sensible gun control laws in the UK during the 1990s. The gun grabbers did not stop there. They now have a gun ban.   it is important to remember that this dilemma started with the euphemistic  sensible first step.  - http://www.tsra.com/sensible.htm  It can happen here.
375,"People like this guy, and Henry Hyde, Newt Gingrich, Robert Livingston, and so many others happen to be right wing republicans....isn't that peculiar?"

377,"Actually, monkeys do not change into humans. The ancestor of all primates had the potential to become many different things. If a primate were to change (somehow), it probably would not become human.By the way, such a change will not be shown within your lifetime. Aren't you aware of the thousands of years involved?"
378,No.  Try this: Object to blanket laws requiring a woman to remain pregnant without consideration for her personal circumstances.
379,"There is the ever popular ""smartest state"" report that places kansas at #15 in the nation. It can be found at http://www.morganquitno.com/edrank.htmA lot of kansas educators take exception to that report because it factors in things that may not be related. For example, Kansas kids score in the top 5 states in ALL testing categories, BUT, we score 38th in spending per pupil. We score poorly in teacher salaries (28), and do not have teachers on our school boards (conflict of interest). All those factors count against us, as well as several others. Then you have new jersey and vermont, where the kids apparently can't take a test, and where their average SAT scores may be confused with a shoe size, and they score in the top 5 because they spend a LOT more than kansas. A lot of people argue that they penalize states for efficiency in their education system. If you want the most comprehensive report out there, go to www.alec.org and request a copy of their ""report card for education"". I think it is free, and it breaks down the states by several categories. It is what I always used to figure out how good a job our system was doing."
380,"They can ""marry"" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was."
381,Yes but if you try to change it to something unrealistic it will not work and we end up with a lot of unwanted children who are very likely to grow up with serious problems.  I can?t think of anything sadder and more immoral then a policy that creates unwanted children as a side effect.  The religious are so worried about the period of time the child is basically not sentient and will make suffer those who are developed enough to actually be sentient all for the luxury of indulging their silly counter productive religious beliefs.
382,"I've always disliked this line of logic because it implies that the value of somebody's life depends on their relative accomplishments and it invites the counter argument that the unborn in question could also become a criminal. Indeed, it has been argued that abortion has reduced crime, poverty, overpopulation and the depletion of natural resources."
383,"You're kidding, right? Telescopes, microscopes, radio telescopes. Surely you've heard of these. And we even have devices called spectometers which let us see what wavelengths make up a sample of light.

384,"No, it sounds like he's saying people should be able to have arms so they can be trained to the point where they can be considered a well-regulated militia."
385,"I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy. First, you must realize that evolution is still a theory. Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution. We have the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics, the laws of thermodynamics. These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology. They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone. They are the Laws of the Universe. For evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase. Entropy is the tendency toward chaos. Increasing entropy means increasing chaos. The universe is winding down on an irreversible path. Every process that takes place in nature, whether mechanical, electrical, chemical, or biological is winding down, becoming more chaotic. All processes will finally cease, and the Universe will stop. That is a scientific fact. If the Universe is running down, becoming more chaotic all the time, how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly, more organized, more complex. Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes. Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba. The goo is total chaos. The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature. The odds of random mixing by weather, earthquake, etc. that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion. It's not going to happen.Thirdly, look at DNA. Scientists are mapping the human genome, the very basis of life itself. What are they finding? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being. Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher. And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human. How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature? Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world, but also be aware of himself as a unique person? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far, despite decades of study. What freak accident could possibly have occurred to give the first descendant of apes the first spark of awareness? "
386,"The title of the thread gives a false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage. Had the title said, pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage, his position would have appeared as obvious as his views are. She is attempting to make it sound like the christian community is split, but bible believing pastors wouldn't be caught dead endorsing what this pastor believes in any aspect of his so called faith."
387,"Yet rather than support his extraordinary claims with any defense that stands up to the slightest scrutiny, supersport once again spams us with another brand new thread saying the same thing that he's had refuted time and time again on countless forums...

394,"Evolution's evidence is that life is similar, you won't be able to find an exception I am sure."
395,"Inference is part of the scientific method -- probably the most important part, at that. Without it we would discover nothing, for we can prove very little to begin with. Bear in mind that  proof  is an extremely high standard. Proof is the level at which a proposition's truth value is necessary (ex: given how we define  two,  it is impossible for  two  to not be  one  plus  one ). Inference on the other hand is the only option outside of mathematics. With that in mind, the fact that we can't prove much of anything is more or less irrelevant; what we can do is find lots and lots of supporting evidence and safely infer information from it."

399,"I was not aware of this. Although I'm sure some creationists will explain this by blaming the  genetic degradation of amino acid-building biological components  on the fall, it's a great example of creationists appealing to superfast evolution.

The evidence is adequate for me and for much of the world's population... even many scientists (including evolutionists). You are in a loud minority, railing against the irrational hoards about you."
402,"I believe the question was ""who?""I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now."
403,I'm convinced.
404,Only one innocent bled in this case.
405,A curse? If you don't agree with it that's one thing. Many people have died because of Christianity. The Crusades killed many people just for not converting to Christianity. Gallileo was arrested for proposing the Earth revolves around the sun which was against the church. Atheism hasn't ever hurt anybody. And you call atheism the curse?
406,Human rights?  Is a human fetus (a human child in the fetal stage of their life) not a human life?  Do I even need to bother with linking to a dictionary on this one anymore?  Just one word;  Hypocrisy

413,"In the theory of evolution, it all started with life. I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution. It's not. The word evolution means change. In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars  evolve  in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.  Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the  theory of evolution,  it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest. Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant. One may postulate a magical, all powerful being that created the first life. The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time."

I'll have to look into the actual article and post again when I don't have to read all of their spin garbage.  I'll post later after reviewing the study, but as of right now, did you maybe, just maybe think this  connection  between abuse and abortion is due to the woman not wanting to bring a child into the world to be abused? That she doesn't want someone else to experience the abusive situation she is in? I know that's expecting a lot out of you, but just put in the effort to use your brain, and you might be suprised at what you discover.  Use some common sense, people, rather than parroting anti-choice rhetoric.  Edit: The actual study thing is here in case anyone wants to read the actual science rather than the garbage posted here. Just a cursory glance shows that the garbage they spewed (especially from that abortionfacts.com thing) has no basis in fact."

421,"Its odd that you would use that concept at all. Do you really think terms used to describe power structures in human organizations are applicable to cells and their subsystems? Genes are the heritable information store of cells, they perform their function, other subsystems perform other functions. The whole constitutes a living cell. The whole who is on top thing is an inapplicable concept. What counts is understanding the functions of the various subsystems. A cell is not a dominance heiracrchy."
422,and she got punished for it  Good thing too because it led to the law being changed.

But you have believed creationists who probably don't know as much as you. Kettlewell's work was not a fraud. He did the best he could with what he had and presented his work in peer reviewed literature. His work has nothing to do with creation. But it seems that creationists want to believe that all science is permanent and never changing. Thus, when re-evaluation of Kettlewell's work is done and flaws are pointed out, creationists loudly proclaim fraud and a victory for creation. Funny that it wasn't  creation scientists  who pointed out the flaws and it wasn't  creation scientists  who publicized them. It was done by two evolutionary biologists who didn't even mention creation."

University of California, Irvine, USA.  It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the  mitochondrial Eve  who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies."

Do you also support repealing the Fourth and Fifth Amendments (or the Canadian equivalent, if they have it), just to make cops' jobs easier? Allowing cops to use torture in interrogations would also make their jobs easier. Would you support that?"
431,"That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty."

441,"Actually, you have been lied to here from my knowledge. The fossil record does not show ""in-between types"". Darwin said that the absence of such intermediates was the ""most obvious and serious objection"" against his theory. Nearly 150 years later, Dr David Raup, the head of one of the great museums in America, said that the situation concerning missing links ""hasn't changed much"" and that ""we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwins times."" The Late Dr Colin Patterson was Senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History as well an being an evolutionist and a fossil expert. He wrote a significant book on evolution - but when someone asked him why he did not show any pictures of in-between forms in his book, he wrote the following:""I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutinoary transitinos in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualise such transformations, but where would he get the informatino from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic licence, would htat not mislead the reader? I wrote the text of my book four years ago [in the book he does talk of his belief in some transitions - my dialogue]. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet [famous fossil expert stephen J.] Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitinoal fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least ""show a photo of the fossil form which each type of organism was derived"". I will lay it on teh line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.""Patterson came under fire from fellow evolutionists for having made this and similar candid admissinos, and attempted to soften the remarks retrospectively. However, the language is clear and unmistakable. Stephen Jay Gould, evolutionist said this: ""The lack of transitional fossils is the trade secret of palaeontology"". All quotes came from ""The Revised Quote Book"". You interestingly bring up human evolution. Human evolution is blank and filled with a tonne of holes that would sink the Titanic. Let us go through the basic evolutionary candidates:* Australopithecines (Lucy fossil type):- Dr Charles Oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who have examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis (an objective method that does not  depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry), do not believ that these creatuers are human ancestors. He states that although initally it was though that they were human-like or at least intermediate between apes and humans, the reality is that they ""differ more from both humans and African apes than do these two living groups from each other. THe australopithecines are unique."" Recent CAT scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not  habitually walk upright, as many still insist. * Homo Habblis:- Many scientists (evolutionary scientists included) are now recognising that Habblis is a waste bin of two or more creatures, and hence, is an invalid category. Even so, the CAT scans have determined that Habblis was less  bipedal than Australopithecines. So we are actually ""de-evolving"" if you will. * Homo Erectus and Neandertals:- Once again, CAT scans have shown that Erectus and Neandertals walked up right just like us. They would be able to run,hop, skip, jump, etc, and do all the things that we do today. Many scientists now classify erectus and neandertals as ""true humans"". And it has been known that Neandertal types had been living at the same time as ""modern"" types. Tools found on an Indonesian island in associatino with stegodon (an extinct elephant) remains have cause evolutionist Dr Alan Thorne to suggest that these so-called ""pre-human ancestors"" had seafaring skills and technology. As far back as 1993 he said, ""They're not [i.e. shouldn't be called] Homo erecus, they're people"". This quote came from the Australian, 19 August 1993.If one uses the evolutionists' own timescales and criteria for classification and plots all ""hominid"" fossil discoveries on a chart, it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles. (M. Lubenow, ""Bones of Contention"").I found it interesting that you got your information from talkorigins.com. They totally do not know what they are talking about. In one article that I saw regarding SNRs they totally changed the scientific evidence to suit their own theory, as for one, the article was not written by an educated person, nor did it have any references - unlike the article on SNRs that was written by Answers in Genesis. Many of their arguments, like the one on your link can be easliy refuted. Other articles employ what is known as the ""straw man"" argument tactic, i.e. using an argument that can be easily refuted and one that is not held by anyone. If evolution is true, than we should expect to find millions and millions of fossils of in-between forms, right? Well, the truth is, we don't. Some evolutionists claim there are some - maybe a handful - of such in-between fossil types (highly, highly, highly debatable). Other leading experts have rejected soe or all of these. What is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature Archaeopteryx, often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for ""transitional"" status. The feathers are fully formed, and the wings are proper wings. It has the backward-facing claw and curved feet characteristic of perching birds. It wasmost definitely not, as some would reconstruct it, a running feathered dinosaur. In fact, the same can be shown to be true for whale evolution animals such as the Ambulocetus and the Basilosaurs. These are not evolutionary transitional forms, as you are often told. Many evolutionists do not even acknowledge them, but this does not mean that they don't believe in their theory.So in this respect, the fossil record does not show evolution as you are commonly told. In fact, it tells us that things breed true to their kind, i.e. horses produce horses, cats produce cats and so on.You than go onto challange:"

462,"The Big Bang was proved wrong years ago by Kent Hovind. Here's how:   20 billion years ago there was a Big Bang [what exploded: since the year 2006, scientists have claimed that nothing exploded into the universe! By one of the most famous laws of physics, matter can neither be created nor destroyed. Nothing can't explode into something. Also, where did that something come from? Where did the energy for the explosion come from?] that started as a microscopic dot and exploded and expanded faster than the speed of light. It started out as a very hot, very dense region that was smaller than a period. [As you know, when matter is heated, it expands. For something to be hot enough to explode faster than the speed of light, it would have to be larger than our minds can comprehend.] Eventually, all of the matter in the universe will again be compressed into a infinitesimal speck. [We know that the universe is expanding outward. It cannot possibly expand from light years to something smaller than an atom.] When the universe was a dot, it spun clockwise faster and faster until it exploded. [The Law of Angular Momentum states that if an object breaks apart in a frictionless environment, then the fragments will all spin the same direction. Yet if the universe started out as a spinning speck and exploded, then how is it that the universe is filled with exceptions where moons, planets, and even whole galaxies are spinning backwards?] To sum it all up, the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and here we are!'"

493,"THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATIONby Alan KorwinDear Editor,Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns, so here it is. How exactly would writing down my name, or your name, help arrest criminals or make you safer? Although at first blush, gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal, on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all.The unfortunate answer is that, no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears, registering honest gun owners doesn't stop criminals, and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction. It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal, if that goal is the reduction of crime.1. Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive.Do you know what it takes to run a database that big? You need 19,000 changes daily, just to keep up with people who move every ten years. Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs, payroll, parking and dry cleaning bills. It's a government jobs program all by itself, all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime. How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done? That's right, none, and the planners know that. All that money and time, invested on tracking the innocent. That's why so many police departments are against it -- they'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources, and hire clerks instead of cops.2. Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime.Under registration, activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon. Think about that. Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest, if the property isn't on the government's master list. Boy, that doesn't sound like the American way. No other evil is needed, there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place. Paperwork equals prison. That's just wrong.3. Registration, if enacted, will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade.How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants, before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties? People get what they want either way, it's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it. With respect to guns, the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy, for gun runners.4. People have said to me, ""But Alan, if all guns were registered and there was a crime, then you could tell.""Tell what? If your neighbor is shot, that's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius. The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive, opportunity, witnesses, physical evidence, the murder weapon. Police aren't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers. Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component.5. You don't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people, do you?Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York, California and Louisiana, and global history for the past century, this couldn't really happen, do you think? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America, with its Bill of Rights? The guarantees against confiscating property, unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power. Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures? (Unfortunately, it's a long list of usual suspects.)And what about the so-called First Amendment test? If it's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too. Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers? Why indeed.Pile logic on logic, some people just feel the government should register everything, just to keep control. When government has that much control, you no longer possess your liberties. You're living where government lists define who can do what, and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely. This form of ""gun control"" isn't about guns, it's about control.I might favor registration if the system would include criminals. In fact, I'd favor testing the system on them first. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a widely known case (Haynes v. U.S., 1968), had determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms, because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That's right, mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime, and is therefore prohibited.*Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the ""news"" media, engorges the federal or state bureaucracy, and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms. It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words, and should be rejected outright. Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve, protect and defend, and deserve to be removed from office.Sincerely,Alan Korwin, AuthorGun Laws of America* NOTE: This case only concerned a limited class of weapons, ""destructive devices,"" which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act. Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor, and not the transferee, of such devices to file papers, and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem. In U.S. v. Freed, 1971, the Court agreed the problem had been fixed (for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case).A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem. A prohibited possessor cannot have a firearm at all, so mere possession is a serious crime. An additional charge for failing to register the gun that can't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case. However, possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon, with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure. The innocent would have to register to remain legal, the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself."

Just because you're wrong doesn't make us  rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals.   You're still wrong. The age of the Universe has never in the past 50 years been thought to have been 4 billion years ago.  Yes. Speed of light calculated with distance from the origin of the oldest light, which equates to about 14 billion or so years.  Neanderthal were never a decedent of homo sapien. How many times have you been proven wrong on this thread alone?  I'd love to see this argument. As I recall, as others have said, Neanderthal and homo sapiens were contemporary species occupying some of the same geographical areas. Therefore they could not have been decedents of homo sapien as the two arouse roughly at the same time.  So I am correct about my asserations as to your education?  Still you completely fail to argue the merits of creationism without attacking evolution which would conclude as we have all thought previously that creationism cannot be defended or supported on its own merits"

501,"WOW it comes down to this; heterosexuals are given a privledge just because of who they are and who they love. Gay people are denied equal treatment to heterosexuals because of who they are and who they love. The way I understand this is that segregation deined blacks equal treatment to whites because of who they where. You would not deny that the latter is a civil rights issue but you can not bring yourself to see the former is also. Why is that? So what you are saying is that it is ok to discriminate based upon sexual orientation but not race or religion? Why?  When heterosexuality and homosexuality are treated equally and both are considered normal and acceptable then I will move on. There is nothing wrong with being gay, it is not a sin, and it is not immoral. Until being gay is considered equal to being a hetero then you will just have to continue being sick of hearing about it. I am sick of hearing evil funamenalists insult my family because of who we are. I am sick of being denied marriage because of someone elses privledge, and religious beliefs.  Btw this is also the definition of marriage from this site http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage"
502,"And who would pick the 'some'? Perhaps you also believe they should be placed on Ritilin...for their own protection...because their teachers (without medical training) diagnose the infamous ADD demon in them.Not to get off topic too far, some teachers evidently have trouble recognizing the difference between students that can't seem to pay attention and themselves (the teachers) being in dire need of coming across as interesting.What makes you think teachers or parents could ever become adept at recognizing who needs to put on birth control?

According to your logic, any claims that Pluto orbits the sun is pure speculation and will be until 2179.  By the way, we observe evolution all the time. You see, the threory of evolution has to do with how living organisms change through time, not with how the world came about. We have observed the bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics all the time. It is becoming a real problem in that there are some bacteria that are immune to almost every antibiotic we have."

517,"The great majority of abortions happen in the first trimester (over 80%) so you would only be stopping a fairly small percentage of abortions that way. I personally see a reason for putting restrictions on third trimester abortions (since a mind might exist in the fetus) but haven't heard any good arguements yet about second trimester restrictions. What would your reasons be for restricting second trimester abortions?  FYI: In most of Europe, that is how abortion laws stand - available in the first trimester but largely restricted in the second and third, except for certain exceptions. In the UK, it is only third trimester abortions that are restricted. Where US polls are concerned, it seems that they also would agree with you - over 80% of Americans would restrict third trimester abortions, about 2/3rds would restrict second trimester abortions, and about 2/3rds would keep first trimester abortions generally legal (this from a 2003 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll one can find at pollingreport.com)."
518,"Just as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo, so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation, such as a personal God created all that is. We understand science can't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist, but isn't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual which evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding. And ID would insist that it is evolution that's the atheistically motivated pseudo science, so we will continue to disagree there also."

It is one I do not wish on anyone. I hope you know some folks you can trust to guide you and to lean on regardless of your decision.You can still keep it, even though it will be hard, giving life is a wonderful thing.I would suggest that you consider all angles. Talk with those that lead you both ways. Be wary of anyone who just confirms whatever you say. They are not likely giving you sound wisdom but just want you to like them. Pay attention to those that are secure enough in your relationship with them to speak openly and honestly to you. They may confirm your thoughts they may deny them.Good luck.EF"

526,"Hello Aivlis, my name is Joe. Please let me tell you a little about my self. When I was twenty one I started dating my first girlfriend. She was seven years older then me. She had a seven year old little girl. I was working three jobs when we meet (one full time, two part time). Within six months she was pregnant (Yes we were stupid and did not use protection). I went out a bought a ring and proposed to her. She said yes. A short time later she told me she was going to get an abortion. I was devastated. I told her I would open a bank account in her name and have the pay from two of my jobs direct deposited into the account. I told her I would be there for her and our child. She still wanted to get an abortion. I told her I would raise the baby myself and that she would have no obligation, she still wanted to get an abortion. I told her I could not support her in this decision. The night before she went for the abortion, I begged her to reconsider. She would not. I wept like a baby because of this. I took me many years and the mercy and grace of God to heal from this life changing event. If there is anything I can say or do to get you to reconsider this please let me know. There are many people who would love to help you either keep your unborn child or find a safe loving home for him/her. My wife and I have a fifteen month old daughter, her name is Halley Raine. She is a real blessing, but she will never take the place of the child I would have had with my ex girlfriend. My other child would be about ten or eleven now. Please let me know if I can be of any help to you. What ever road you do decide to go down, I will be keeping you in my prayers."

Science is the investigation of natural phenomena through observation, theoretical explanation, and experimentation, or the knowledge produced by such investigation.

The organic materials have been replaced by minerals and they are rock. Ever actually see a fossil? Ever actually hold one?"

531,"III. Reptile to Bird Transitionals  Harpagus bidentatus  IBEROMESORNIS  (pronounces eye-BER-oh-mes-OR-nis) Iberomesornis (meaning  Iberian=Spanish intermediate bird ) was a small, early, toothed bird that lived during the early Cretaceous period. It was capable of powered flight. It had tiny, spiky teeth in its beak and was the size of a sparrow. Its hip was primitive compared to modern birds; its ilium, ischium, and pubis were all parallel and directed backward. Iberomesornis was named by paleontologists Sanz and Bonaparte in 1992. Fossils were found in Spain. The type species is I. romeralli.  ICHTHYORNIS  Ichthyornis (meaning  fish bird ) were 8 inch (20 cm) long, toothed, tern-like, extinct bird that date from the late Cretaceous period. It had a large head and beak. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern birds. It lived in flocks nesting on shorelines, and hunted for fish over the seas. Ichthyornis was originally found in 1872 in Kansas, USA, by a member of paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh's Yale University expedition. Fossils have been found in Kansas and Texas, USA and Alberta, Canada. (Subclass Odontornithes, Order Ichthyornithiformes  HESPORNIS  Hespornis (meaning  western bird ) was an early, flightless bird that lived during the late Cretaceous period. This diving bird was about 3 feet (1 m) long and had webbed feet, a long, toothed beak, and strong legs. Although it couldn't fly, it was probably a strong swimmer and probably lived near coastlines and ate fish. Fossils have been found in North America .  Cuchulainn"

But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants."

539,"I am new to 4forums so I don’t know how to quote very good yet, but that’s not the issue at hand. Again, your example is not an example of the laws of logic because logic is a concept and cannot be observed. Putting your hand in the fire has everything to do with nerves not logic; saying that A then B does not follow because someone could tie your hand (I know people that will burn themselves) in a fire and then A would not equal B, however the laws of logic cannot be violated. Logic cannot come from experience because people's experiences change and are different which means that the laws of logic could change. Logic does not come from your mother's teaching because not everyone has a mother and mothers think differently. Again, if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily. If they are produced from human minds, and human minds are mutually contradictory, then how can the constructs be absolute? Therefore, the laws of logic are not human constructs."

543,"And pro-""choice"" doesn't distort? That alone shows an unreasonable look on the issue.I agree that many are uneducated about the subject (which helps the pro-choicers I might add) and I think many that get an abortion are not educated about whether or not it is morally ok to do. Many have just grown up with it and assumed it to be ok (which neither side of the issue should support...there is nothing wrong with education on an issue)."

But there are many good examples of the population being informed and doing things right. In fact I think typcially, the populace DOES take care of people--I think Americans are generally pretty humanitarian people. That's my opinion.I think the reason there has been resistance to redefine marriage is that people really know that this is not a civil rights issue, despite attempts by the gay lobby to paint it that way. I will say this though: gay people need to be treated as well as anyone else in this country and acts of violence should not be permitted. We should all be able to get along. But that doesn't mean we should have to redefine marriage to do it.As I said, states have the ability to amend their constitution to protect the institution of marriage from redefinition, and 13 states have already done so--many others are working on it. You should probably get used to it. Marriage is just too important to too many people to be redefined so easily."

I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it.

Besides, a selected variation does not mean that it will bode for the best. That is WW's interpretation and value judgment ... in hindsight ... a variation of the view .. twas God's will, He knew what he was doing ... but all you have definitively established is that you yourself looked to the past and infered intent as to the future based on your selective perceptions about what was going on and what feels good. Time and space are muddled. Seems to me that the observer using the more effective scientific method sticks (well) religiously to the present moment.Plus, ""acausal"" doesn’t really mean ""no cause,"" does it?

We don't know what's going on.Random also seems to mean that there are unknown variables or conditions present.Reminds me of discussion re abiogenesis and the term ""spontaneous.""

It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century. It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was, indeed, a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it.I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it."

585,"Nope. Yowm could be day (a in opposed to night - thus only around 12 hours or so), it could be a 24 hour day, it could be days (as in a lifetime), it could be just a general term for ""time"" or a ""period"".

Under that principle, I can write a book and someone can say,  This book makes me angry and hurts my feelings,  and the book would be banned.

601," A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon.   The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.   In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'   The News regrets the error.   CORRECTION"

608,"But why does this generation get to bypass the same authority that every other generation before them submitted to with their parental oversight ? How is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ? Are you suggesting that 13 year old girls are mature enough emotionally to make such adult decisions about getting an abortion ?And if so, do you then also believe that a 13-15 year olds should be allowed to adopt a child ? Or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? Because those are also adult decisions and it doesn't seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decisions about sex or abortions and then insist they're not mature enough to participate in other adult decisions. Kids need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adults and by your way of thinking, you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life."
609,First of all not all Astronomers believe that.All though it is a very long way to the closest star we really don't know how far stars are away from us it is not possible to know. It is an educated guess at best.If you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs?Time and distance are 2 different entities. On the other side of the world it is a diffferent day.A light year is the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have computed it to be on earth. How gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are. Black holes were created to explain the big bang. There are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth.If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen.No one really knows the answer so it is a matter of faith what you decide is true.Both are possible according to science. The powers that be in science are atheist and get the most press. This does not make them right by default.There is a very good book on this subject Starlight and Time if you are interested in what a brilliant scientist who believes in Creation has to say.I will be suprised if you are.I have read Hawkings and have him on audio and video.To be fair you should take some time and study the opposing view IMO.
610,"And the issue of having separate white and black schools, dining rooms and drinking fountains and bus seats, was only about schools, dining rooms, drinking fountains and bus seats. It wasn't an issue about people. Those seats at the back of the bus were just as comfortable as the seats at the front. No need for blacks to complain about being at the back of the bus. They could learn at black schools, and don't have to be in white schools. Blacks could eat just as well in the ""colored"" dining rooms. They didn't have to be at the ""white"" eating counter. Inter-racial marriage was not about black people, even though they were forbidden from marrying a white person, it was about marriage. "
611,"Yes I do. Anytime there's a mass killing, you and your ilk are holding it up as an example of how we need more gun control, how we have to reduce the rights of the people so those that die won't have died in vain.  There's sufficient evidence to point out that strict gun control does nothing to make anybody safer. According to the article nearly 1,700 people have been murdered in the last three years, in a country with the kind of gun control laws that you have the nerve to claim will make people safer. That's over 560 people in a single year, in a country where gun ownership is exceedingly rare and tightly regulated.  A lot of good your desired regulations have done the victims.  So were the officers on the front lines of the Mumbai massacre. But they didn't shoot back, they hid like cowards. They let people get killed for no good reason.  There's a reason there haven't been any recent large scale massacres in America, despite the high levels of gun ownership.  When was the last time 72 officers were killed in America in a single day, in a specific setting?"

616,"Well not to the pro-life league.Remember the Unborn Victims of Violence Act passed by the senate after laci peterson? or as they call it, conners law?The UVVA creates a federal law making it a crime to cause harm to a ""child in utero,"" recognizing everything from a zygote to a fetus as an independent ""victim,"" with legal rights distinct from the woman who has been attacked.""More than 30 states already have similar laws on the books. In practice, these laws treat the pregnant woman as little more than collateral damage in an attack portrayed to the public as one directed against the fetus.""See, this law has nothing to do with prosecuting criminals who attack pregnant woman, it is about turning pregnant women into criminals.Why do i say that? Lynn M. Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women sums it up quite well:*In 1984, South Carolina's Supreme Court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend, causing her, among other things, to lose her pregnancy. In 1997, South Carolina used this law against a pregnant woman, Cornelia Whitner, who was charged with failing ""to provide proper medical care for her unborn child."" Whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug. Based on extrapolation of the state feticide law, Ms. Whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse. At sentencing Ms. Whitner begged for drug treatment. The judge responded, ""I think I'll just let her go to jail.""*Regina McKnight was an indigent 22-year-old woman with a drug problem. She became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term, but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth. The hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment, but rather by helping build a criminal case against her. Eventually she was convicted of murder.The South Carolina Medical Association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that McKnight's drug use caused the stillbirth. Moreover, no one in this case, not even the prosecution, believed that McKnight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy. Had McKnight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion, her sentence would have been two years in jail -- but because of a law similar to the bill President Bush just signed, she is today serving a 12-year sentence.read more here another good article on the matter:Do pregnant woman have rights?*In 1984, for example, a Nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in Chicago was forced to have a C-section. She refused the surgery because she planned to return to Nigeria where she would be unable to access C-sections for future births. The hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure. Hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help.*Another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion. Doctors ""yelled at and forcibly restrained, overpowered and sedated"" the woman in order to carry out the order.*In Washington, DC, doctors sought a court order to force Ayesha Madyun to have a C-section. The doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50-75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically. The court, apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat, said, ""[a]ll that stood between the Madyun fetus and its independent existence, separate from its mother, was put simply, a doctor's scalpel."" With that, the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through Ms. Madyun's flesh, the muscles of her abdominal wall, and her uterus. When the procedure was done, there was no evidence of infection.*Angela Carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill. She, her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible. The hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus. Despite testimony that a Cesarean section could kill Ms. Carder, the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights. As a result, Ms. Carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity; she lost her life. The surgery resulted in the death of both Angela and her fetus.""All of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law.""That line just about sums it up. These laws aren't about saving the unborn, and neither is the pro-life movement. It is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman. It is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception..as if she no longer exists. These people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage...intentional, accidental, whatever."

The evidence you provide to support your case actively harms it. It's not that you're certainly wrong, just that you don't have to be right for the evidence we see to add up. I don't think you're stupid by any means; the skill with which you have manipulated our discussions has been considerable. I do think you are ignorant of much that would beneficially inform your hypotheses, that you cherry-pick just that evidence which seems to support your preconceptions rather than critically applying your hypothesis to all the available evidence, and I do think that your intellect is being leveraged in pursuit of the wrong goal, namely the creation of a fortress of semantics, idiosyncratic terminology and untestable assertions from within which you can hurl abuse at others.You may disagree with my assessment - fine.

647,"I linked to a post that sufficiently validates my point. If you want to discuss in more detail the broader implications of current abortion policy, I would be happy to do so.We can start with your suggestion that abortions are illegal after the first trimester. That suggestion, while common, is not correct. 12% of abortions in the United States occur after the first trimester of pregnancy. That's an estimated total of about 154,800 abortions in 2002.And besides that, you miss the point. The point I tried to advance is that people who are avidly pro-choice typically do not see any circumstances under which they would restrict abortions save for (in some instances) the third trimester. Thus, they would defend a woman's decision to obtain an abortion for the sole reason that she fears that the child will be one gender rather than the other.It also would be interesting to know (since you felt the need to weight in) whether you support abortions performed solely for the purpose of gender selection?"

Its not that I do not like your examples, they are simply not analogous. A human life dosn't begin and end in nice neat ways: even when your brain dies, your fingernails keep growing for example."
660,So you admit there is NO scientific evidence of any theory of creation. Thanks.
661,95% of all abortions are done as a means of birth control (CDC statistic).  898 abortions were conducted in south dakota in 2000  Worldwide since 1973 4000 abortions per day have been conducted.  That is a lot of babies.  EF
662,"Really? Liver, kidney, prostate, uterus, pancreas? Can you please support that for me?The rest of your post is sheer, meaningless stupidity. Only XXXXXX and creationists claim that evolution implies some sort of ""step up."" The reason is the neither is capable of understanding the basics.Do you actually think that the pile of XXXX that you posted has anything to do with evolutionary theory? Perhaps if you had the integrity to actually learn the basics of what you claim to oppose you would not make yourself look so foolish. It is pathetic."
663,"So reading and literature aren't to be taught?I love it. More stupid, paranoid parents for me to mock mock mock. They are sooo part of a great big problem. A problem that sees my kid getting threatened and bullied - so I feel totally justified in my mocking. Frankly, there are days I would like to kick them in the teeth."
664,Oh they think they can Doc! They think that we gun owners are the terrorist!   Personally. I think that all of this talk about Gun Control is happening because they are mad. They are MAD that a Black Man! Is in the White House!
665,"Hello there,  Your ignorance is showing concerning both history and anthropology.  We Neanderthals were the first humans to recognize the existence of the soul and the afterlife. We were the first to bury our beloved dead with personal articles, still valuable and quite usable to the living, but because they belonged to those we loved, we buried such items with them.  You obviously were never taught that and never sharp enough to learn for yourself, but hey, that's nothing new from someone from the Left.  Symbol over substance is your mantra and shall no doubt, so remain.  Cheers from the Rockies"
666,Actually Archie it was neither left nor right. he went after both democrat and republican and took a center tone to the entire issue at hand. Portraying the reality of the suffering of his hometown due to jobs leaving the US and the greed on wall street.

670,"And here you are, claiming that judge Urbina ruled favorably to either Heller or for the side of the Second Amendment Rights? He did not! He tried to muddy the water and preserve the status quo of the failed D.C. gun laws."
671,That question is ignorant. Why would any evolutionary biologist make such a stupid claim? Do you actually think that by implying that such stupidity is a claim of evolutionary biology you are somehow showing that it is wrong? You don't seem to be able to actually offer any facts that refute evolutionary theory so I guess it is necessary to resort to nonsense in hopes that the stupid will believe you.
672,"And I have left them feedback to see what happens. I noticed this particular entry was sourced from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition so it is not something Dictionary.com wrote.  I can see Iuris' point but the entry is still laid out wrong if this is the case. As written,  Godlessness; immorality , implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym. I think this is because some use the term  godless , an adjective, to mean immoral but  godlessness , a noun, to mean atheistic."
673,"There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction.  As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the  Son of God  and the  Son of Man , which means  Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.  I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.  Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws."
674,How many children have you adopted?
675,"This should read: The theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth: Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws, which can be rationally explained by one process only  I add this because your theory of evolution, which you just posit as here as the only theory, is but one of many."

679,"Again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. As if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.  What a sad and mean little man you are."
680,Nonsense. Almost a billion people are nonreligious.
681,I'm fairly sure he wants to blame them for deliberately turning a blind eye so that they can't identify the guilty dealers - for the sake of profits and deniability.
682,"Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the ""ancients"" commenting on subjects you thought science had ""discovered"" since the ""enlightenment""? Man, how arrogant can you get? You remind me of the Pharasees. Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend. Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above, or don't bother posting."
683,Hypocrisy at its highest. The Civil War was fought to establish the principle that each person owns his own body - a principle that the pro-life crowd is trying to destroy.
684,"There are in place control procedures for traveling with weapons. All he should be charged with, and I expect he will before this is tried in court is breaking the Airport procedures, or maybe they are FAA procedures which could imply Federal laws.  This guy should have contacted the Airport at check in to report each and every weapon he was traveling with. They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on. FAA News"
685,"I'm always interested in arguments where 'image' assumes physical likeness. When God said, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness...', I wonder why God needs five fingers, two eyes, a heart, liver etc. He's supposed to be a spirit and therefore has no need of physical characterisitics. Easily understood when man created his own god.  But what if 'image' refers to character and personality, not physical appearance? Man really is like his god in that case: murderous, jealous, petty, genocidal, caring, loving, contrary et al. Like father, like son.  Character-wise, man has probably always been the same to some extent or other."
686,"Oh but you forgot the rest of my secret plan. Just like Hitler, first you take the guns, then you send them to 'jail'. A jail with 'showers' and 'ovens'.The most important part of the plan is make sure anti-gunners don't have guns. Which ofcourse is not a problem."
687,An agnostic believes gods cannot be logically known (ie require faith). One can believe in the Christian god at the same time.
688,"The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.  Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK."
689,"Well first off, again, you asked a misleading question. Jesus didn't just happen in the last century, nor in the last decade. Besides, God Rapes an unmarried Jew and gets away with a violent crime?!?And people wonder why I'm such a skeptic.I've never bought the whole ""emaculate conception"" jazz to begin with."
690,"I don't care what medical standards are, having a bacterial infection doesn't mean that you have actual culture on your side.  What's really going on is a war of opinions and beliefs. On one side you have the group that believes in individual rights and freedoms, and on the other you have those believe that, since no right is absolute in scope, that's the green light to go ahead and attempt to restrict and infringe on anything and everything they can, through any method available to them."
691,"That happens, too. For example, our gene for vitamin C is broken and no longer works."
692,"I thought the critical factors were (are);  a: When does a child's life begin?  b: When does a new child's rights begin?  c: What are the possible justifications for denying the rights of the new child (if any)?  d: What (if any) should the punishment be for violating the child's rights by killing him or her unjustly?  Can we not (at least) agree on what the  critical factors  are?  If not, isn't all subsequent debate destined to be non-productive?"
693,"first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations...and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them."
694,"Why is it that evolution cant be considered as a mythical tale?. A tale of how soup turned into a human being , and that has no evidence for all the major links for this story to work!...."

696,"oh because for the past decade or so they have been indoctrinated into hating alleged liberal activities (let's ignore the fact that without liberalism there would be no USA!)Extreme enviromentalism is nuts. Extreme industry is nuts. To be sane and happy, there must be a middle ground."
697,I believe Sinjin is right. Children are citizens once they are born. Citizens are naturalized or natural born.
698,Who cares?
699,"Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce."
700,"We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models."

703,I think if you man guns criminals will just keep using guns. Production of illegal firearms in Britain is apparently through the roof. They are converting starting pistols and  non firing  replicas into regular weapons.  Trying to prevent criminal use of firearms by making firearms illegal is stupid. Idiotic. I cannot even think of astrong enough word to describe the stupidity of that moronic mindset.

708,Can't argue with this illogic.
709,"You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving..."
710,Your lie about me is duly noted.
711,"And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically (read: deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with (for example) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time) in order to work.  I can't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards."
712,"Do you have a quote? a link? anything to make us think that you're not spinning this like you tend to spin everything else?Here's something you didn't think through: you say that ""inherent"" human dignity is a derivative of the image-of-God claim. First, that makes it most certainly not inherent but derived. Second, you insult the entire human race when you claim that human dignity is dependent upon anything else. I'm sorry that you think so little of humans."
713,"You are welcome to your faith, and you can use it to believe whatever you like, but this continuing misconception of yours that (on the subject of evolution) we're exchanging beliefs and opinions of equal merit can only be counterproductive. Evidence inevitably weighs in, and apart from a single chapter in a single book all of it is landing on my side. Either the whole world is lying to me, or that one chapter is allegorical, misinterpreted or just plain wrong. It does not require faith, bias or belief to be convinced when the evidence is overwhelming. You proudly proclaim you have the faith, the bias, necessary - that's fine; as I said you're welcome to it. But don't make the mistake of assuming everyone forms their opinions the same way."
714,"So basically, you're saying you know they have a legal criteria for what constitutes civil rights, and in the same section you say you aren't a lawyer, and that you can't track it down. Interesting. Since you aren't backing it up and essentially admit that you can't, then your claim will be taken for what little it's worth."
715,"He was guilty of blasphemy, the evidence is sooo clear he did not resist any of it he knew it was right in order to save us. This applies to modern day death penalty becuase when Jesus died for us he was accused of a crime. And now the death penalty kills people that have been accused of a crime."
716,Because they're judged to be derivative of the branch that led to us rather than the branches that led to the other apes.
717,I knew that already.
718,"No, it certainly doesn't. It has the Book of Genesis, which isn't  backing  because its the story itself. Every other mythological analogue has equal (i.e. none whatsoever)  historical backing,  but you're specially pleading for your personal preference."
719,Just amazing.
720,"That's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species."
721,Students become confused when the school curriculum implies that what their parents taught them is wrong.
722,"And wrong again. Hypotheses become theories once  enough scientists reproduce the same results repeatedl  as you crudely phrase it. Laws deal with tiny parts of the theory that can be expressed in simple mathematical terms. Natural selection is in it's basic form a law. But there is masses more to it than a simple law, so it gets to be a theory. Theories are the pinacle of achievement in science: they are, in simple laymen's terms, fact."
723,"Because you asked me to quote your lies. I did. Not only can you not find whichever source you claim speaks of birds' infrared vision, you apparently can't find any source that does so. Despite this, you've been whining about how visible and UV camouflage must be moot because of birds IR vision.And to top it off, rather than admit to your mistaken memory, you're blaming the imaginary source:"
724,"How about: A woman wakes up to find herself connected to a body. A body without a brain, which is using her own organs to be alive. Doctors are preparing to transplant a brain from a dying violinist into this new one connected to her and the date is set in the future. Would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity, mind, consciousness or existence in actuality?"
725,"And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world."
726,"You must be joking. I'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane.  Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US? If what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the US, but we don't."
727,"Oh, well I'm not saying that companies won't be paying more money in health insurance. My point is that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really change company policy. The company's policy is currently based on the government's definition of marriage. If the government simply allows more people to choose to classify themselves as married, the company may see more more married couples apply for jobs, and it may see more of its employees decide to become married. As it sees these things happening, it can feel free to change its policies as it sees fit. What I mean is that this ruling would not mandate the businesses to make any payments to facillitate a change; all that would happen is a few more of its employees might begin to classify themselves as married and it might be a bit more likely that the company hires in a married person. There is no mandate sent out to the company, there is no change in company policy, and there is no payment that the company is dishing out. If as more married people show up in the workplace, the company decides to change its health care coverage, that is up to the company, but it is not mandated to make any change.Now maybe you can still classify this as an unfunded mandate, but I'm not really so sure that it legally qualifies under the circumstances. Regardless, I've been saying that its status as an unfunded mandate is irrelevant in determining whether it is right to agree with same-sex marriage or not; the fact that companies might have to provide all couples with health care equally instead of only giving health care to couples based on the sex of those involved is a change worth making. Quite a few companies already do it, in fact."
728,"Well, the first part is true but I'm not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part. Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept. ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science (and logic for that matter). ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence. Science has better explanations."

730,"I believe you, OTHERS pick and choose what you believe. What is sad is how many lose their faith when they find how much they have been mislead."
731,They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?
732,just curious...what do you do for a living?
733,"its still not a bilateral relation. all living thing manifest energy, but not all things that manifest energy are alive. its easy to turn on your car ignition and make the engine run, heat up, generate electricty and make noise, all from the chemical energy in the gasoline. Still the car isnt alive. on the other hand, in the living body, energy is constantly being converted from chemical to other forms, and the moment energy stops transferring, the body is dead. the relationship between life and energy exists, but it still doesnt conclude that life is energy"
734,And that just scares me.
735,"Considering your previous comment, that isn't you. Once again, that opinion is based upon who you read."
736,"Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment."
737,And that is why Bible thumpers are so dangerous. The have so little self respect and so little respect for others that they need the thread of eternal punishment to keep them in check. Thank God for the Bible to frighten you into honorable behavior.
738,"Actually the Bible has changed, not to mention had omissions."
739,But they can't be true christians if they accept evolution.
740,"To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more ""preposterous""."
741,"But what you are being challenged to do is to give some evidence for the idea that the world was created less than 10,000 years ago.  In other words, ""If Genesis-style creation were true, we would expect to see (fill in the blank)."""
742,"Well, here is my take on it. I really believe that only the truly evil end up in Hell. Those like Hitler. I think that anyone else goes to heaven - Wiccans, Atheists, Buddhists, etc. - anyone who follows Christ's message of love, tolerance, and acceptance, whether knowingly or not.  Those who preach hate, and those who act on that hate, like Hitler, the KKK, and any other person/persons filled with hate (sad to say, this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here) are the ones who will end up in hell."
743,"That doesn't work, sorry. The speed of light through space is constant, that's why a light year can be used as a measure of distance."
744,Yet there is evidence aganist Bush and you have a double standard on applying your attacks on Kerry to Bush even when the same circumstances apply.
745,Whether the steps of evolution have been observed is unrelated to whether evolution complies with the Scientific Method. The scientific method is used to provide evidence for a hypothesis by perform a study that could disprove that hypothesis. Evolution has passed every scientific test that could disprove it to date.
746,"We all know of course that the partial birth abortion procedure is never medically necessary to save the life of the mother.Now, you seem to believe that men are just trying to endager women.

748,"Because you've presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals.  If you can't prove it's broken, you don't have grounds to call for fixing it."
749,"No, no. It was all my fault. I was praying that she find peace, and my mother-in-law is a priest so I've got an in with God.  I guess Jesus figured that all believers would want, and pray for, the same thing. Oops."
750,"This statement almost defines pathetic. Anyone who requires the gov't to validate who they call family, or who they love and share their life with really needs to get their priorities sorted out."
751,"I can't help but wonder if current majority public sentiment against alternative lifestyles, and other change, isn't a portion of widespread fear as that public experiences declines in standards of living, an ongoing threat of Islamic extremist attacks and other social changes that further threaten their status quo. Change is not something eagerly embraced by a majority of the general public under normal circumstances, actually quite the opposite, and these trying times would increase their desire to hold established values representing better times in a higher light than if times were prosperous and stable. Most arguments against alternative lifestyles that I've read are mythological belief system based and present more of a position against the unknown, adherence to parameters established by that belief system, than any disruption of society. Sort of a 'no atheists in foxholes' wartime crowd mentality as versus live and let live if a change presents no threat to the individual (believer) in better times."
752,Without their tools they could not do their job to the stringent safety standards both those careers demand. Thats reason for you..... they still didn't need any  faith  to get to that.
753,A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to  win  an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of  reasoning  has the following form:  1. Topic A is under discussion.  2. Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when  topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).  3. Topic A is abandoned.

756,"So you were unable to see evidence of erosion in the pictures that I showed you? By the way, the fossils are not bone - they are rock. They are a different kind of rock that the sedimentary rock in which they are found. Perhaps if you actually educated yourself you would know that the fossils are usually much harder than the surounding sediment. Of course, anyone who made an effort to learn before speaking would know that."
757,"I already did explain the obnoxious childs dishonesty accipiter. You really need to read the posts before embarrassing yourself asking ridiculous questions. The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums, much less this ONE.You notice that this liar never actually supported his claim that I ever ARGUED THAT GOD IS AN EPIC LIAR!!! But that never stopped him from making the dishonest claim, did it? So my question for you is this; why would you even rely on such a liar to make any type of valid point at all when he isn't even connected to reality which he proves in every single post in which he corrupts and perverts what another member says by completely misinterpreting what he says?"
758,"Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!  I don't see why we should care how many weapons couldn't be traced back to America even though they came across the border, because it's a moot point. The identifying marks don't exist on them if they can't be traced, meaning the whole thing is a non-issue for everybody except those who have an axe to grind and rights to try and destroy."
759,"The effects are not remotely similar.  Marijuana is not an effective pain reliever. It is commonly prescribed to treat nervous disorders and nausea.  They don't. The vast majority of users(not addicts) are functioning citizens. The fact that you don't know that proves the point.  This is old and tired. The only gateway is the dealer who is encouraged to carry multiple products. That and the fact that many young people figure that if they were lied to about the seriousness of dangers associated with marijuana, maybe those other drugs aren't as bad as they say either. Wonderful strategy on the part of the antis.  Except no one smokes 20-40 joints a day."

763,"Bush has flip flopped just as much as Kerry. As for records, there is next to nothing showing that Bush actually showed up and did anything for the Guard."

767,"I'm not going to even mention how perilous common sense is. I'm confused by your statements about all animals having brains and consiousness. Your first assirtion is wrong because some organisms, like sponges and jellyfish, do not require a centralized nervous system. Your second assertion is nonesensical and incorrect according to classic Christion dogma. You have no definition for consiousness so potentially even plants have some, making your assertion meaningless. Animals would all have enough consiousness to do what they needed to fill their niche, and this would be caused by slow natural selection, not by holy edict. By the way, most pastors I'm familiar with would tell you animals don't go to heaven because they are both soulless and lack conscious thought. As to you stating God gave animals the ability to change to their environment, do you have evidence of massive bodily changes? Tell your assertion to the millions upon millions of species that have gone extint in Earth's history because of changing enviroments or more powerful competition."

I mean only sociopaths feel no guilt when sinning, are you saying that you're a sociopath?  What's a ZEF?

SS: 2) Show me one instance of science testing/disproving lamarckian-style inheritance."
776,"You quoted the article, which said what the OPPONENTS of gay marriage were saying.  Why should the AG waste time creating ballot titles for initiatives that may never get enough signatures to even get on the ballot?  You GET the signatures so that you can get ON the ballot in the first place.  Do YOU think that?  Did they make ANY explicit condemnation of the AG for failing to give something? No.  Did they seek any lawsuits to make the AG give them something he was required to? No.  It makes no sense for the AG to waste his time running around naming ballot initiatives that DO NOT HAVE THE SIGNATURES to even be put on the ballot.  The logical sequence is that the initiative proponents present the necessary signatures to get on the ballot.  THEN he gives it a ballot title.  Why give a  ballot title  to something that doesn't have enough signatures to be put on the ballot?  Opponents say they are dropping their efforts to qualify the repeal initiatives for this fall's ballot because neither has received a state-approved ballot title and the deadline for turning in signatures is only a few weeks away -- July 3rd.[/quote]  Archie, the other thing about this is WHY would you stop your signature drive just because you don't have a title?  They could continue to get signatures while they pressure the AG for a ballot name, if that were a legitimate avenue.  The fact that they have dropped out SO PREMATURELY should tell you something, if you bothered to try to think about it."
777,So I am correct about my asserations as to your education?  Still you completely fail to argue the merits of creationism without attacking evolution which would conclude as we have all thought previously that creationism cannot be defended or supported on its own merits

780,"Actually, it did affect the judiciary. One of the judges on the 3 judge panel that decided Emerson used a quote and source from that book. He later went back and edited it out.

783,"Yes, because congresses powers are actually pretty limited. It hink it will be interesting to see how the 2 upcoming supreme court cases (one has already been accepted, the other is pretty much a shoe in) regarding the commerce clause will be handled, since the majority of the laws that congress passes are tied to it."
784,"I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.  Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation."
785,"You both missed the most common anti-evolution assertion:  And again, a creationist shows the belief that if you don't agree with them, you're an atheist."

789,"I admit I didn't know who Sermonti was at first. A search on Wikipedia returned Ciacco, one of the characters of the Divine Comedy by Dante. a Google search led me to Giuseppe Sermonti who has written against evolution since 1980. He is known for expressing the need for 'purpose' to be part of science, giving such examples as: ""In the presence of the inducer (lactose) the cell produces an enzyme with the purpose of utilizing lactose4)."" In case you never took biochemistry, this is an incredibly well understood chemical process and requires no purpose beyond the interaction of well understood chemicals."

793,"And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate."
794,"Just a guess on my part. But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc.Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane. And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is.He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims. (i.e. These cases go on for years and years and years and years. There's no closure for people.)"

Intra-species evolution and inter-species evolution are one and the same?*edit*I was reading on micro-evolution in wikipedia, here is what they had to say...is this incorrect?""Typically, observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics. Because microevolution can be observed directly, both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life."""

800,"Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you ""allow"" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!"
801,"I think reason why the ""hypothesis validated"" card has been played here is because:1. The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected ""transitional"" form.3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated ;)I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled."

803,And many of the questions that creationists ask.
804,"There is some belief within the scientific community that neanderthals cross-bred with sapiens to produce modern-day caucasian Europeans. This explains the big nose, wider head, etc.  ... How could that possibly be racism?"
805,"so people you dont know deserve to die? The point is that they are people. You are a person that is not well known. If you died, and someone that didn't know you saw your story on the news, they might not care, but you still matter don't you."

807,"Just about any phrase you want can come up with a bible code, right? Is there a program out there than looks for specific phrases with gaps ??  It should be possible to use the bible codes to prove that Intelligent Design is a fake, right .. some phrase like.  Intelligent design is fraud  and  William Demski is a con artist , or something similar. That would be amusing."
808,"Yeah, but everything that creationists can't deny is claimed to fit the Biblical picture. Please cite the verses. How could all of this tectonic activity have happened in just a few few years after the mythical flood? You do know that it produces heat, don't you?"
809,"If the justification for morality is obedience to a divine authority, it has no place in a public school. Those without religious beliefs are not by definition immoral."

813,"So this list was a surprise to you? This isn't the first time that the  challange to come up with one scientist who believed that humans do not share common ancestry with apes  has come up on these forums. When refuted, the goal posts move, and it's shown how several scientists who don't believe in common ancestry are dwarfed by percentages of those who do, with of course, a dose of ridicule thrown in. Is that how students are sometimes  educated  in today's universities? A false implication is made to belittle creation as much as possible, and if not questioned, is quickly built upon? And if questioned, the goalposts are moved and the questioner is riduculed?"
814,Really? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers. There is no hype about Miller/Urey. It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities.

817,i didnt make any statements. i asked you to kindly explain the relationship between the existence of god and te existence of logic. you are claiming that logic can only exist because god created logic. please explain
818,"The bible is evidence. Its existence is a fact. What that fact represents is subject to interpretation. Ken's argument is that choosing to believe the bible is infallible is no more or less of a presupposition than choosing to believe that logic is infallible. He's right in absolute terms, but those axioms are not equally congruent with reality."
819,We don't need to know how life arose to study what has apparently happened since.
820,"the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the ""greatest possible being"". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. ""greatest"" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that existits like ""the oldest man alive"". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence"
821,"So you know what Ozzy was trying to say in his pointless statement? How do you know your interpretation is correct while mine is wrong? How exactly do you justify taking the word of a man who bit the head off of a bat, as something credible?"
822,Non-violence is a non-answer.
823,Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.
824,"But does not evolution say that there can be NO difference in kind, simply differences in degree? Evolution does not allow for something of another  kind.  If chimps are of a different kind, as well as humans, then evolution still falls."
825,"So,are you saying that all anti-gunners are fearless??? If so,,I must laugh."
826,"If you believe that it is the development of thinking ability that makes a human count as a life with rights, it seems reasonable to think that people with superior thinking ability would have superior rights."
827,"No, its not. Thats a strawman. I have never stated anything of the sort. You just cannot debate honestly. I never said that since one argument is wrong, that all are wrong. I am saying that I can prove all the arguments wrong independantly. Not that I have to.  Now, any of you able to give even a hint of an intelligent answer to the OP? Or does that shatter your delusion that you dont support murdering children?"
828,I think the reason for the differences in translations is because the translations i think are geared more to audience. There are easier translations for little kids and those who have a hard time with bigger words. Another thing that has to be taken into account is that it is not always easy to translate exactly from one language to another. Some English words have several equivalents in other languages so the differences in the translations come from which equivalent was chosen by the translators.  P.S. This of course is not to argue with what the person stated above.
829,Oh really? <snicker>  Then why don't you:  1) explain exactly how my second statement is wrong  and  2) how the rest of your post was not an attempt to explain how you wrongly believed my statement to be wrong  Here is your entire post:
830,"OK. Evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the knowable. It's by that definition, rational. The entire theory, as is all knowledge, is subject to evidence, not being self-contradictory (as your statements often are), and not contradicting some other validated knowledge. Evolution meets these requirements, and is therefore entirely rational. Anything else?"
831,"Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore."
832,"Let's take this slowly...  a) Montalban is asked to give a definition of unknowables, and does so  Mach: It's illogical, merely defining it doesn't prove it exists.  b) Mach is asked to show a scientific test for dark  Mach: Look I don't have a scientific test for dark, but I can prove it exists by giving a definition of it!  Once again you defy yourself! So, merely defining 'darkness' does not prove it exists BY SCIENCE. What you have done is to confirm that it can't be defined BY SCIENCE.  SHOW ME THE SCIENCE THAT DEFINES DARKNESS. If you can't then we have evidence for a suggestion that something exists (in nature) that science can't test for."

835,"Well, its not just morally wrong in America, but its morally wrong in the middle east as well. And i think that if we continue our way downward morally as a nation, it would give terrorists even more hate for america because we are supposedly a  christian nation  and dont live morally.  anyways."
836,"Anyone trained and able to exhibit demonstrable knowledge in it's proper usage and safety, with no demonstrated history of mental illness or violent criminal behavior."
837,And terrorists probably kill less people in the US than non terrorists. To even begin to make any kind of meaningful comparison you have to adjust for the fact that there are a lot more people who don't pack heat than those that do in the US.
838,"The roots of gun control in America have racist roots. Clayton Cramer, a black Georgetown University Economics professor, wrote an excellent brief documenting the Racist Roots of gun control for the Heller case.

I know some on the Anti side will claim that this group is too radical, but yesterday's shooting only highlights the reasoning?s for why they are so adamant about NOT being disarmed.  They are truly being targeted!   No Guns for Negroes"
839,"Well, the type of atheism you are talking about here requires faith.If you say ""I know there is no god,"" this statement requires faith.You have not observed anything that would lead you to reason or deduce that there must not be a god. The presence of religion has nothing to do with this faith and it's not a religion, just a gross assumption with no ""proof."""
840,"Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating ""reorientation therapies"" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero."

What you describe is one small step for evolution, you just have to repeat this 1,000,000 times over various other environmental and competitive contraints and viola, you'll probably see evolution at work on a scale that you can recognize.You're almost there montalban!-Mach"
847,"This isn't even remotely true. Two people can go to a church and marry without the permission of government, or not go to a church, they can go out in the woods and shout  I'm married . I don't know about you, but the government doesn't determine who I'm married too. What the government can do, subject to the will of the people, is decide which marriages it will recognize.  And upon what grounds do you base this claim? Government chooses not to recognize different types of marriages all the time, not just same sex marriages ie. polygamist marriages, relatives, age limits, etc. These recognitions are not only federal but vary state to state, for instance some states recognize 1st cousin marriages while others don't, as I recall, the age of consent to marry also differs among states.  While I agree that civil rights should not be up for vote, you have not given evidence that gov't recognition of marriage is a civil right."
848,"I have yet to see any conclusive evidence that this is true and undeniable.You wanna prove in an undeniable manner that developed nations around the world have fewer deaths than America? Then get cracking and gather the evidence. Start proving that the various governments around the world aren't lying about their annual death rates. The UK has been found guilty of continuously altering statistics to make themselves look safer than they really are.So do you have any proof that the annual number of deaths of a country like Germany, are the true number and not some government sponsored, people's friendly statement to make people feel less afraid?"

858,"It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. ""Macro"" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different."

If it is a child, then no matter what, the child must survive, becuase it has every right to. If the fetus isn't a child, then we can do whatever the hell we wnat with it. But it's a child, since humans only produce children, and not being of other speices, in accordance to the Principle of Biogenesis. Therefore, abortion is wrong in all cases."

We knew that by pressing the button, the bomb would be dropped and people would die.Compare that to the manufacturers. They make products that people use in their daily lifes.

We are well aware that the environment can cause mutations under many conditions (cosmic radiation, x-ray, etc.). What is denied is that mutations are environmentally directed - in other words, exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation. The mutations will be random.On the other hand, natural selection IS, by definition, the response of populations to their environment. The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA, i.e., the genome of the population."
871,Nope not kidding. Matter has a CONTINUUM of complexity. At some point in that CONTINUUM we assign (in a rather imprecise way) the property of Life to the matter concerned. Other less complex matter is assigned the abstract property dead or non-living. If you were more familar with the true range of complexity which matter exhibits you would be aware that the division is rather arbitrary. For example people have much difficulty on agreeing on whether viruses are living or non-living matter. And its clear that while you cannot analyze complexity in matter that it does exist. Its there and its real and its a lot more real than simple taxonomic categories like lfe and non-life are.
872,"We agree that there certainly is a problem, correct?  Could it be video games, movies, or developmental issues, or??  Before we debate thoes topics, lets examine the same issue in the U.K.  Are video games in the UK? Yes.  Are violent movies in the UK? Yes.  Are there bad bad parents / psychopaths / nuts in the UK? Yes.  Are handguns legal in the UK? NO  Does the UK have shooting rampages as often as the USA? NO  Are video games in the USA? Yes.  Are violent movies in the USA? Yes.  Are there bad parents / psychopaths / nuts in the USA? Yes.  Are hanguns legal in the USA? YES  Does the USA have shooting rampages more often then the UK? YES  It dosn't take a genius to find a correlation between handguns being legal and shooting rampages.  I agree that guns are not the problem in and of themselves, but humans are the problem; and humans wield guns.  Clearly, handguns should be illegal."
873,"You couldn't make an association like this to save your life. Hitler gained power by deception much like what is happening now. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (google it) puts to rest any claim you have made about Hitler. He did disarm Jews, Gypsies and others he was afraid of because they did not support him. He also had some weird features you share like torturing and burning helpless creatures! People cannot be tyrannical by definition. Check it out! Your claim is dismissed for want of cause and no true stated claim."
874,"And yet, in this case, your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage. And you aren't outraged by that? That's what I don't understand. The article focused on Palin 'needing to clarify', but didn't even take Biden to task for being against gay marriage!"
875,"Actually no, Duo has not. If you had ever bothered to read any previous posts by Duo in THIS forum you would ALREADY know he explained this assertation multiple times.  You are once again making assumptions."

880,"So that no girl, underage or otherwise, refuses to seek treatment for fear of what their parents will think or say. If a girl cannot be tested for a STD without parental notification and she does not wish her parents to know she had sex (or fears their wrath), she may not go in for testing.  In general, knowing whether you have a STD is a good thing."
881,"I do not believe it. The sources cited by the pro-freedom movement are footnoted INDEPENDENT studies..  Your link states: An analysis conducted by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence   This was biased and faked at best.... Show me..... DC Survey says! XXX Show me.... Baltimore!!!, Survey says! XXX!  They don't give links to thier data (pro-freedom sites do), They don't even break it down by state!  This whole campaign is based on an emotional response of Brady's wife...

882,"Just think, without Christianity and its preservation of science during the Dark Ages, we lost out on the opportunity to reinvent the wheel. emoticon_rolleyes  That has got to go down as one of the dumbest things that I've ever read on this forum."
883,Genesis 1:27 is a summary of Genesis 2:21-23
884,Obviously the correct thing to do is kill the zygote. The thing that bothers me about this whole thing is some of the people that said they would refuse to choose. This is characteristic of your typical wimpy religious copout and is nothing but a cheep avoidance tactic. These people are not the kind of people that should be making any important decisions that concern other people so I guess it’s just as well. A zygote is no more viable then a sperm. The attempt to call a zygote a living being is simply more evidence that the religious have no common sense.
885,"Actually, if you know what you are talking about even a quick glance will tell you that you are wrong. Of course, paleoanthropologists who study such fossils do more than take a quick glance at it."
886,"If I'm so pathetic why don't you start debating my on my OP here. by the way, I could care less what evolutionists think of my posting habits. Come to think of it I may go find another board to post on."

888,"No, you are mistaken. Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time."
889,"Foolish Clergymen.  How can this work? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart.  You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs. It simply must be all or nothing. Otherwise you are wasting your time."
890,Nope mutations happen to individual cells. And hypermutation takes place and appears to be controlled at the level of individual cells also. You need to stick to the facts here.
891,NO ONE HAS TO HAVE A GUN! The point is is that the choice should be up to the individual. If a criminal thinks you are armed he will move on (or he has a death wish)
892,"Ready to go, in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? ."
893,"No, you believe we have a human responsibility to the government. There is a huge difference between charity and the government threatening people with jail or death if they don't hand over their wallets."
894,"And here ladies and gentlemen we have the evidence of why I am justified in calling the likes of ""stormboy"" an idiot. The guy tries to discuss science when he is so utterly lacking in basic science that he thinks that the earth spins to ""keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun""... emoticonXBangheadstormboy, there is a thing called gravity: it is what ""keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun"". Now please go away and get an education, then when you have even the faintest idea of what you are talking about (which you currently do not), come back and attempt to debate. It will be for your own good as you are just making yourself look a prat by staying here."
895,"Actually, your argument makes no sense. It's not the pesticides used on the tobacco crop that makes it harmful, it's the chemicals they add to the tobacco to make the smoke more palatable. Your whole point here is moot."
896,"You're obviously an Obama supporter, they're the only people who wouldn't be upset at his abusive tactics of threatening lawsuits against anyone that runs unfavorable ads against him, thus showing that he doesn't support the First Amendment."
897,"You may not have intended to, but you've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes, with regards to her family - and you'd stick out of it, regardless.Also, interestingly, there's no man in this 'idealy free' family of yours."
898,"They say: don't say this incorrect statement, say this other one instead! Wow, the ""information"" thing will never cease to kill me."
899,"It was a fair question for Tim to ask, even your beloved NRA web-site has the 2nd Amendment located in top-right. (http://www.nraila.com/issues/FactSheets/)  How does the law of contract explicitly protect your right to carry a gun?  Are you allowed to shoot someone if they breach a contract?  What about torts laws? - where a contract doesn't exist."
900,"Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's. emoticonXGood"
901,"So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?"
902,"This is a false assertion. In our society, a woman is not obligated to care for a child after it is born, this is why adoption and safe-haven laws exist. The situation is different enough between a fetus and a born child that a direct moral comparison is impossible in this way."
903,"Because they are unable to maintain a pregnancy - money, job and education security, health (physical, mental and emotional). I do feel that more open adotion would help. A lot of women can't go through the pregnancy and then just have the baby disappear into the wild blue unknown."

906,You are right. Jyoshu doesn't get it.
907,"Nice spin by way of projection but you are wrong as usual. I find your defination of your position to be too funny. Like it is some how wrong to turn the tables on the left by using their methods. You still fail to address the fact of liberal firearm owners. Or is the fact of owning a firearm enough to have one drummed out of the liberal camp, buttons ripped off and sword broken?"
908,"But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being."
909,"But what is adultery?  Mark 10:11:  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.  Matthew 19:9:  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance. According to Mark, all putting away is adultery, but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him. Which is it?"
910,"Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread)."
911,"I'll address the later question. They may not  need  teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't  useful , they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case."
912,"Yes I do. Anytime there's a mass killing, you and your ilk are holding it up as an example of how we need more gun control, how we have to reduce the rights of the people so those that die won't have died in vain.  There's sufficient evidence to point out that strict gun control does nothing to make anybody safer. According to the article nearly 1,700 people have been murdered in the last three years, in a country with the kind of gun control laws that you have the nerve to claim will make people safer. That's over 560 people in a single year, in a country where gun ownership is exceedingly rare and tightly regulated.  A lot of good your desired regulations have done the victims.  So were the officers on the front lines of the Mumbai massacre. But they didn't shoot back, they hid like cowards. They let people get killed for no good reason.  There's a reason there haven't been any recent large scale massacres in America, despite the high levels of gun ownership.  When was the last time 72 officers were killed in America in a single day, in a specific setting?"
913,"It is horribly oppressive of women, though, to oppose both abortion and contraceptives. That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all."
914,"Half of all firearms-related deaths are suicides. Out of the remaining 11 to 15 thousand deaths, the vast majority are the results of police shootings or gang wars. Neither of these are linked to widespread legal gun ownership, nor can they be curtailed with evermore laws. Only a fool would believe more laws against guns will affect gang members."
915,"Actually, the one chanting the equivalent of mantras is yourself. I have debated a plenty on single payer, posting resources/cites to back up my arguments. While I do not see you using either (a) reasoned argument, with the additional (b) cited sources to establish any factual assertions in your argument.  So go jump in a lake, Steeeeeve."
916,Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.
917,That is what it said. Now your website gives a false translation to this. It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed.Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say. Religioustolerance.org is a joke that misleads people into making God what they want him to be.
918,"Again???? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens (i.e. black) from owning guns... Liberal terms such as ""saturday night special"" all have racist undertones. Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority... Who are these laws meant to target?"
919,"And Jon Wiener says in his book that was because John Lott was protected by the gun lobby.  As I understand, Cook and Ludwig were the researchers who found that gun violence costs society $100 Billion a year. What do you hope to prove with mudslinging? I could say- The anarchists and rednecks keep us laughing."
920,"And of course, you'd need to elaborate. Like exactly what about one version of God makes more sense than any other."
921,"**Like chemist and all other darwinists, you imply wherever possible. But in this case I broke my own best rule and replied to chemist, and was not speaking of you at all.And you are right, the phenomenon of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, [inexplicable in darwinist mechanical terms], as discovered by Cairns, et al, in 1988, is a separate phenomenon from stress-stimulated somatic hyper-mutation. I misled you in the the quote you used to bring in the Cairns work--"" Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.""That was not Cairns, but Barry G. Hall to whom I was referring, and he was a research prof at U. Rochester in the 90's who did work on adaptive mutation, wrt adaptive cellular responses in stressed eusocial bacteria colonies. That is, somatic hypermutation as a cellular,[in multi-cellular organisms, such as eubacteria colonies], adaptive, systemic and systematic [non-randon, non-stochastic, non-accidental] heuristic evolutionary mechanism.He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria."
922,"Because no new information is added to the genome? Well, it's wrong, but interesting.It didn't change whether I thought you were nuts."
923,"Oh, I hear you. I am covered by my partner's insurance here as well. I would not have been able to get the insurance if we were not legally a union. It's amazing. And I am REALLY greatful for that!"
924,"Actually, I think that lack of support for your mythology is one of the reasons that it isn't accepted as literal. I suspect that your documentation is just assertion that you believe because it tells you what you want to hear.  Why is it that creationists keep claining to have  proof  and never present any? Have you checked out the threads in the Religion forum where some posters are having trouble demonstrating the historicity of Jesus? How can you claim documentation for Adam &amp; Eve, the Garden, talking snake, the flood?"
925,"Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals."
926,I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?
927,What a load.

Nothing major, this shouldn't be part of the debate, just a definition of the term. A google search for that term gets 2 results, both the same theology forum.  And to the judges/moderator, if this type of request is out of line then please simply delete this post. I'll make my request for a definition in my next post. But I feel it's in the best interests of this debate to allow me this post for simply requesting a definition and him a post for simply pasting a definition.  Thanks."
929,"OMG. Here we go again.  Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. What theory of law would you use to support your point?  Hypothetical situation: Roe is overturned, returning control over abortion to the states. State  A  bans abortions; state  B  permits them under most circumstances.  1. What sanction does State  A  put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders? Upon whom is the sanction applied? The woman? The doctor?  2. How does state  A  prevent its citizens from traveling to state  B  to have the abortion performed?  3. How will state  A  determine that one of its citizens has traveled to state  B  to have the abortion performed?  4. Can state  A  punish one of its citizens for traveling to state  B  to have a legal act performed on her?  5. By what claim of right is any man entitled to an opinion on the question?  After you finish those, Joel, I have a few more for you."

934,"Question is what sort of punishment would you have for adultery if there was an amendment? Financial, already their in divorce. Are you going to lock adulterer up?"
935,Well it gives us more indication as to the mode of life of Archaeopteryx as an early bird and more common structural features with small theropods that are suggested as the ancestral stock from which birds evolved. It is worth noting that both Velociraptor and Troodon lived a long time after Archaeopteryx; the suggestion here is all three had a common ancestor from which similar features were inherited.
936,"The Simone persona is not capable of serious thought. Let alone debate. Ad homs, personal attack and spin is what it thinks is debate. The exchange here should tell you all you need to know about this persona."
937,"Well, we do, actually. That is why we send the woman for numerous OB checks throughout the pregnancy."
938,"Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.  IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes."

950,"Creationists need to latch on to the intellectual integrity of science. They know that if they can represent their claims as ""scientific"", many people who otherwise would ignore them will pay attention to their incredible claims.To put it crudely, the creationists seek a ride on the science bandwagon."
951,"I don't know anyone on the committees, but people I know who have taken a look at the initial proposal and understand the current Oregon public health program (manages Medicaid and other fed/state health funds) say it's financially feasible by the proposal to combine current private policy subscriptions (including civil service at all levels other than federal) and fed/state/muni contributions. I'm told the key will be deductibles and how they scale them.Oregon's schools (excluding rural designations) would have plenty of money if educator unions didn't have funding in a stranglehold. Word is that unless benefits and retirement now equaling private sector CEO levels aren't cut back the system will crash within the next decade. Off-topic, but civil service pay and benefits are an upcoming US crisis. Unions have switched from ruining manufacturing industries to the public sector. The county I live in already has a dual work force, union and non-union, with union workers to eventually disappear by attrition. Maybe sooner when looking at budget forecasting."
952,"and i can ask the same dumb question back to you.  what if it is really true?  the question was not aimed at whether G-d exists or not or whether religion is true or not. it was a comparitive religion based question, so if you dont believe in the premise, why are you posting in the thread?"
953,"The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life."

957,"yes, and i suppose an idea of perfection can exist, in a thinker's mind, and subjective to the thinker's standards of perfection. i could also point out that an imperfect thinker, with no reference or standard of ""objective"" perfection, is incapable of having a perfect idea of anything. therefore the argument falls apart at the first premise, since an ""idea of perfection"" cannot exist, unless the thinker himself is perfect, which would make him God by his own definition."
958,"Just so we're clear here, your idea of ""proving your point"" that I'm dishonest is to call me dishonest.  Yeah, not quite how it works outside of Archie-land. Sorry."
959,"Well, given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist's mind, I suppose you're right. Evolutionists don't actually exist. Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them, including dishonesty. Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion. The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea. A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it. They then declare it is wrong and by proxy, the actual theory wrong. It's fundementally weak, but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound. "

965,"'Self-awareness' is not a strictly objective, scientific term. I recall reading in my college psychology textbooks that the concept labeled 'self-awareness' doesn't happen until many months after birth. At the end of the day, in order to answer the question, I think you'd need a pretty solid definition of self-awareness, and coming to agreement on what 'self-awareness' is or should be may not be an easy task.In a strictly biological sense, there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization. There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact. Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness' and 'personhood,' etc. come into play can there be valid debates. Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization, and I'll show you a semantics game. ;) It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life' begins with recordable brain activity (as early as 40-days post-conception)... or 'self-awareness' or any other such concept, or when the entity would be 'viable' outside the womb. But there are varying levels of brain activity. There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness. And viability is an ever-changing concept (a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota, and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news).If we look to biology to answer the question of when a unique entity begins its biological development that will not end until it 'dies,' then the answer is conception/fertilization."
966,What purpose does that serve with NCIS checks?
967,"Halton Arp is far from suppressed.  Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.  And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.  I'd say that if he is  suppressed  then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his  fireworks  universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this.  But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these  weird  redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away. The ones that can't are just curiosities. Then there isn't a systematic way to look for these things, so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching, which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time."
968,"Why don't you take your own advice?What would it take to change YOUR mind on abortion?BTW, this, 'I said.

978,"According to history. I see you litterally ignored how it was wrong when one looks at how blacks were treated. How does it not? Blacks were paid less because they were black, Black soldiers weren't sent to fight because they were black. Black officers couldn't even command moderate level units. Black soldiers were treated as slaves when captured and often executed, not even afforded the rights of captured white northern soldiers. In fact it went so far as if a White officer in command of a black unit was captured, he was executed because he commanded a black unit. White officers captured from white units were treated as prisoners. White soldiers who didn't even speak english recruited off immigrantion ships from Europe were paid the normal amount. White soldiers were sent to fight, not sent to dig fortifications or ditches or latrines. Blacks were not treated equally in any way during the war, and reconstroction period in the north and the south shows a stark contrast in a belief of unequal creation. I suggest you go back and learn something about the war before talking about it.  "

983,"Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5% of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95%, which is better than nothing. After that they can work towards stopping all abortions. It's a step-by-step process. I say abortion of all kinds should be illegal. 95% of abortions are a result of consentual sex. We shouldn't cater to the 5% just because they've had a tough situation. I sympathize with them and would do what I could to help them, but they do still need to have the baby, whether they give it up for adoption or not. This isn't a horribly unreasonable position. It's just a difficult position. Saying it's alright to kill a baby for any reason is a horribly unreasonable position.People need to face the facts too. Sex isn't there for pleasure, it's there for procreation and happens to be pleasureable. Someone who indulges in this pleasure should be ready to deal with the outcome, which oftentimes is a baby."

995,"I believe the Bible is correct in every detail. The difference is how those who read them choose to interpret their meaning. You, for instance, look at a verse that says the earth cannot be moved and take that to mean that the Bible says that the earth does not move PERIOD. I believe that that means that God is powerful enough to keep the earth from simply ""flying out"" of its orbit and rocketing off into space somewhere. Yes, I proudly ""cling"" to the idea that a flood covered the mountains. I believe fully in the ENTIRE Bible (unlike some people) and I DO NOT ""pick and choose"" what I believe."

1000,"I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions."

What is important was the composition of the ore back then. Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.468E+9 years and U-235 has a half-life of 7.038E+8 years, it is apparent that the U-235 decays much more rapidly. It stands to reason that the The relative percentage of U-235 to U-238 was higher in the past. It also stands to reason that thee was more uranimum present at the time that the natural reactors were active. About 2 billion years ago the U-235 was about 3% or more of the composition of the uranium."

Registration of ownership and the reporting of private sales would shut down the illegal traffic in firearms and empower local jurisdictions to enforce their local rules and regulations.

They could learn at black schools, and don't have to be in white schools. Blacks could eat just as well in the  colored  dining rooms. They didn't have to be at the  white  eating counter.

The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,  Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.  Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him  that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,  particularly on abortion.  Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop - Yahoo! News  Yes! Now do that with the rest of the Biblically-challenged, spiritually-inept Kennedy family, and all the rest of the pro-abortion Catholic democrats."

But leave marriage to the churches."
1045,"Your obvious ignorance of medical procedure is astonishing. I do not think any such uninformed person has a right to an opinion, but since you have decided you do, let me try to inform you. A doctor would never ""stick a pair of scissors"" into a baby's head. Any propaganda that has told you otherwise is just that, propaganda. If the doctor is ""holding in his hands"" a baby about to be born, (which implies labor) and that child weighs more than 500 grams (just under two pounds), he is required by law to do all in his power to protect and support that child's life. Partial-birth abortion is done only in a case when the mother's life is at stake, no, it does not always ""save the mother's life"" in some cases it is done as a prophylaxis against an event in which life-saving measures would be deemed neccessary. Example- the mother has advanced liver disease, when she concieved it seemed as though it would be possible to carry the child, but as her pregnancy advanced, so did her disease, so that now she is in complete renal failure. The doctors advise her that if she continues with her pregnancy, she is putting her own life and that of ther child into jeopardy. He urges her to abort the child, in order to save her life. This is one case where a partial-birth abortion would be the method.If the woman decides to continue her pregnancy, she might die, the child might die as well. But if she chooses not to have the child, she lives to fight another day. Tough choices- What right on earth would I have to enter into this situation and tell her that ""god says you gotta put your life at risk and carry this child, even though both of you might die""????I may be sick, but I pride myself on the ability to create an informed opinion on a matter, and until I am informed, I keep my opinions to myself.That should be in the bible somewhere"

Did it stop the US?Secondly, the specific example given; that of Japan, is a nonsense.

1056,"And who is it @1790 that said the right of the people to bear arms ONLY related to active duty militia members? It makes little sense to argure ambiguity and precision at the same time, but that is what Cornell does. His argument is internally inconsistent in that in an effort to undermine the standard model, he argues that there was no agreement on what the RKBA meant, but then he proposes a narrow/exclusive right which would reguire more, not less, precision -though he can not cite even one person from that time articulating such a narrow right. Why would one assume that the civics rights model, which demands exclusivity, is to be favored over the standard model which does not ? Note that the standard model encompasses a right to keep and bear arms for one's own defense as well as to contribute to the common defense so is consistent with various statements from that time (i.e. see Bryan's non-exhaustive list of citations from that era). However the civic rights model proposed by Cornell does not fit with what was said by J.Wilson, R,Sherman, and other framers."

The Bible is true without error.Certainly people who have bee indoctrinated to believe that ""GODDIDIT"" will believe that question. They have been taught that it is a sin to question revealed truth, and revealed truth is revealed by ""ministers"" who are scientifically illiterate.Why does creationism seem to be a matter of the views of those who are becoming rich from the stupidity of the Christins masses.In the mean time, the U.S. is now a second rate country, where our universities are manned by an increasing number of foreign professors. I don't have a problem with foreign professors except that there are no qualified U.S. citizens out there. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the leadership of U.S. universities is due to the influx of foreign professors. They get paid more here than in their own country, and of course, they are more qualified than U.S. applicants for their positions.I wonder if our universities will be able to maintain leadership in the world of academia when the entire upper echelon is overtaken by better educated and more qualified foreigners.In fact: Japan has about half the population of the U.S. and graduates about twice the number of students with degrees in science and engineering.Isn't it wonderful that we are debating the pseudoscience of creationism and ID in our school boards?

1066,"Thank you for your reply kelvin90701.I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon, for now, I am just leaving, so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post. Specifically, the following:The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.So, what you are saying, is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons. That is, it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns? If so, would it still be OK, for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere, etc?Again, thank you for your response.-Dan"

By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint."

Either King ABC lied in that story and therefore doesn't never lie, or King ABC really doesn't ever lie and in fact didn't lie in that part. You can't have it both ways, but the Bible tries to have it multiple ways all the time. Even if you and I both think that the King ABC story is fiction, we can recognize this inconsistency and have absolutely no reason to believe that the story is nonfiction.  Later you accuse me of having double standards. This is ripe considering the above."

1101,My point was that just because an animal has features that resemble different animals doesn't mean it has evolved from them.
1102,"Actually the Bible/creation makes quite a lot predictions that science has recently verified. Some examples include: that the Earth is round (Isa. 40:22); the Earth is suspended in space without support (Job 26:7); sea currents; the hydrologic cycle; the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa 51:6); and the fact that Orion cluster is seperating and that the Pleadies cluster is staying together as a group (Job 38:31); and many others. Since there was a global flood according to the Bible, we would expect there to be many fossils rapidly despoited and this is what we see in some parts of the fossil record. For example, there are some fossil beds are found in sedimentary rock, deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while still giving birth and eating food. Creationists have also made predictions such as the fact that there can be variation with in a kind, but one kind cannot change into other kinds. This is what we observe now in the present, and is backed up by the fossil record. We would expect that many rocks, such as Uluru in Australia, would not be ""ordered in layers"". Once again, this is what we observe. Creationists predicted that mutations and natural selection are down hill processes, i.e. information losing. We would also expect everything to be running down, we might also expect to know that some dinosaurs survived the flood but most likely died in the ice age that followed the flood. Several cultural groups have given very descriptive information about dinosaur like creatures. Remember, they would not have had a picture book with dinosaurs in it, the Aboriginal's for example, had paintings of dinosaur like creatures in caves; the amazing amount of design and complexity in the universe; Laws of Nature. Also many other predictions. So as you can see, creationists have made many predictions (as has the Bible) and all are 100% scientificly correct. IF, if such fossils are found and they are obviously transitional, then that would certainly aid the evolutionist case. But evolution is supposed to have millions of transitional fossils, they have a hand full of highly debatable ones.Btw, I am not trying to impress you by any means of your imagination. If I wanted to impress someone I could stay here and away from the internet. It is just that ""evolution"" is not as ""scientific"" as you may think."

1105,Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?
1106,"All I know is Obama and Biden both have a bad history of voting agains law abiding gun owners, if they are given a gun ban bill to sign, they will almost certainly sign it."
1107,"Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.  The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child."

1115,"So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.  What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.  The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence."
1116,"Well, you've told me you do not believe, literally, in the book of genesis. God didn't create the world in six days, the earth and the rest of the universe are actually billions of years old, etc.  But I assume you do believe, literally, in the ten commandments? That they are really the words of god?  Why the dichotomy? How can you write the creation story of as something to interpret as you wish, but the ten commandments are solid and correct?"
1117,"No, it certainly doesn't. It has the Book of Genesis, which isn't ""backing"" because its the story itself. Every other mythological analogue has equal (i.e. none whatsoever) ""historical backing,"" but you're specially pleading for your personal preference."
1118,"There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction.  As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the  Son of God  and the  Son of Man , which means  Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.  I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.  Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws."

1120,You need help pal. joke or not you need help.
1121,"Well, ok. You're right. Now that I think about it, ""missing links"" and ""transitional fossils"" aren't really the same thing.All species are potentially transitional, in that if the line continues it will change eventually, maybe even split.But missing links are something different.It's just a fossil that shows some relationship between other fossils and that's really all."
1122,"But what would he have learned from it? If you're going to use that analogy, then lets say the last thing he remembers is walking to the bar. What would he learn or have experienced?"
1123,"Just a newly-evolved structure. It happens.  That's always a shock to newbies. If you think that's all there is to it, you must be homozygous for the gullibility allele.  It's true. You don't have a  nose gene  for example. Rather your nose is the result of a number of different genes, the physical forces that shape all organisms, and perhaps other things like nutrition.  This was very well examined about 100 years ago by D'Arcy Thompson, in On Growth and Form. More recently, some of this was examined by Stephen Vogel in Life's Devices. Worth learning about.  There's a lot more to this than you imagine.  Barbarian observes:  ...In fact, as the article pointed out, the particular group of lizards to which this new population belongs, does not have cecal valves.  .  Getting bigger is hardly the same thing as evolving a new structure. But there isn't a  tall gene  that works in exclusion to everything else, either.  Random mutation and natural selection. It works very well, as you see.  Just common sense. If a mutation provides some benefit, it tends to be retained. Over time, (sometimes over a very short time) this can produce a new structure as we see in this case."

And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court."

1129,"An abortion is an abortion. Your emotional use of the word  euthanasia  is pointless and irrelevant. Either you object to abortion or you don't. Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash.  I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion).  Don't like it? ... TOUGH!  And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself."

I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important.  For both the 'braniac  case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't.

The moment you invoke the supernatural as a reason for a natural event is when the science has stopped- for example intelligent design will go some way with the empirical and then flip to the supernatural at the last hurdle. ID would say this is the eye, its structure has evolved through organism x->y->z we see in the fossil record and then say God directly shaped this design as it is too complex to have happened by chance, whereas science will say the eye was a response to a natural evolutionary pressure say from predation, environment and so on and is a product of natural selection.

1171,Actually true. But I fail to understand the point. mtDNA from Neandertals seems to indicate that they are not ancestral and did not interbreed with modern humans. Neither are mammoths ancestral to modern elephants. In both cases the evidence indicates that they are related species. What was your point?
1172,"So you think that, if murders were legal, there would still be the same number?  How about robberies, or rapes? There are plenty of those, the law can't be having any effect...  In short, I'm saying that making anything illegal reduces that thing. Criminalising murder results in less murder, criminalising drugs leads to reduced supply of drugs (compare any drug with nicotine, or alcohol), and criminalising guns would lead to a similar reduction."

1180,"I was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion. Liberals don't give a damn about individual freedom; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life. They want gov't control of healthcare because they think we're too dumb to fend for ourselves. They want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they don't trust parents to be parents. The list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless.  And I have no problem with gays, just their attempts to redefine marriage."

1182,"It isn't possible to tell. What is called the  scientific  approach is to analyse social statistics to derive probabilities, a methodology which assumes that the present is the same as the past, all well and good for the physical sciences, where the way particles behave does not change, but inappropriate in application to complex systems like people, that may react in ways totally unanticipated.  Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems, but the more ways you try to manipulate them, the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes.  So what do you do then, just take this method anyway, even given you can't predict the results, just take your best shot? When it fails, just say  oops, well, we had good intentions, we can't be blamed . If that's all we have to work with, we are truly screwed. There are however, alternative ways of deciding whether you should do something to trying to predict its outcome."

It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records, such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb (MNSU n.d.; Watson 2001). Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently, yielding consistent results. Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques (e.g., Bard et al. 1990)."
1187,"You seem to think that any time someone is killed, the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator ""devalued human life"". If that was the case, gun manufacturers, car manufacturers, breweries, and cigarette manufacturers would ""devalue human life"" simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse. And the government would ""devalue human life"" by letting these companies operate under it. We do not go targeting innocent civilians. More often than not, the civilians are killed by Iraqi suicide bombers or ""militia"", and the few that are killed by the US are accidents."
1188,Just wondering if you are going to respond to the OP (as it was addressed to you to help you to understand something).  If you ask me I'd just ignore the negative comments that some posters make toward you. Just focus onexplanations of misunderstandings and constructive criticism.
1189,"Aside from this being completly wrong, it is quite compelling. You make a good point in regard to an organism's form only making sense in relation to its environment. Of course, this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment. It actually is possible to look at genes without the context of the orginal creature. This is why we can move genes from one organism and place them in another. Given a complete understanding of molecular biology, we could contruct any form of organism we desired from scratch."

1193,"In a way, taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. For instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights. Here are just a small number that come to mind:1) Right to murder2) Right to own slaves3) Right to rape4) Right to abusing children5) Right to vote6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)8) Right to engage in certain activities in public9) Right to drive as fast as one wants10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest riverThe list goes on really. The fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. That is quite inconsistent.Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway?"
1194,"Except that we have a known causal link between human activity, greenhouse gases and temperature change. There is also the rate of increase that is unusual. If temperatures had risen over the last 10,000 years as quickly as they're rising now, the sea would pretty much have boiled.  As for the allegation that environmentalists are in this for the money, how many multi-millionaire environmental campaigners are there? How much do you think the director of Greenpeace makes?

Who knows, he may even be able to find a cure for stupid."
1196,"Yes it does, by the definition of existence. We can't determine whether something exists or not if we do not define  existence.  I define it like this:  If something exists, then it can be detected.  If something cannot be detected, then it doesn't exist.  Note that the converses are not necessarily true.  Theists define  God  as something that cannot be detected. Therefore, their god does not exist. Pantheists define  God  as the universe. Polytheists define their gods as superhumans who live on top of mountains. This proof cannot disprove pantheism or polytheism, but it disproves theism."
1197,"Well this doesn't matter. It would have to be free for the US to afford it. In fact, look for the UK to have troubles affording it as their debt pushes 100% of GDP like the US."

1202,"Well, man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as DNA from scratch. Of course, he would use the knowledge gained from studying how various DNA codes affect natural biological characteristics in order to properly design that DNA to achieve the desired characteristics. It might be even more difficult to then take that synthesized DNA and put it in an egg and artificial womb that has no natural (as opposed to artificial) biological parts, but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction. All this means is that humanity might someday be able to copy the methods of nature to create a new being - perhaps even use creativity to create beings of very different natural functions than we see in our world.It is all interesting to think about and could well be achievable within this century. We already are capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization. One would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technologies get developed.The other question, of course, is - If we could someday create new life using our technology, should we? That would bring up a whole host of issues, including:- Would we know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm?- How would the beings we create be treated?"

Why must the anti-abortion crowd use such fallacious images to sell their point?"
1208,"Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I don't agree with this. I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena, only speculations as to what (if anything) may have happened before the Big Bang.

1210,"You guys know me. Always happy to correct anyone.As electrolyte pointed out, (1) the first step in the scientific method is the observation. A scientist observes something that raises a question. (2) Then comes the hypothesis, that is an attempt to explain the observation. The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition, or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles. (3) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis. That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics. In the case of the scientific method, the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, if the prediction can be shown to be false, then the hypothesis must also be false. If the prediction is true, then the hypothesis is supported. So now we have the observation, the hypothesis that explains the observation, and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis. The next step (4) is to design an experiment to test the prediction, and then (5) to perform the test. If the prediction fails the test, then it may be abandoned. However, as electrolyte pointed out, the process may be circular, because if the prediction is falsified, additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at (2), and a new prediction is made at (3), and so on.In creation science, the process stops at (2), except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture, not reality."

People don't molest or rape because they are so turned on they can't help themselves, they do it to HURT somebody.Get some information before shooting off at the mouth VOR. Most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles. I HATE IT - when people spread this ****. It is FALSE information that does nothing but HARM.

Exactly what kind of qualifications are you going by in declaring a nation  developed  if the government is unable to protect you, and they've actually made it a crime to try and protect yourself during your time of need?"
1221,"Here you're just flagrantly wrong. For info on the link between dinosaurs and birds, as an example, please follow this link and see the excellent post by pandion on this topic. And before we address the Big Bang, I should point out that the validity of that theory really has nothing to do with evolution. As for proof of it, we have the expanding universe around us, and the theory also predicts the same levels of cosmic background radiation that we actually see everywhere. Could there be other explanations? Possibly. But the Big Bang is still the best we've got. "
1222,Only an atheist is arrogant enough to presume to question why God decided to do that.The greatest scientist in history said about the order of the universe:The Author of the system must have found it convenient.Birds did not evolve one either. They were created with it up an running.
1223,"Oh. You just lost me. The fact is, Jesus warned his followers that they would be persecuted for his sake. Read Matthew 10:5-42, if you care for the full text. Basically he told them they would be beaten, thrown in prison, crucified, and put to death if they followed him. And that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for Christ as Lord and Savior. The various Roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every Christian they could find, men, women, and children. Christians were crucified by the thousands, covered in pitch, and sit afire to provide light for the emporer’s lavish garden parties. They were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways. They were called martyrs, which now means one who dies for a cause. The word is Greek and means “witness”. These witnesses for Christ were killed for their faith. How many Christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith? In spite of everything that the emperor did, they could not kill the Christians fast enough. More were believing in Christ every day, and eventually even the Roman emperor himself became a Christian and Christianity was embraced and sanctioned."
1224,"Well,  evidence  for an extraterrestrial creation isn't just through visions and people who have  seen  UFO's.  You forget  evidence  given by astronomes such as the people from SETI. (SETI is an organization founded after scientists have discovered a strange signal from outer-space. From there on the organization has developed very much)  The signal, the SETI people got showed the first three prime numbers. This is very strange because it has never happened before (the scientist who detected the signal, called it WOW-signal, because it was so strange)  This signal shows a major part of Design: Specification  But unfortunately, to show that it is really true, it is missing another part: Complexity  The signal is evidence, but unfortunately it is too short. If those scientists would detect a signal that shows the prime numbers from 2 to 101 it would meet both parts: it has specification and complexity...  The SETI people would party all night...  So these  theories  aren't as unproven as you think they are...  (I still don't believe it happened like that)"

They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue."

Retail establichments are able to decide fro themselves what they carry, the governemtn has no place in such decisions.

What materialism has done, under a long series of name changes, [the last being 'naturalism', if I'm not mistaken], has been to desperately rationalize the evidence of actual reality in the form of 'forces' and other phenomena antithetical to its principles and assumptions by pretending that what it says isn't what it means. For example that its denial of all things immaterial and incorporeal and insubstantial doesn't apply to forces, mass, energy, and so on. All very darwinian SOP."

They went to the Sheriffs Dept and took warrants on me and my mother. My wife got my mom for assault claiming she was trying to grab our daughter from her and was fighting with her. Yet again no marks.I even have evidence of premeditated revenge from threatening text messages days earlier from her dad and her saying stuff on myspace. She took out orders of protection on us but the judge dismissed them QUICK! We got indicted so now we're facing a plea hearing. The other judge made us take joint custody. Primary custody has yet been asigned. My lawyer is the best in the area and also a good friend of mine. He's trying to get it dropped before court. But they claim I just touched my Glock.

1255,"[quote]this fact alone dispells the notion that we?re in the process of increasing in complexity, as darwinists insist [/Quote}  Darwinists insist on no such thing. Complexity can come and go in evolution. For example free living organisms with complex structure can become parasites with minimum structure and greatly reduced complexity. For an explanation of what complexity can be defined as see the Adami paper.  Prove it!  Before laying out the various relationships perhaps you should prove your initial assertion and key assumption that  the mind and mental processes are in control of the genome  I would be most interested in how you can control your own genes. Can you change your eye color at will for example??? WOW.  Yes it is the follower, it binds information about an organisms environemnt into the genome. It may (but need not) follow the changing fitness landscape which is only static for limited periods.  Basically you have conflated the external environment with the mind. An odd error but still one you have made. Once more read ADAMI!"

1257,"Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful. HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the ""lots more"". Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next."

It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage."
1263,"Your logic is that if no one was there to witness it, it therefore did not happen.

The entire argument based around the witness via your argument is worthless."

So called Assault Weapons even if were dis-invented would have less impact than lets say murders committed by beating people to death with hands, and feet. Which by the way, also shows the futility of banning guns in the first place. Brady,  I have shown you who commits murder.  You are NEVER going to stop all of that by punishing those who don't take drugs, or sell them, or commit crimes. If you were actually serious about doing what you say you want to do, you would be designing and pushing for resolutions to deal with the actual evidence.

1266,So how do you propose that communication in one instance over a network differs from communication over a network in the other. If for example I tell you that there exists a network and that communication takes place over it can you tell me if that indicates intelligence or not?And how do you propose to PROVE that only living things CAN be intelligent? What evidence would suffice? Clearly according to you communication over a network is NOT sufficient proof!What you have in fact done is to claim that all living things are intelligent and that communication is not evidence of that intelligence. So if communication is not adequate to demonstrate intelligence what criterion do you use? Frankly I think you have no criterion in mind other than a system being what you call alive - itself a vague and difficult to pin down category! Are viruses intelligent or not?

No matter what happens to an organism, you will always be able to say it happened on purpose.The observations you cherry-pick are those you use when attempting to prove that darwinian evolution cannot work. So you ignore the countless studies where variation is unambiguously stochastic and focus on the very small number which seemed initially to show non-random mutation. You ignore the countless studies where adaptive mutations arise, and can be elevated by carcinogens, in the absence of any hypermutational organismic response, and focus only on those where it does occur."

They have the right to free speech even free speech, I or anyone else diagrees with. This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech. With freedom comes responsiblity. The law suit for pain and suffering, I think is just.  Oh so many law suits to plan. Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity.

Over 60% of permit applications are denied, and penalties for posession of an unlicensed weapon are severe. YET, unlicensed weapons outnumber licensed ones.  The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element. Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal. They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway. Nobody is going to decide NOT to murder somebody because they fear being charged with illegal posession of a firearm.  Gun laws essentially only apply to law abiding citizens.

1309,"Can't agree about the current state of American education. Since most Nobel Laureates are in their 50's and 60's, these statistics indicate that as of about 35-40 years ago, the US education system was in good shape. We'll have to wait and see if the situation is the same in another 40 years to assess the current situation.  And of course the US will have more Nobel prizes; as one of the more populous developed countries there will naturally be a larger pool of humanity from which to pull."

1312,"Actually NDS does not have to imagine the mechanism involved they actually know the mechanism. By the fact of their being alive (which is in fact the ""life-struggle"") they acquire (as a population) mutations. Some of those mutations aid them in their ""life-struggle"" and thus become more likely to appear in the succeeding generation. Thus the succeeding generations have a slightly different memory of the past than their predecessors. And thats that; the author clearly does not grasp the means by which complexity emerges in biological systems. Once more Adami is applicable here. And I have to add that the mechanisms of mutation, selection, and inheritance are well established at the molecular level, at the micro-cytological level, at the nuclear level, at the cellular level, at the organisimal level, and at the population and ecological levels. EAMs only riposte to that large empirical base is - to invoke mysterious and unknown and undemonstrated mechanisms which have no basis in fact. Sorry but the EAM hypothesis does not fly any better than a solid lead balloon."
1313,"If I argue that all babies should be killed, and you don't think all babies should be killed, does that mean that all babies aren't really babies? No, it means that you think my reasoning is unjustified. Think about that for a second, then re-read the claim."

But there are some quite good examples in the fossil record. The horse and the whale are two. And the dinosaur to bird line is getting better all the time."
1315,"Anti-gunners don't care. They want ALL the guns not matter what is historically correct. Men who lived during the birth of this country were made of a much different metal than liberal anti-gunners today. What once considered a persons responsibility and own personal domain has been superceeded for  collective good  and what is  benefit to society . Never mind that democracy is fragile and that the majority of all living humans past and present has lived not as free men. Never mind that that those lessons and hard won freedoms are traded away for the convience of state care and protection. Yes horrific crimes are commited with firearms, but they are commited by evil men. Good and evil can be equally acomplished by a firearm. Never mind that evil men commit evil acts and good men can do good with the same firearm. What matters most to anti-gunners is that the evil and the good should be punished together for the common good of society."
1316," He  is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality.

1317,"No, the ""life ex nihilo"" doctrine of YE also denies God's word in Genesis."
1318,"Well, two things here1) No one has ever said that Evolution asserted that we know everthing about complexity. 2) The discovery institue, which publishes that list, basicallyi gave a poll out, then after responses, changed the wording of it. Basically, it's a lie."

1320,"How elegant. Yes science is the way to understanding the physical world, and faith is the manifestation of our spiritual selves. But when you say this among sci-only people, it is immediately misconstrued. Most sci people won't even read that sentence objectively. Say the word ""spirit"" and suddenly you are changed into a fundamentalist, inbred, uneducated, dimwit who wouldn't know Planck's constant if it hit you in the head.Life is much more than a series of reactions. It is cool that we are able to reduce it down so much. The benefits of science are vast. But there just seems that there is more than meets the eye. I'm curious."

1322,"I do - because he, by his own admission, does not understand/comprehend technical science and so relies on the purposefully dumbed-down press releases that he links to and quotes.

Or am I wrong?"
1324,"Well I replied to this same post a couple months ago, but I would like to respond with a new perspective I have on it now.Basically the basics of the US government is that it is to secure our rights and our safety, so that we don't live in a state of anarchy, where the biggest strongest man wins. If a power isn't given to the government, they may not use it. The bill of rights is an even further prohibition of regulation. To make a law based on firearms or anything they have to have a reason for doing it, and the federal government may not be involved unless the Constitution grants them the right to (it doesn't mention guns in the powers it gives the US government). The 2nd amendment is restricting the government (federal, states, and local governments) from infringing upon that right. But the question still arises, what is meant by the mysterious militia clause?There are many interpreations on this but I think the basic meaning of this is so that a similar thing could happen as did in the American revolution. But then an even bigger problem arises. If that purpose is to be left intact we need to allow the citizens to access the same weapons the government has. But I really don't feel comfortable allowing citizens with atomic bombs and such. This is really a problem. Also, obviously if this were meant to be a tool for a revolution, wouldn't concealed weapons also be covered? Again it seems that it is currently impossible to follow the intentions of the amendment.Many will use the quote ""Those that sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither"", but this is a hollow argument. The whole purpose of government is that we give up some of our natural liberties (the liberty to kill someone) for personal safety and protection of our other rights (the right to life). I agree you cannot go too far, but where do we draw the line? I don't like the idea of an oppressive government owning all the weapons or do I want them available to the worst criminals, so that instead of handguns and regular bombs, they are using uzies and atomic bombs? Do you have more trust in the government or in the general public? That's a hard question to answer because I don't have much trust in either one, therefor I seem to be undecided on where to really draw the line. As you can see, my opinion on this matter has changed drastically over the past few months, mostly because of this site (see, ideas really can change minds :)), so please don't tell me how I'm contradicting myself here."
1325,SO we are sticking with the now defamed  collective right theory  As of yet you have not explained:  How the people in the 2nd amendment differ from the people in the other amendments.  why the government would put a bill of rights that pertained to  the people  in all the other amendments but somehow saw the need to write one for themselves in the 2nd.  Ill keep it to 2 for now
1326,"Huh, what is more important?  The constant messages of acceptance, tolerance and love in the bible, far too numerous to count  OR  The few and far inbetween (what tops 3?) vague passages possibly about homosexuality.  I used to go to church and my pastor (a woman by the way) kept stressing that the important things in the bible are the ones that are repeated time and time again.  Obviously the UCC understands this but many people here don't."
1327,Exactly so.  Pro-choice people would not impose their values on anyone; profetallifers would impose theirs on every woman of child bearing age.
1328,"No, 35 of 3500 is 1%. But what's your point? If a poll is conducted in the US in which 350 people identify as being democrat then comparing 350 to the total population of America would not be a sound statistical method to determine the percentage of the American population that is democrat.   However, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms , and Explosives (ATF) reports that 30 percent of guns involved in federal illegal gun trafficking investigations are connected to gun shows.   Gun Show Undercover: The Investigation"
1329,"Sounds like the same skeptic argument above. I don't know about you Nu Leader, but when I'm certain my mind exists. Are you not certain? You are actually required to be, to deny you exist would require existence, and that would be logically contradictory."

1331,So it has gone from an indeterminate (based on my quick searches) number of fewer isoforms in lower vertebrates to the 24 found in mammals. That's an increase in information.
1332,"I wasn't oversimplifying anything, only stating the obvious in that a whack job intent on murdering people can do it very effectively without a gun. But by disarming honest people as you would do, you insure that criminals who have no respect for the law will remain the only people armed in our society once the law abiding people willingly give theirs up. That will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can't prevent crime from occurring as it's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings.  You anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men. If you look at the rates of violent crimes in nations with stricter gun laws you will see that on a per capita basis violent crimes are just as high as they are here. It's just that more people die from stabbings and beatings than do here. But when all is said and done, dead is dead is dead."
1333,"Because the common defintions of God include such characteristics as sentience, omnipotence, omniscience, etc, none of which would apply to a multiverse. All you're trying to do here is say that God exists by changing the defintion of God. That's cheating."
1334,"So despite his long article Behe is still working on the same assumption I stated above: function is only a product of conscious design: there is no other valid explaination of the structure and function of life.Now, what I'd like to hear you describe is exactly how intelligent design works in action: 1) How long does intelligent design take, x years or is it instantaneous?2) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world?3) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world?4) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones, as evidenced by the fossil record?5) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design?I'm most interested to hear your ideas on these points."
1335,Honest question Arch: where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years? I know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant?
1336,"Actually, they are genetic. Our cells have receptors which are triggered by exposure to pathogens; that's how we ""learn"" to fight off a disease. And not everyone has the same receptors, which ones you posses is a genetic trait. It's one of the reasons that Native Americans were so vulnerable to European diseases, they hadn't evolved the receptors that would have enabled them to build up defences against the diseases the Europeans had lived with for generations. If your hypothesis was correct we wouldn't see different populations having different reactions to the same disease."

1346,"There's more to the adoption of an atheistic stance than just rejecting the bible because it's scientifically false. 'The bible is scientific nonsense, therefore there is no god' is not a logical stance.Modern-day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures, past and present, and the consequent improbability that just one of them (and hey, waddaya know? It's mine!) is wholly true and all the others wholly false. This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing; others to conclude that the world's religions are all the product of a similar, purely mundane, process of cultural evolution, and that none actually reflects fundamental truths."
1347,"Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results."
1348,But only one qualifies as due process.  I'm anti-death penalty btw.
1349,"Actually gun crime in the UK is at a very low level. If you believe government statistics then gun crime is at its lowest level for years. Police travel in twos because it's easier to catch people when there's more than one of you. It's been standard practise for years in lots of countries. The armour is mostly stab-proof and is largely to counter the rise in gang-related knife crime. It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime)."
1350,"The claim that only through a belief in the Biblical God - or any God - can right and wrong be known is completely stupid. 1) Ever hear of humanism? 2) EVEN CHIMPS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING TREATED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY!

1351,"Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology."
1352,"Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis &amp; Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine)."

We take cars for granted now. We're not afraid of the government taking them away. We don't think it's necessary to add an amendment which specifically protects the right to own and drive cars."
1355,"Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried. Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently, and all we are talking about is giving them that choice. Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them.Though now that I think about it, you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples? Well, in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status. The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. I see no reason why this wouldn't be updated along with marriage.As for common law statutes being used against same-sex partners, well again, that is an argument against marriage or common law statutes, not against same-sex marriage specifically. It isn't a reason to disallow marriage to same-sex couples but allow it for opposite-sex couples."

1357,"This is true. Creationists, of course, are forced to make this bogus distinction, as the changes they call micro-evolution can hardly be denied, whilst what they call macro-evolution is the thing they are compelled to deny with every breath they take.  In the real world degrees of evolutionary change form a continuum, from point mutations conferring, say, antibiotic resistance on a bacterium, to full-scale genetic isolation and speciation. There is nowhere a sharp cut-off between qualitatively distinct levels of change. (In fact one of the major difficulties faced by creationists is explaining just what kind of mechanism would, in their view, enforce such a cut-off.)"

1361,"The scope of the conference was ONLY the discussion of illicit weapons trade on the international market. It had nothing at all to do with the ownership of weapons by private individuals EXCEPT as it pertained to the illicit sales of arms on the international market.  THATS IT. NOTHING ELSE. They were not debating private ownership of arms, and such debates were discouraged. When a group from handgun control inc. attempted to give a presentation, they were politely told that the the scope of the conference did NOT include privae gun ownership by individuals.

The Lord God formed the man(Adam) from the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.  (Genesis 2:7) This explains that God is the giver of life and He is the only one who can breathe life into something."

1372,"I've examined Hall's papers and they make interesting reading. However, further research, including some undertaken by Hall himself, has informed the debate greatly.  For one thing, many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation (your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response') as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis. The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit, correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant. The articles I've already cited, though they focus on the Cairns system's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception, also include Hall's work in their assessment.  Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants, acknowledging that a colleague's suggestion, that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct.  In short, though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes, it is not always an organismic response (eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes), and the 'successful' mutants do not always, or even mostly, arise from within that subpopulation.  Also, you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress. It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically (as well as empirically, as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate) not a prerequisite for evolution. It's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case, the environment's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change."
1373,"I see. So, you know the souls of others? and how God will judge them?  Interesting. That certainly does settle a few things...."
1374,No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.

Can you prove me that the Bible is correct and definitely the infallible word of God?

1379,"Hi NATO, I agree that irresponsible industrial pollution is damaging the environment and would never deny that at all. Acid Rain which is a side effect of air pollution has polluted more lakes, streams and rivers than direct dumping has and that is a direct result of heavy metals and other toxins being spewed into the atmosphere by industrial smoke stacks. So this reality goes without saying in my opinion.But environmental pollution is very different than extending the claim to the next level of Global Warming which implies that the worlds atmosphere is now incapable of repairing itself. That is the crux of this argument and if the atmosphere were so polluted that the Earth was unable to repair itself, then the air quality here in NH would be as polluted as it is in China and Russia even though we have no industrial air polluters at all to speak of here. That would be solid evidence that the volume of pollutants in the atmosphere is overwhelming the Earths ability to repair itself. But our air quality is pristine in comparison to any and all third world countries who are the largest polluters due to their lack of having any industrial pollution safeguards in place.So we must make the distinction between environmental pollution and air pollution clear because the Global Warming fraud is based specifically on the claim that air pollution is changing our weather and warming the planet, since all of the scientific evidence belies that claim."
1380,Thank you for your criticism. :D
1381,"Actually, the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times. The lowest estimate of the yearly cost for imprisoning somebody is around $22,000. The average amount of time a prisoner spends imprisoned after getting a life sentence is 60 years. Take into account the cost of building jails in order to house all these prisoners and you up the amount even more. After the average of 60 years for a life sentence, tax payers have spent $1,320,000 on ONE SINGLE PERSON. Imagine what this money could do in the education system? You said yourself, the only thing that may push the cost of the death penalty over life imprisonment is the ridiculous amount of appeals that are given. If only one appeal was given before the sentence was final, it would be far cheaper to exectue somebody than imprison them for life. How many times does a person need to prove their innocence? If they can't do it in the initial trial and after one appeal, sorry, game over...you lose. You can read more at this site:http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~tonya/spring/cap/pro5.htm"
1382,"Because Satan is a fallen angel. He had a chance to be with God, but he didn't take it. He could go back to God any time he wanted to, but he doesn't want to. He has free will. God won't take that away, even though He can."

1385,Your anti-freedom agenda. Its so funny how you label anything that has less governance than your comfort of suckling on that entitlement sow and following your fedgov masters is anarchy... I am not asking for anarchy. I am demanding my civil rights as a free born human being. 
1386,Actually it seems you are the one that is sick. You have this obsession with what others do with their sex life and want the government to try and prevent any kind of sex you don’t approve of. It looks like you are trying hard to repress homosexual desires you have. Otherwise why do you care what others do when it doesn’t affect you?I'm not for or against what other adults do with their consentual sex life. It's none of my business.
1387,"Abortion isn't a legal crime. How ever, in all other ways, it certainly is a crime.  I think the moderator should move this to abortion discussion."
1388,"Not in this instance, no. It isnÂ’t trying to parallel pregnancy per se(though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months), but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent. If the pro-life mantra is to be believed, it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do. So, the argument is applicable for 9 days, 9 months, 9 years or forever."
1389,"And in Daphnia you might want to consder that the specifics are known to some degree as to what compound serves as a signal of predators.  http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi...tract/fbi142v1  Just in case you are too lazy to read here is a bit of the article.  Daphnia may respond with an array of antipredator defences (behavioral, morphological, life-history) to a chemical cue (kairomone) exuded by its predators: fish and Chaoborus. Given the wide array of potential responses, it is an interesting question whether antipredator defences are coupled or independent of each other. Since antipredator responses are costly and even possessing the genetic information to respond to a certain predator might involve a cost, clones may only react to predators they co-occur with in nature. In this study we provide evidence for an uncoupling of responses by Daphnia pulex in several antipredator defences against Chaoborus. We were unable to detect a correlation between behavioral (migration), morphological (neck-spine induction), and life-history (growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction) responses. Furthermore, antipredator responses did not always comply with what is commonly believed. We found that Daphnia clones can migrate up or down when exposed to fish or Chaoborus kairomone, and that population growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction can increase or decrease in response to Chaoborus kairomone. We also show patterns in antipredator defences that seem to relate to the habitat from which clones were derived. Daphnia clones that were collected in habitats with Chaoborus as the dominant predator tended to react strongly to Chaoborus kairomone by migrating upward and producing neckspines. The migration behaviour against fish kairomone in these clones was often an unexpected upward migration. The Daphnia clone that co-existed with fish predators showed a downward migration in the presence of fish as well as Chaoborus kairomone. Clones that had occurred with either both or no predators had mixed responses. We sometimes found an upward migration in combination with smaller body size as a response to Chaoborus kairomone. This may be interpreted as a behavioural defence against Chaoborus and a life-history defence against fish. Daphnia seem not to exhibit defence behaviour against predators they do not co-occur with. It might be costly for Daphnia to maintain genetic information to respond to these predators and protect that information from genetic drift."
1390,"So basically you are saying that evolution is the one and only true explanation of how we came to be, and that it is okay for the schools to force students to accept this  fact . That is why they are failing."
1391,"Except that in some things, Ham and others cannot so judge. Their axioms are, by their lights, not congruent with reality but an accurate description of it. Note two standard responses where there is an apparent incongruity: we've misinterpreted what the bible says*; or, this will all be explained at the end of days.  In all other contexts, we'd describe such people as insane, of course. Here we merely deem them pious.  * Note that, for the literalists,  firmament  became  expanse  once we knew that the heavens were not a solid object into which stars could be affixed."
1392,"The abortion issue is one that rightwingers use to threaten women and keep them ""in their place."""
1393,"Say what? You cannot say for certain that anything would have happened. For all we know if the kids in the classroom had guns they could very well have started shooting and then how do the other students know which one is the real threat? After all, all of them are shooting fellow students, right? So how do they know who the shooter is if EVERYONE is shooting? Who knows what kind of massive gun fight such a thing could turn into.  I support gun rights as much as the next person. But having them in a school environment is just plain ridiculous."
1394,"So it's just a coincidence that nations that ban guns like England have much lower levels of gun violence and murder than the US? That's kind of hard to believe. NYC was so effective in reducing crime that the mayor of NYC was invited to Mexico City to help them reduce crime there. So I don't think the possibility that gun control has been effective in cities like NYC can be ruled out. You may be confusing cause and effect. You wouldn't walk into a hospital and declare that because there are a lot of sick people in a hospital that hospitals don't help people get better.That website starts off with the rumor that there are over 20,000 gun laws. Although this claim has been repeated numerous times by anti gun-control activists, has anybody been able to verify this claim? A recent study that counted the number of gun laws found ""only 300 relevant federal and state laws regarding the manufacture, design, sale, purchase, or possession of guns.""http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=12007Another reason not to put too must trust in biased websites that cherry pick the facts."
1395,I think there are few better things than self-evident irony. I love it. :)
1396,"By that standard, Lurch, it could also be termed 'pro-choice/anti-choice'.  I am pro-choice. This is due to a mixture of believing that a woman should be better qualified than the government to chose what happens to her own body, that a foetus is not 'alive' until it can survive outside the womb and have a mental existence, and that in certain conditions (ie harmful to mother, terminally disabled foetus) denying someone the right to chose an abortion is nothing more than dodging responsibility."
1397,"You're debating something that is no longer an option. You're arguing on the grounds of debunked precedent, as if the previous interpretations of the Second Amendment are somehow still viable. Well they aren't anymore, arguing old standing is no longer going to be an option for you or anyone else. All of your previous arguments have been eliminated from the equation. It's time to either evolve to meet the changing landscape, or go extinct like the dinosaurs."

1400,"No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.  Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out."
1401,And being an evil old darwinist I should add <smirk<.
1402,Only an atheist is arrogant enough to presume to question why God decided to do that.  The greatest scientist in history said about the order of the universe:  The Author of the system must have found it convenient.  Birds did not evolve one either. They were created with it up an running.
1403,So why not then cure AIDS? And why are you playing upon the old Gay Aids myth? once again not one point that is relevant to the questions I asked... Your just shifting blame and scapegoating...
1404,"Actually, it depends on what you are comparing and how you want to characterize certain phenomena.If you are comparing only coding sequence, then it is on the order of 99%. If you are comparing coding and noncoding sequence, it is on the order of 97-98%. If you consider indels not as one-time events that incorporate large-scale changes of sequence, but count the individual nuclotides within each indel, then it comes out to 94-95%.What the creationists never seem to understand is that if you are goiong to adopt the comparison method in which indels are treated as colelctions of nuclotide changes rather than one-time events, ALL % similarities between ALL taxa will be lowered somewhat.This means that when they predictably trot out some bastardized version of Haldane's dilemma claiming that the nmew lower similarity is even harder for evolution to explain, they do not realize how devastating this method of accounting is for creationism genetics.For now the 'increased dissimilarity' has to be accounted for in the very short time frames allowed by biblically-constrained science - about 4,500 years instead of the hundreds of thousands or millions of years during which accumulations of DNA change can be accounted for.So desperate are they ro 'diss Darwin' that they don't recognize the problems their arguments cause for their own ideology.That or they don't care."
1405,"But if one can be a person without having unique DNA, then your qualification is at best incomplete. As it stands, it follows from your claim that monozygotic multiple births are not people.  See my further deconstruction of your arguments in your own  Kill! Kill! Kill!  thread."

1410,"Excellent post DamEtel, I'm continually impressed by your very knowledgeable and thorough contributions here.  The response you received was exactly what I was expecting.  When faced with evidence so powerful that a pseudoscience cannot even be developed to offer an alternate explanation (ID theory, flood geology, etc..), the reply is inevitably baseless if and buts, or the old standby -   The Lord works in mysterious ways.   To actually face the data head on would present a fundamental challenge to one's faith and religion, and that, as I'm sure you're aware, will be avoided at all cost.  Waxy"

1418,"I don't recall ever saying they were.  However, all of that is quite beside the point in the case under discussion. Elevated mutation rates were experienced by less than a fifth of the adapted bacteria. In addition, the rate in that subpopulation was elevated as a coincidental byproduct of gene duplication (a mutagenic promoter being co-located with the gene that conferred a reproductive advantage), and did not itself confer any benefit. The other 4/5ths of the bacteria which possessed duplicate lac- genes at the time of plating accumulated additional mutations at normal rates, including additional duplicate lac- genes at the same random-chance-per-division rate as they had prior to the selective environment being imposed. The rate of reversion to lac+ was also the same, on a per-gene basis, as in the absence of the selective environment; only the large numbers of lac- duplicates in the selected-for adaptive mutants made it more likely that one of them would revert.  In short, the organismic response you say makes the whole process intentional and systematic simply didn't happen, not here anyway. Neither the directed mutation, nor the subpopulation hypermutation hypotheses fit the facts."

They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).  That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science.  Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything.

I could also point out that the fetus is not responsible for the pregnancy in that it did not decide on it's own to come into existence and plant itself in the mother's womb but rather it was the mother and father that made the child through their actions so why is it made to pay the ultimate price?"

1434,"I think that if Montalban is anything, he is opportunistic. Someone (Ungerdunn I think) pointed out to him that the phrase, ""survival of the fittest"" reduces to a tautology. As seems to be his bent, Montalban generalized that fact to claim that somehow evolution is a tautology. As I mentioned in a previous post, without further criterion, ""survival of the fittest"" is a tautology. But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase. Certainly Montalban has read ""Origin"" since he quotes it. How is it that he missed chapter 2? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin's meaning in chapter 1?But I will concede that ""Origin"" is not an easy read. Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary, as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level. Darwin was not addressing a popular audience, even though his book became popular. Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day. English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin's day and biology has advanced. When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said (even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated), it is a matter of historical significance only. Darwin's theories have been supported or falsified many times over. For the most part, his theories have been supported. He was wrong on some minor points. Essentially, a quote from Darwin without reference to some meaningful publication since is quite meaningless."

1470,No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all.

1474,"**  I wasn't making a 'point', just an observation. But since you want a 'point', nip back over to  The Swamp ,[that is, 'Internet Infidels (atheists)DB', and ask Oolon Colophid[sp.?] why he thinks the human appendix makes his 'point'."
1475,He only understands natural selection when he belives that it goes against what is accepted by scientists.
1476,"But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?"
1477,"So that no girl, underage or otherwise, refuses to seek treatment for fear of what their parents will think or say. If a girl cannot be tested for a STD without parental notification and she does not wish her parents to know she had sex (or fears their wrath), she may not go in for testing.  In general, knowing whether you have a STD is a good thing."
1478,Note the operative word is particular. The point being there are a miriad of people who can take on the responsibility of a born child. That is not the case in pregnancy.
1479,Wrong. It is a precision machine designed to kill effectively. It can be operated by other than human means.
1480,"I'll ask the question that needs to be asked.If France qualifies as a ""developed nation"" as we've been lead to believe, why did the homeowner have to resort to getting close enough that he could strangle the burglar?Surely if you're a developed nation, you're not going to force your own people to put themselves in harms way while they're in the process of saving themselves, right?"
1481,That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.
1482,"In that case, your idea is already falsified, because there are too many intermediate fossils to count."
1483,Great site! I know I'll refer to it in the future. Thanks. emoticon_xgood
1484,"yes, and it is also a complex train of economics leading down all the way to your door."
1485,If guns make you happy and you do not break and criminal codes. Then you need no reason nor do you have to justify yourself to anyone. The Constitution or firearms laws have nothing to do with  if you need one .
1486,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! rotflmao. yOU just committed suicide, ugh, gory!"
1487,Well it's more efficient than the bill we just passed...I think we agree that much.
1488,"So we haven’t had rulers in the past commit atrocities at a massive level when atheism wasn’t as prevalent? If I find a Christian leader who killed millions, would you accept that Christianity is just as dangerous as atheism (and by just as dangerous I mean not at all dangerous, it’s the immoral people that do wrong. Now if you would like to show that crime is committed mainly by atheists (percentage wise) then you could have a point… but until then…)"
1489,HOT DAMN Nato maybe we better hot foot it up their and help keep that there  Mexican drug cartel out.emoticon_xloveemoticon_xbouncer
1490,"You may not have intended to, but you've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes, with regards to her family - and you'd stick out of it, regardless.  Also, interestingly, there's no man in this 'idealy free' family of yours.  After reading some of the posts on the gun control forum, I think that the USA population is a lot more dense."
1491,"It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have."
1492,"We agree that there certainly is a problem, correct?  Could it be video games, movies, or developmental issues, or??  Before we debate thoes topics, lets examine the same issue in the U.K.  Are video games in the UK? Yes.  Are violent movies in the UK? Yes.  Are there bad bad parents / psychopaths / nuts in the UK? Yes.  Are handguns legal in the UK? NO  Does the UK have shooting rampages as often as the USA? NO  Are video games in the USA? Yes.  Are violent movies in the USA? Yes.  Are there bad parents / psychopaths / nuts in the USA? Yes.  Are hanguns legal in the USA? YES  Does the USA have shooting rampages more often then the UK? YES  It dosn't take a genius to find a correlation between handguns being legal and shooting rampages.  I agree that guns are not the problem in and of themselves, but humans are the problem; and humans wield guns.  Clearly, handguns should be illegal."
1493,"Thanks!  There's a petrified forest in Mississippi also. I don't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces, but I'll find out next trip.  I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?  Likely, the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen. Other inert gases could have done the same."
1494,"no no! through the power of god, the animals all came themselves, and lined up ready for the ride, haven't you seen the movie?!?"
1495,Black panthers?  MLK died before Heston was NRA presdent?  Heston ran for office?  A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to  win  an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of  reasoning  has the following form:  1. Topic A is under discussion.  2. Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).  3. Topic A is abandoned.  Either connect the dots or shut up!
1496,"That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress."
1497,I know I have told you this before but a trimester has no science meaning in it at all. It is simply just a term to say  3 months . I'm not sure how a man-made time split can be used to determine who is an isnt' a person...but maybe you can explain this.  Perhaps you could just say  Thanks for helping but I don't think that is what it means  instead of flaming.
1498,Of course evolutionists want to remove any possible religious connotation from evolutionary teaching. Evolution isn't science and to introduce religion has been found unconstitutional several times. And you are actually on a school board making decisions about what children are taught? How sad.
1499,Actually they do. Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely. Did you not notice where the article came from? From a paper in India. I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania.Save your snobbery for someone else.
1500,See Begging the Question
1501,"Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person)."
1502,"Simple solution: Schools should be allowed to have their personal authority back over children during school hours. Now they can do nothing but point a finger and shake it and that's it. However they do find it perfectly reasonable to suspend someone over: a drink, shirt, hair color, drawing or something else completely useless that doesn't hurt anyone.  Reason behind all the current school failures in authority: Too many liberal teachers."
1503,"404. Please post relevant, unbroken links. As for butterflies, the full grown, living ones can probably breed, but the others can't."
1504,"Clearly this is true. There are a multitude of denominations from every religion. This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done. Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion. The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived. Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church, some believe the art must stay in the church.Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return. No one wrote a book on the Religion.The Religion changed a great deal through time. King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to.One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery. This was clearly at odds with King James. Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws."
1505,"That would bother me, if the law did anything but regulate the cosmetics of a weapon. And force me to change magazines every ten rounds.  P.S. WHen is building your product to comply with the law 'circumventing the law?' Should we ban SUV's because when laws were put on to increase fuel mileage, the car manufactures made them get better gas mileage?"
1506,This is a toughie. Let me think about it and I'll get back to you...
1507,"Yes, it means the kind of regulations that would be necessary to create an effective militia, not necessarily those aimed at protecting public safety. And it is because groups like the NRA don't advocate such legislation that Cornell says that neither side is interested in protecting or returning to the original right to bear arms."
1508,I don't drink and I'm not overweight.  But I bet you have a bad habit with junk food and FOX news/couch potatoism. With a sixpack by your side.
1509,"Evidence isn't peer reviewed.(*-see correction below)  Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what's peer reviewed.  And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't  proven  anything.  The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.  Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered.  The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.  There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians."
1510,"And until they later contradict themselves their ruling is final, it doesn't matter if it's right or not, it's the way it is. The subject is closed, individual rights has won out, the duty to the state has been executed for charges of treason."
1511,"how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?  the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23"
1512,"Yes Joe, please quit trying to impose your way of life on us. The majority of americans are against this sort of behavior, yet you continue to try to impose this aberrant behavior on the rest of society. We dont want any part of it."
1513,"Summarize that article, please. Cutting-and-pasting literally everything on a webpage is usually good evidence that meaningful comprehension is lacking."
1514,"Just out of curiosity, what do you feel you could sue the company for? Descrimination? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys? After all, I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys. Doesn't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods? After all, they are the biggest retailer in my area."
1515,"I understand your points... all I am saying is that these are issues that come up.. not saying that these are the ONLY issues... I'm not judging that the rapist in the example wasn't craving affection or anything like that... I'm not judging anyone on that one... my point was that if a woman is raped and becomes pregnant, she has become pregnant through no choice of her own. But I am not about to take the side of a rapist... I don't care how abused they were. When I said that the woman would be reliving the rape, I didn't mean that they wouldn't otherwise... but think if you were a woman and were raped, and became pregnant by someone you didn't know or know anything about... As for the murder part of it, what is it called when anti-abortionists picket outside clinics and shoot and kill the abortion doctors? Is that not murder? Doesn't that make them hypocrites?"
1516,It is an attempt to follow the law and the law states equal protection for all citizens...hence the 14th ammendment.
1517,"But the civil war wasn't fought for slavery. If you will recall the average northern soldier wasn't too fond of blacks, and that is not only sugar coating it, but saying it in the nicest terms possible. The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons, the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal. Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal. It took some time before they could even fight. Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war. I won't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal didn't even exist."
1518,"Yes. But that means that the cat ""kind"", a single pair, produced 4 genera with 36 species in, at most, a couple hundred years. And that doesn't even include domestic cats. It makes the head of any evolutionary biologist spin! Creationists who wish to deny evolution invoke hyperevolution for thousands of ""kinds"" to yield millions of species in hundreds of years. And yet, they deny evolution."
1519,So you reject the existence of the soul?
1520,"You mean on the road shared with the adjacent property they claim as tribal land?  Mr. Brown was able to attend ball games. Not exactly held captive was he?  Where in Canada is it illegal to defend yourself with a firearm, given sufficient threat?  And what did the Indians do to the Brown's to justify using deadly force?"

1522,"According to the British Crime Survey, the most reliable measure of crime of crime in the UK because it counts crimes whether or not they are reported to police, the crime rate has been falling.   Crime in England and Wales remains stable and the chances of being a victim of crime are still the lowest in more than twenty years, according to the first quarterly crime update published today by the Home Office   In 1997 England had its gun buyback. What has happened since then?   British Crime Survey trends since 1997 indicate:  All crime down 27 per cent  Burglary down 39 per cent  Vehicle thefts down 32 per cent  Violence crime down 26 per cent   http://www.policesupers.com/scripts/...SP?news_id=314  Unlike the British Crime Survey, the police statistics show an increase in crime, but this is because the police have changed their system for recording crime. The UK police have adopted the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), a system which requires them to record crime more accurately."
1523,But she murdered her child.  There are laws in Austrailia (and hopefully someday in the U.S.) against killing your pre-birth children.
1524,"The bahavior is only ""morally corrupted"" if there is, in fact, something wrong with what they did.  I don't see it."
1525,A nonsensical concept. Genetic change is genetic change. Evolutionary theory doesn't contain any concept of progress. Only scientific illiterate creationists try to insist that it does.
1526,"And so am I...Dear rapture -- With all due respect, I would encourage you to formulate a clear thought and communicate it in a way that an average joe like me will be able to understand. As your two posts are written, I have no clue what you are attempting to communicate. I do have some interest in the topic of viability though, so if you could perhaps explain what you are saying, I would be interested in discussing the topic with you.Thanks!The Bootfitter"
1527,So?  I look into the clouds and see a cow. Clouds aren't telling me to have a steak.
1528,I would like him to provide evidence in support of his repeated claim that posters here have frequently said  that honest citizens will commit crimes if given guns. 
1529,"No, no. It was all my fault. I was praying that she find peace, and my mother-in-law is a priest so I've got an in with God.  I guess Jesus figured that all believers would want, and pray for, the same thing. Oops."
1530,"I personally believe in science because there is more evidence of it than there is of creation. Science is obviously based on multiple key assumptions, but creation is based on a lot more.  The link is GREAT.  However:  Someone who does evil things isn't simply not doing good things, he is specifically doing evil. Evil is not the absence of good."
1531,I think maybe you have hit yourself in the head with the Bible a few times too often.
1532,"So you have genes for brown eyes and for blue eyes and for green eyes? Chihuahuas have the genes to make them Great Danes? Do the experiment, supersport.Do it. C'mon. Shut me up. I dare you. For someone always accusing ""Darwinists"" of never doing appropriate experiments, this is one you should have no problem doing. Hop to it.(That's your cue to run away and start a new thread.)"
1533,"The question is: To what degree do wars cull out particular genes as opposed to ideas? Another thing to consider is not who is getting killed, but who is being born. Unless, something is done about the niche, it will just get filled again by whoever was decimated. Compare: Germans (hypothetically) settling in the Ukraine versus the US bombing of Hiroshima (which was not then settled by the US). Consistent genetic pressure is really key."
1534,"I agree, but the libs would weep and call her a murderer. I suppose they'd rather have her submit to this vile person. They support pacifism, and in New York, she'd be in prison. Good thing people in my area have common sense."
1535,"Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims.  PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful."
1536,"It isn't possible to tell. What is called the ""scientific"" approach is to analyse social statistics to derive probabilities, a methodology which assumes that the present is the same as the past, all well and good for the physical sciences, where the way particles behave does not change, but inappropriate in application to complex systems like people, that may react in ways totally unanticipated.Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems, but the more ways you try to manipulate them, the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes.So what do you do then, just take this method anyway, even given you can't predict the results, just take your best shot? When it fails, just say ""oops, well, we had good intentions, we can't be blamed"". If that's all we have to work with, we are truly screwed. There are however, alternative ways of deciding whether you should do something to trying to predict its outcome."
1537,"This crushes ToE at the most fundamental level. I've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is. The popultion has been told for decades that they are simply a culmination of their genes. How many times have you heard, ""It's in the genes....""???? Not only that but the whole theory of evolution is a result of changes in genes (or alleles). Ha! Now, however, genes are ""losing their glitter."" Now, it's RNA that seems to be ""running the show."" How can it get anymore embarrassing for science that they got the premise wrong for all these years? Why do you think the dude in the article said how ""depressing"" all this is? Evolutionists have screwed up in that they have always assumed that the gene is the fundamental unit of life, that complexity goes no further down in the organism and that what determines what or who you are stops at your genes! FALSE! DNA does not dictate who we are, it's the other way around: DNA is just a representative of what we are, where we live, what our social environment is, what our ecological environment is, etc. DNA is not a dictator of life nor does it define us......it's a follower of life and is manipulated by who we are. This reality indeed flips all of biology and ToE on its head. You can deny it all you want -- and I'm sure you will because you have completely brainwashed yourself. The sun is setting on ToE. Science has lead us astray for decades, and now it's coming back to bite them. What an embarrassment."
1538,"Simply pointing out that swords cut in both directions.  Be that as it may, no one has refuted that there are more cases of Concealed Carry Permit holders who have gone off and assaulted people than there have been school shootings.  Care to try? Omegaman tried, failed, and went silent on the topic."
1539,"So, why don't you give it a try???"
1540,"Well, I see that Hunter continues with his intentional ignorance. Even though it has been explained to him on several occasions, he still chants his ""evolution is only a theory"" mantra in hopes that his audience will be as ignorant as he. Yes, evolution is a theory. In science that means that it has been tested and accepted as essentially correct. Evolution is a theory just as gravity is a theory - several in fact; Newtonian gravity, general relativity, and quantum gravity. None of those theories actually work in all situations.But for all practical purposes, evolution has been proven. That's easy since evolution has been observed and the theories are build on the facts of those observations.You will notice that Hunter hasn't proven any of his assertions. He just knows that there are talking snakes, and magical beings that make people out of dirt. Sure - go ahead and start with the Bible so you can get the mythology of two different creation stories, an impossible flood, and such fantasies as a man being swallowed by a whale or the any human would know about a god that wagers with Satan, out of the way. Not only will you find no proof to support the Bible, you won't evern find any evidence."
1541,Thanks. Well I'm a resident of California currently but my partner has orders to Virginia. If they allow outside residents to apply for a license we'll do it Considering DC is only a four hour drive or so.
1542,"Of course they didn't see it walk, it's a different genus altogether."
1543,"Well this was easy!  http://www.projectexploration.org/ni...11_04_2000.htm  There?s something big over here!? shouted Allison. We gathered around her find, a blackened, fossilized skull fragment more than a foot across. After puzzling over the piece briefly, I declared ?It?s a cow, a fossilized cow skull.?  Now what was a fossil cow skull doing in a place like this ? an area rich in dinosaur bone more than 100 million years old?  More pieces of the puzzle were being picked up by other team members. Dave exclaimed gleefully, ?Look, it?s human! Part of the skull!? as he held high the curved plate of bone that shields the massive human brain. He never expected to find fossil humans on a dinosaur expedition"
1544,"Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848."
1545,"Actually, they do. They just don't want it to leak out. But it's too late. The cat is out of the bag. Internal documents from the Discovery Institute as well as statements by ID creation proponents from the Dover trial make it quite clear that ID creationism is based on religion and scripture as much as  creation science  was."
1546,#1 - Evolution continues today. Some organisms evolve relatively quickly. It has and is being observed. Do some research.  #2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena. It must have happened by itself if there is no Creator. There are several theories about the specifics. I happen to think lightning was involved.  #3 - It is thought humans evolved  away  from the other apes due to environmental pressures. When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate. That change in climate forced our ancestors from the trees which somehow contributed to our  rapid  and unprecedented brain development.  #4 - Geology and radioactive isotopes.
1547,No baby is more precious than another as far as my personal beliefs go it is no more alright to terminate a baby concieved through rape/incest than it is to terminate a baby classed as a mistake/inconvenience.
1548,"Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise. "
1549,"Exactly, which brings us back to square 1. Creationism is based on religion, and Evolution is based on the Scientific method, but is not proven. Creationism isnt even near being proven. So, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?"
1550,It is my understanding that it involves only domestic violence misdemeanor cases with a conviction.
1551,"I think that's the first thing you've said (in this forum) that I agree with. Not only that, but belief in God is illogical."
1552,"This is actually humorous coming from you who has absolutely no concept that you are a spiritual being, or the extra dimension of yourself which that reality means to you. In other words antonia, It is the epitome of self deceit to lie to oneself about who they are. And you define that darkness which is the great lie you represent so completely."
1553,"Actually Montalban, there is a federal ordinance requiring protestors to stay at least thirty feet from the clinic's property. Were they allowed to go inside and talk to the women? Of course not. Most of the rabid anti-abortionists, (the ones that show up outside the clinic with their disgusting signs and propaganda, shrieking at the women, throwing rotten fruit and worse at them) have absolutely no right to speak to these women, as their contact with them could be at the least disturbing and at the worst violent and dangerous. Thankful though I am for the ordinance, it is not enough, and in some cases, it is not enforced. There are cases of the police ""looking the other way"" because they agree with the protestors.In my opinion, these protestors should be arrested and prosecuted for harassment, assault, unlawful assembly, and anything else we can pin on them. Yes, in america the first ammendment gives you the right to peaceful assembly and protest, and that right should be protected. But with any other protest, the organisers have to get the proper permits, and police have to be on hand in case anything gets unruly. The protests that occur outside a clinic are neither lawful, nor peaceful."
1554,"Well, I'm not sure if he consumed alcohol or not, but his doctor gave him daily  vitamin  shots that contained vitamins as well as amphetamines and maybe other drugs that doctors at the time thought were mentally beneficial.  And I've never heard of him being a vegetarian.  I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite, but I don't think they mentioned his being a veggie.  I don't see how being a tetotaller and a vegetarian are good characteristics."
1555,"What in the name of heaven is ""passive particulate selection"" is that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - I challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature. And Mendel's theory was itself (if anything is) particulate in nature and it was NOT derived from Darwin at all. It preceded Darwin and later of course DID serve as a plug in addition to supplant Darwins own inadequate theory of inheritance. And of course Mendel is long ago supplanted by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge.As to ""dynamic sytemic adaptation"" I also suggest you need to document where that term originates from other than yourself. Just what does that mean which is NOT covered by the vary-select-inherit process? Please tell us oh mighty lagomorph how antibiotic resistance arises by ""dynamic systemic adaptation"" instead of plain old VSI processes and how you distinguish the two.[QUOTEHave to go now.[/QUOTE]Good because my tolerance for people who pontificate in pseudoscientific terms while pretending to themselves that they know what they are talking about is wearing very very thin."
1556,Actually true. But I fail to understand the point. mtDNA from Neandertals seems to indicate that they are not ancestral and did not interbreed with modern humans. Neither are mammoths ancestral to modern elephants. In both cases the evidence indicates that they are related species. What was your point?
1557,Well then present it and stop being stupid.
1558,"[On ancient Athens]: In the end, more than freedom, they wanted security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost it all &#8211; security, comfort, and freedom. When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again.  &#8211; Edward Gibbon  History repeats itself when forgotten."
1559,"No. You're missing the point. Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.Al Gore is a shyster...just like Michael Moore. Documentary, my XXX!Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before.

Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly, yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California.We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills).

The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming. The Government’s expert was forced to concede that this is not correct.2. The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.3. The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government’s expert had to accept that it was “not possible” to attribute one-off events to global warming.4. The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government’s expert had to accept that this was not the case.5. The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.6. The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant’s evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.7. The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.8. The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.9. The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.10. The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.11. The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand. The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim.Stay tuned as the UK High Court's final ruling may impose additional restrictions on teaching An Inconvenient Truth in classes. They may also point out additional inaccuracies as we all know they only scratched the surface above.http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php?extend.24http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles...polarbears.htmhttp://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=3400http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=11548http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1350746/posts"
1560,You just say this because you want to murder helpless wromb-trapped human beings. You cannot just say you personally believe something in a debate.
1561,"There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction.  As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the  Son of God  and the  Son of Man , which means  Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.  I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.  Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws."
1562,"I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal. What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be. However, I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away. Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago."
1563,"No... you're not entirely correct. You can be skeptical all you want, but the empirical evidence is overwhelming for a world wide flood, a global cataclysm... as I stated earlier, you're not even taken seriously even in the secualar world of ""science"" if you try to refute the flood record, the flood is solid and is not privy to question. Enoch built the first pyramids, and his were superior in quality to he knock-offs of later days. The flood has been dated to have occured about 4400 to 4600 B.C."
1564,"Doesn't matter? If you're still on your straw man, whatever, if you are referring to an individual pharmacists not servicing based ON religion (Which is the case in many instances), then it's in black and white as against the law.Regarding firing, if it's not in the press or if it's good/neutral press sure, some minority groups don't get equal treatment under the law, that's nothing new to America. Yet if it's national bad press that builds up, no, businesses distance themsleves from such nonsnese. They have on gay rights/health benefits, they will on drugs. Their business is to serve customers, not to promote religious mumbo jumbo. A few companies may indeed choose to not carry, who cares, that's your straw man. I'm talking about individual pharmacists in the large chains (wal mart, grocery stores, etc.) making a choice based on discrimination, refusal to service an individual."
1565,"I would agree.  How do you propose getting it enforced for private party sales though? I'd think that would be hard to do.  Gun safes?  If so, I'd agree, no one should leave their guns easily steal-able while they are away."
1566,"oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism."
1567,"Are you like a Chinese government official or something? Oh wait. I forgot, the Chinese government controls what you say anyway, so I guess it matters not."
1568,Don't think so. Provide an example of an  unbridaled capitalist  system operating in the 19th century.
1569,"In what race? Creation, as in a literal interpretation of Genesis? How is that possible?"
1570,"When did this ""ice age"" take place? Between 4000-4500BC?"
1571,"Uh yeah, do you know what side you're on? You just supported my argument"
1572,Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.
1573,"But wait, you said that science is unprovable. How did we build up the world, conquer the air, sea and space without unprovable science?!"
1574,"So, you're just an anti-geologist, anti-cosmologist, anti-archaeologist, anti-physicist, and probably a few more that I can't be arsed to think of right now. *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you're an anti-science religious nutter."
1575,"Well, here's another quote from Allan Feduucia:""Feathers are unique to birds, and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified."" (J. Alan Feduccia, The Age of Birds, Harvard University Press, 1980, pg. 52)Sounds contradictory to me!"
1576,"this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic"
1577,"We've covered that: zoos do not include predators or prey in those environments. And even if they didn't document minor phenotypic changes, they would surely notice a porcupine being born with no quills, or a tortoise with no shell!"
1578,"so if right now, i ask god for forgivness, someone kills me, i will go to heaven by default? makes sense to me, i mean, i dont have time to sin..."
1579,"A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology)."
1580,"First of all, welcome :D  I believe as you do, that having a child is not always the best and most responsible thing to do in certain circumstances. For what it is worth, I think you did the right thing, for you and your current children."
1581,"And way too many of them. Of course what do you expect witht the state run media, a solid lock on education to the point of propaganda and massive voter fraud. They don't say the graveyards in Cook County IL vote early and often for nothing."
1582,religion: commitment or devotion to religious faith or OBSERVANCE  religious: relating to or manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ULTIMATE REALITY or diety  Therefore we can conclude that atheism and agnosticism are religions.
1583,"This isn't my position. I'm arguing that your attempts to demonize magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds is foolish. Furthermore, if no honest citizen needs a 15 round magazine, then no police officer needs them either. If we can reload them quickly enough for it to not matter, then the police can do it too."
1584,"Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for ""walking in a mile in another's shoes"". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?"
1585,What is a waste of time is the fact the most creationists don't understand science. They listen to such people as Hovind and Ham and Baugh and believe that they are being told the truth. The fact that they don't know what the theory of evolution is only indicates that they haven't bothered to educate themselves before expressing opinions.
1586,So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.
1587,"Well, I said it before, and I'm going to say it again. This is exactly the kind of mentality I was afraid of. When you devalue life, then it becomes a matter of who  qualifies  to live."
1588,Actually it is. All the countries with public healthcare systems rank higher than the U.S. We are number 37. I thought we already went through this.
1589,"For years I've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. To date, no takers. Want to step up?"
1590,"This is an answer based on either BS or ignorance.Those without money can use Medicare or Medicaid to virtually pay for the entire pregnancy. WIC also supplements your own feeding IIRC with proteins and calcium products. I've known several people (including hard core conservatives) who've had to go this route 'because they couldn't afford a pregnancy'. And if your morality/ ethics prevents you from taking gov't funding, think of it as stuff you already paid for with taxes (now and later), you're just getting some of what you put in back.Furthermore, there are several agencies that would easily pay for all your needs provided you put the child up for adoption. "
1591,"I think Kronus pretty much covered that one...quite well actually. It's sad SS, you always harp against NS, but you obviously have no clue what NS is really all about. I suggest a little educational reading. I at least read the bible before I began to publically debate it's validity."
1592,"This is obviously incorrect since Earth and Mars are were created only 6,000 years ago. And how did they know that Mars would be so close this year?  I have other questions too. How do they know that Pluto has a 249 year orbit of the sun since it wasn't discovered until 1930. No one has seen it orbit the sun yet. How did they know that it would actually come closer to the sun than Neptune in 1979 and move forther away again in 1999? They told me that when I was young. But no one had ever seen it. It was just speculation - a scientific theory, right??"
1593,"BUT how is it not.....I have a committed realtionship, and after 4 years  ( longer than most heterosexual relationships) don't we deserve the same rights as you , even if.....you don't believe it is moral. We have given our lives to each other. How is that different from your relationship. Is yours better in some way?....NO it is not...."
1594,"What are you talking about? I thought we were talking about changes in allele frequencies and differential reproductive success, and you barf out some nonsense about information and molecules to man. What does that mean? How is that applicable to evolutionary theory? Are you a parrot or can you actually define information. Are you talking about Shannon information? Yaukey information? What do you mean when you say  information. "
1595,Ah.. hehe. That makes more sense  Allthough i sincerely doubt that atheism as in  rejection of the existance of god(s)  is a modern invention. Allthough I guess that it is becoming more widespread than it has been in several thousands of years...
1596,I'd like to see some proof of this.
1597,"It is so the womans decision. If the baby is in the womb they haven't experience life, so how can they miss it. And if they are a so called  soul  then they will come out somewhere else."
1598,"Please explain to me how radiometric dating is based on the presupposition that there is no God. You're telling me that if there was/is a God the results of radiometric dating change? Abiogenesis is not scientific theory, and for good reason. Like you said it just has no evidence. That's why it is considered a hypothesis. It is one of many including creation, which was taught in my public high school. I have no problem with this, but the problem becomes when it is taught as a fact or as a valid alternative to evolution. As long as the truth is taught, that there is really no proof for either abiogenesis or creation, I'm fine. But this debate is whether or not Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution."
1599,"What quaint illogic. Only people who marry can get divorced, so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates. If anything, a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than ""normal""."
1600,"Well, there's plenty of scientific evidence about fetal development, such that we can confidently say no  person  is established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy.  I think the decision should be up to the woman, as under U.S. law. Between her and her doctor, whoever else she freely chooses to share with. I think, at some point, in a normally developing pregnancy, a very fuzzy looking line is crossed. But that's why we have state regulations during the third trimester.  IMO, Latin American countries, until this day, are unduly under the influence of the Church, superstition and ignorance."
1601,"** Which is why you darwinists, for all that you parade yourselves as 'scientists', are really nothing but 'true believers', intent upon evangelizing your core ideology, materialist atheism."
1602,"The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment. "
1603,OH GOODY! Another meaningless quote.
1604,Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.
1605,Thank you.
1606,Depends on your definition of gun control.There are more ways to restrict access to guns than simply taking them away.
1607,"And/or, that it must have been Almighty God himself who zapped that little DNA nucleotide, because we all know that beneficial mutations never occur naturally :-)  I liked this part, which is yet another link showing relatedness between humans and fish. Creationists just hate this kind of evidence."
1608,"Because the common defintions of God include such characteristics as sentience, omnipotence, omniscience, etc, none of which would apply to a multiverse. All you're trying to do here is say that God exists by changing the defintion of God. That's cheating."
1609,"That only occurs with some animals under very specific conditions. And low and behold, animals need the genes that code for it."
1610," 'Arms' in this context were military arms not the personal weapons of private individuals. The context of 'depriving of the whole nation of arms' was the refusal of the British to conscript Indians into the British Army during the First World War. Gandhi was an extreme anti-militarist. The statement is odd coming out of him, but he used the circumstance for political purposes to advance the cause of Home Rule and Independence.http://www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html#gandhi "
1611,"No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.  The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se."
1612,You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.
1613,"You know, that sounds exactly what you are doing. I guess you are as foolish as they are."
1614,"Actually, matter can be created and destroyed. It is total energy that is conserved. One example is in a nuclear reactor. The mass of the fission products is less than that of the original fuel. Matter has been ""destroyed."" But ov course, it became a form of energy - eventually electricity. On the other side, virtual particles spring into existance all the time in a vacuum. But the are a particle and an anti-particle and the net energy is zero so energy is conserved. These ideas come from quantum mechanics. A virtual particle is a particle that can never be directly detected, but whose existence does have measurable effects. One of those effects is the Casimir effect. It is an attractive pressure between two flat, parallel metal plates placed very near to each other in a vacuum. The pressure is due to the reduced number of virtual particles between the plates. When the plates are very close, only particles of certain resonant wavelengths can exist between them. Thus, more particles on the outside push the plates together.Stephen Hawking talks a lot about virtual particle pairs in both A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell. "
1615,"Very many have: dolphins and whales, for example, and some cave-dwelling birds."
1616,"It logically follows from the moral foundation set up but you made to important claims or ""proclamations"" as you called it. 1) Treat others as you wish to be treated (golden rule) and 2) Mental existence is required to have valueMy morality was already nicely summed up by you (atleast part of it)"
1617,How about the simplistic explanation that people and other organisms have inhabitated the area since the Dinosaurs died?  If you bothered to read your own article:
1618,"You speak as if these two things are mutually exclusive, they are not. Government control of guns only works on those willing to obey the law. Government cannot control criminals, they can and should however punish them when they catch them.Allow me to ask you a question: Which is more important a perceived saftey via government control or the freedoms endowed by our creator and enumerated in the bill of rights?I asked you before (you didn't answer) what rights are you willing to give up for what you perceive as a safer life? You once posted that you were studied in the ways of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, as it could be argued that religion has killed more people then cancer would you be willing to give up that freedom? How about if the government said you can own a Bible but not a Koran? Or you could only buy one religios text per month?"
1619,Nice succinct summary on the state of affair with liberal journalism today.
1620,"No chance. And besides, my Mom still had the same amount of kids, how does this relate?"
1621,"I have, at various times saud I'm not really for late term abortions. I am NOT, however, appluding this ruling. Apparently you didn't read it thoroughly enough (either that or are purposely trying to get a  dig  in). The ruling says  Obviously you know that those that have stated we are not for late-term abortions also add the qualifier of allowing it in cases where the woman's health is threatened (see the thread set up by another_opinion - if I remember correctly who set it up). This decision obviously does not do this, and I am disgusted at this ruling. If it had, I would be applauding along with you, but it didn't.  EDIT: looks like Another_opinion beat me to it."
1622,"I didn't misunderstand you at all. Like I said, you are for persecuting religious people if they don't agree 100% with you."
1623,"Rationalizing again It is  It's truly less harmful than alcohol.[/quote] Rationalizing again It is still worse then alcohol with one beer or even 2 beers a day (which is pretty much average for a person of non-college age). You have a guy drink a beer a day and a guy smoke up a day and see the difference in 50yrs...you will know which one is the weed addict.  I've lost 2 friends to weed and my gf has actually had a friend get his head blown off so you probably won't convince me it is a good drug....however, like alcohol, it is impossible to convince someone addicted about how their addiction hurts them."
1624,"And for good reason. Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with... electrical engineering. Examples: Walter ReMine, Fred Williams, etc."
1625,"Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of  organic . However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however."
1626,Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?  I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.
1627,"On the contrary, anyone who takes an interest in such things is well placed to appreciate just how hard it is to grasp such distances."
1628,"And, the converse is true in the lower latitudes."
1629,"Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith. And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence, it is not a scientific theory."
1630,"There has been a lot of social speculation here, but none of it answers how legalizing gay marriage would harm the sanctity of marriage.  In other words can some one tell me why are a couple of fruits getting married going to lesson my marriage?"
1631,They don't have to. The government is exercising violence by threatening people with jail time if they cause injury to somebody else who's attacking them.
1632,"Collateral damage.  Just from what I've read and heard in the news, I know he's guilty.  The bleeding hearts will always ask whether the jury was correct. This is why appeals go on forever. This is why some guilty parties eventually get off on a technicality. He may yet get off Scott free."
1633,"Only a complete XXXXX, devoid of even the slightest measurable amount of critical thinking skills, would support Chicago's handgun ban."
1634,A rational mind.
1635,"Actually the bible really barely comments. Look how short and jumbled the Genesis account is. Genesis did not even fit what humans knew when it was written. So matching any creation theory to genesis is impossible. Unless you believe God created the heaven and earth twice, and created animals twice. Sure you can explain it away, but a verbal reading of the ACTUAL TEXT will make your head swim. I don’t wana be sacrilegious, but some parts of Genesis makes God look like he was telling a fish story to a really dumb scribe too lazy to get on his camel and go to the library of Alexandria , or worse one of his interns. I am a irrational creationist btw."
1636,"Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.  The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child."
1637,"That's your argument? ""Just surrender your guns now, you can still get them illegally later on?"" That's the dumbest argument I've heard yet since Galileo's argument of ""Just go ahead and register your guns now, if the police want them they'll confiscate them whether they're registered or not.""Also, in this sentence you just admitted that gun bans are useless. You said that people could easily acquire bans after they were banned. So you're admitting what Great Britain did was a useless tactic that can't have any beneficial results."
1638,"I believe that this is what they call 'sarcasm'.  As for the second part of your comment, why am I not surprised?"
1639,"You've made a point yes, but you haven't refuted anything. Every time something comes up you can't answer, you simply ignore it, and bring out another claim, which we then refute, you ignore....etc."
1640,"No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow"
1641,"...which -- although a very good point when it comes to refuting creationist claptrap -- is not even the major issue of this forum.Undesirable consequences of an effect do not make that effect false or nonexistent.Gravity ""breeds"" falling deaths, which are bad, so let's maintain that gravity doesn't exist..."
1642,Believe in what?  If it helps - God's love surpasses all logic. I have complete proof that God exists. From that point onward there is no need to argue with things that are deemed as logical.  To me there's more to life than the logical things.
1643,"Unknown criteria?  (1) the term &#8220;international terrorism&#8221; means activities that&#8212;  (A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would b"
1644,"No, that example dealt with how goverment should deal with it.  Does the ocean abide to your right to life as you drown?  Does the avalanche abide to your right to liberty as you are trapped?  Does the pack of hyenas abide to your right to property as they rob you of food?  An inalienable right can only be removed by God. Therefore everything BUT God must respect and abide to it. How can a right that is clearly not abided to be inalienable?"
1645,"ever notice that the mass shootings tend to occure in places where it is illegal for people to defend them selves with there legal firearm? the last one that tryed that was shot dead by a  church security guard  (person with a conseled carry permit, that volenterred to bring it with her to services).  how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport."
1646,"Well, it also deprives that person of rethinking their life, and maybe become a missionary for children in Afirca or something. You cannot judge a man's life on what he has done, you can judge him about those acts, but not his entire life.The death penalty is a contradictory measure. On one side, we say we want to protect the value of human life by putting murderers in jail, but on the other, we show utter contempt for that same value. How can you say you are protecting the life of your citizens (because you value it), while at the same time you end someone else's life. This is absurd."
1647,uh huh...I'm not buying it.
1648,"Well I don't know about you guys, but I was baptized so I'm out of that eternal damnation thing. emoticon_xgood"
1649,"Really? Let's consider the matter of Jesus' claimed virgin birth, a claim brought forth by Matthew long after Paul's time. Here's Paul on the subject...Rom 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;...which suggests that Paul considered Jesus' conception to be fairly routine. EZ, evidence contained within the NT points to a gradual evolution of Christology over a considerable period of time."
1650,You just don't get it. Americans are freemen. Your faith in governments over people is humorous... How does it fell to lick the bootheels of your government overlords..... Rights are inalienable to man. One man has NO right to intefere with another man. I should be able to do as I please as long as I do not intefere with others... How does your government feel about that?
1651,"And if people have a  religious belief  whereby they don't think blacks should vote, or that interracial marriage should occur, should governmental officials who have those  religious beliefs  just be allowed to ignore their duty?  What if I had a religious belief that prevented me from performing my governmental tasks for Christians? Should that be respected as well?  They are paid to do their job. People who get to pick and choose what their  job  should entail because of their religious beliefs should find another form of work.  If when I was in the military, I had suddenly stood up and said,  Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.   Should that be respected and I keep my  job ?"
1652,"Incorrect.   Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple."
1653,"So, IOW, you are saying that those of us who are intelligent enough to realize that your non existent imaginary god doesn't exist have a chemical imbalance? Wow, that's quite a stretch even for you Archie baby."
1654,"He didn't erase all evidence. We have the Bible account.  In fact, we've got accounts from heaps of different cultures all around the world. We've got cultures from all over who have a memory of what happened, and despite this, no one believes them."
1655,"The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves."
1656,"Yet again, ignoring the point of the article. Are you not familiar with the Grants' work?This is only one of several examples of quite rapid evolution that has been observed by the Grants on Daphne Major over what must now be about 30 years.Here's the situation. Essentially, there are two food sources from two different plants for the finches on Daphne Major. One is a small seed - easily cracked. The other is a large hard shelled seed. At one time, during a drought, the Grants observed that some native finches, Geospiza fortis, evolved larger beaks that enabled them to eat the larger, hard shelled seeds. In other words, the bell curve was extended at the large bill size end. The article (and I presume the paper published by the Grants) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch, G. magnirostris, with a correspondingly larger bill. The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size, having similar beak size. As a result, they directly competed for scarce resources. As a result, large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage. As a result, the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller, more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up, while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger, hard shelled seeds.Anyone interested should read Weiner, Jonathan. The Beak Of The Finch. 1994. Vantage Books, New York. It won a Pulitzer Prize and is the story of the Grants' research on Daphne Major."
1657,So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
1658,Then argue with yourself. Why bother having others answer for themselves emoticon_rolleyes :xcensored

1660,"Well, we can agree to disagree on that one. I won't bother putting it to a vote :)"
1661,"Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person."
1662,"So, if there was a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort?"
1663,"Yep. This is a good thing, might as well make use of a dead person. Too bad we can't experiment on dead human bodies w/o permission. It would benefit society a lot more if we could."
1664,"Strawman argument, obviously you never ""said"" it, your inferior Intellect cannot articulate what you really mean, it requires articulation by a Superior Being such as I. This the formal structure of your argument, citizen-slave, even if you are too slavebound to recognise Real Ultimate Truth. "
1665,"Invalid comparison. A leash is meant to keep a dog from getting loose and causing trouble, but there's normally no laws that prevent people from walking dogs in public. The only thing you need to keep a gun from causing trouble is decent judgment and common sense."

1668,Sensible gun control? Please check the sensible gun control laws in the UK during the 1990s. The gun grabbers did not stop there. They now have a gun ban.   it is important to remember that this dilemma started with the euphemistic  sensible first step.  - http://www.tsra.com/sensible.htm  It can happen here.
1669,"You don't need an FFL to transfer an out of state  antique  firearm. I believe it is also OK for a minor to purchase and own an antique firearm. In addition, I believe the NFA doesn't apply to antique firearms. (Am I correct on that last one?)  So, zachvac can mail order a double barreled shotgun, saw the barrels short, and attach a pistol grip, legally."
1670,"haha, so because of this you should make fun of men and not women? That makes no sense but I figured you'd say this."
1671,"Because quite simply, it is all what we observe. One has never observed a mutation that has been seen to increase the information in the genome. If there have been any mutations that have led to an increase in information, please state it."
1672,"44 dead in just one day, in a drug battle. On an island nation no less.  And take a look at the video. Those are M16s being carried by the Jamaican government's soldiers.  I suppose liberals are going to try and blame Jamaica's problems on America too"
1673,"The Supreme Court has declared that the Second Amendment isn't about hunting, so this argument is dead and moot.I'd also suggest that you and this article author do a little research and get with the times. The AR-15 has officially been adopted as the hunting rifle of the 21st century. Remington now makes a version, the R-15, marketed exclusively toward hunters."
1674,"So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated."
1675,"I believe that anyone should be able to choose death at any time. If a criminal asks for the death penalty, give them a psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental state. If they are sound of mind, them give them their wish. It saves time, money, resources, and is the ultimate prevention of recidivism."

1677,"I got an interesting tid bit for you:http://www.2ampd.net/Articles/difiElitist.htmFirst read the text. The anti-gun senator is noted for having the ONLY legal concealed gun in the city of San Francisco.Also note as a person who carried a concealed gun and still keeps a .357 magnum for protection, that she should KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER, until your aming at your target."
1678,"I think there's a few points to be made here -1) This is a forum specifically for the purpose of discussing God and religion. Thousands, hundred's of thousands, maybe even billions of people who don't believe in God haven't bothered to seek it out, they have no interest, it attracts those that do have an interest in learning how and why others think and do as they do.2) Discussing something, no matter what the reason or how much it is discussed, does not lend any validity to what is being discussed. There is an infinite number of examples I could give to illustrate that point. Take in a sci-fi convention some time as a prime example.3) I don't see so much the discussion of ""is there a God/isn't there a God"", as I do the discussion of religion and the Bible. That is a very important distinction. Religion is very real, and affects all of us, whether we are believers in it or not. Whether or not Bigfoot exists, or the Klingons are invading someone, has no bearing whatsoever on my life or reality, religion does. I think that is the reason you see such fervent discussion and rejection of Christianity on forums like this. Why the large outcry? Those in the minority always tend to be more vocal, they have to be, or they'd simply be overwhelmed by the ""silent"" majority.WaxyP.S. Don't sell yourself short, you more than hold your own on these forums."
1679,"Actually, that's not true. While all of the sciences actually support one another, one can be a chemist and not accept evolution. One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution."
1680,"But because your book of mythology tells you about a week of creation, you prefer that (because it requires less thought) to examining reality."
1681,Only if they do the same thing for driver licences (cars are deadly).  I would not be killed if they did an instant check that was seperate from the gun purchase... Although I would be supsicious....
1682,"If little Jimmy was dead, this analogy might have some merits. Otherwise, compassion for little Jimmy is naturally based on the agony he will feel when he wakes up... One could also feel compassion towards poor little Jimmys family and friends (in the case Jimmy is dead). Ecpessially if little Jimmys body has been mutilated by some weird ugly guy."
1683,"ever notice that the mass shootings tend to occure in places where it is illegal for people to defend them selves with there legal firearm? the last one that tryed that was shot dead by a  church security guard  (person with a conseled carry permit, that volenterred to bring it with her to services).  how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport."
1684,"Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Run a google search for ""man shoots self"" the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny. Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though."
1685,"Our media hardly ever talks about it, yet our media keeps obsessing over a few deaths in Isreal, or the Sniper shooting. Why doesn't our media talk more about the heat wave? Because most Americans don't care just because France didn't help us fight Iraq."
1686,"And thus, pro-choicer are more mathematical and scientifical. We are more logical than the pro-lifers, and just don't blindly make assumptions about human life, because of its consequences."
1687,"The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section."
1688,"You follow atheism because you don't understand theism. It is Creation vs. Evolution BTW. I am a blunt person on the net. So excuse me. To put it plainly if you want a God get one, but if you don't then forget about it live and die.Do you want a God or not?"
1689,"Your logic is that if no one was there to witness it, it therefore did not happen. Under that logic, creation did not happen because no one was there to witness it, God does not count because we can't even prove it exists, much less hold it accountable for being there to witness it. The entire argument based around the witness via your argument is worthless."
1690,"Some apply logic, some do not. So much for contradictory thinking.What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind? Hold the mythology, please.from infidels.org - The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ""the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference."" Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal."
1691,"Oh, really, pregnancy is not expensive? Have you gone through a pregnancy? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies, and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits, to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands (tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth). Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive. As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it. If you think otherwise, you are sadly mistaken."
1692,"And I am going to say to you one more time, take a class, I am not going to give it to you. There are millions of fossilized links showing slow and obvious changes. Horse fossils show a very gradual evolution to what is today considered the horse (but oh wait you knew that since you studied evolution so well with such and open mind.) There is also this little thing called punctuated equilibrium where there is a sudden large change (usually thought to have been caused by mutation) But again, since you studied evolution you knew about that."
1693,So you admit that the bible should be kept out of the hands of children? Is my statement about the bible somehow false? Is the brutal torture and murder of Jesus not glorified in the bible? Is a book that glorifies this type of activity proper reading material for a 5 year old. i bet Rep. Sally Kern would gladly let a five year old read about the brutal torture and murder of Jesus.
1694,"So you agree that we should leave weather out of it and focus on healt care cost?All the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes i.e. longer life expectancy, fewer preventable deaths, lower infant mortality, in most cases more doctors per capita. They have lower cost in spite of the fact that the U.S. insurance companies insure only the healthy. Over there they treat the sick. What are the insuranc ecompanies doing with our money?? How come the small businesses, the self-emplyed are priced out of the market and left to die in pain??"
1695,"No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic."
1696,You mean you equate the Bible with your own theory?(which is lacking information).
1697,"And way too many of them. Of course what do you expect witht the state run media, a solid lock on education to the point of propaganda and massive voter fraud. They don't say the graveyards in Cook County IL vote early and often for nothing."
1698,"Yes, it is against the law in most states to do that."
1699,You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.
1700,"Some important concepts (and why the word no longer has meaning in biology) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve. Such concepts were discredited with Darwin. As is pointed out, opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with  creationism . While  creationism  is a belief in mythology based on no evidence, no one  believes  in evolution. Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution."
1701,"But there is no evidence that it did not come about by natural processes. And, there is, in fact, evidence of natural processes that may have resulted in life. Just because you don't understand it doesn't make it so."
1702,"Oh good grief!I have always lived in rough areas. In one city, Alburquerque, a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept, and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun.Where I worked, less than a block away, a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place.I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER, I didn't know the stupid beast, I was scared to death, but I felt it my Christian duty (even though I am not a Christian) to get the guy to where he could get treatment.And I don't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted."
1703,Well you've made a good point; just because something is banned or made illegal doesn't mean that it'll have an affect on reducing the numbers.
1704,"So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?"
1705,"Well Clive, I will formally invite them here........ I don't know if any of them will take my invitation seriously, but we will see."
1706,No country has removed automoblies after registration. Yet historically after total firearm registration confiscation has followed.
1707,"But, these are still males and females of the human species passing on their genetic capacity to reproduce themselves, which we know Gay folks cannot do in nature.  GL,  Terral"
1708,"Carmen, it's senseless not to believe that Abortion is Planned Parenthood's #1 reccomendation. Does Planned Parenthood offer pregnancy support? No. Do they offer ultrasounds? No. Do they have maternity wards? No. What do they do? They give out pregnancy tests and do abortions. That's where they get their money- a quarter of all their revenue is from pre 13-week abortions. This is not even countig their later more expensive abortons that are also so common! They get $40 million a year for abortions alone."
1709,"So-called Sartre, advanced Amercans were finally able to convince all those Southern states to raise the age allowable for girls being married. I think in most Southern states, it's at least 16, except that maybe backward Kansas still allows marriage at 14. And Kansas is a weird state."
1710,"I know a number of Christians who do actually stick to this belief.  And this one too (abeit watered down- having to wear a to church)  Goes to show just when you thought we had gone all progressive there are some people wanting hiding blatant sexism behind the veil of religion.  But with regard to your point I agree entirely- the bible is interpreted in different ways, depending on the person."
1711,"Well in the opinion of supporters of that theory there has been evidence for their beliefs... Visions, UFO's, ...  even though it is very doubtful, it would have to be respected in classes at school..."
1712,"Really? Then why haven't you condemned organizations such as the Brady Campaign? They continually put out the lie that the .50 BMG is capable of bringing down commercial planes as if the entire process was mere child's play, but there's absolutely not a shred of evidence to support this claim."
1713,NO NO NO gays should not be able to marry! I can not believe in how secular this country is becoming if we let gays marry it will ruin are tradition in this country because if we let this happen we will have let men to marry as many women as they want same goes for women do to the equal protection act. MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN 1 MAN AND 1 WOMEN PERIOD.  ps sorry for the caps
1714,And rightfully so. I'll prove it with the exact legislation.
1715,"Ah, this is a much better place to employ the sickle cell example. Also there are squillions of examples in evolutionary bacteriology."
1716,"And here you are, claiming that judge Urbina ruled favorably to either Heller or for the side of the Second Amendment Rights? He did not! He tried to muddy the water and preserve the status quo of the failed D.C. gun laws."
1717,Perhaps the best way to defeat Accipiter in a debate is to stay silent and watch him make fallacies.  Asking you questions about relativity seemed to effectively take you out of that debate but asking me questions has not.
1718,Evolution doesn't explain the event. The event is an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of alleles in a populatioin over time. The explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection. You merely asserted that based on your imagined case.
1719,"So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?"
1720,"1972 wasn't THAT long ago for some of us. Do you not think that many of those people who signed on are still alive and active in the gay rights movement?  And besides, why get so defensive about polygamy anyway? It's not like it's some horrible thing to be compared to."
1721,The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that.
1722,"I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal. What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be. However, I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away. Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago."
1723,"Walking-fish: Well, it's a darn good thing that they let that Tyrannosaur drown in the flood. If that thing ever got loose on the ark there wouldn't have been any animals or people left to repopulate the earth. It's a darn good thing, I say."
1724,I think you need to read the book of Job.
1725,"There is not one theory, but a great many to choose from.If you're talking about the origins of life, many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life.Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories, but there's a lot of cross-over; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup.Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design. They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means. (Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic, or materialistic processes)It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions; Panspermia, of which, his version just shifts the problem, rather than answers it. (see below under PANSPERMIA)Intelligent Design theorists suggest that some intelligence; possibly, but not exclusively a deity is behind nature; that nature seems to have an order. Some here too casually dismiss ID from science but the door's already open to scienceSETI looks for IDCryptographers do toForensic scientists doTHEORIES OF LIFE...PANSPERMIAPanspermia is the idea that life came from outer space. As with all theories this too is not homogenous. There's a general panspermia theory, and a 'directed' panspermia theory. The former is a belief that life came here by random chance, such as on a meteor. The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life.One idea is that the building blocks of life “...Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy.” http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html""Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth. This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled ""Directed Panspermia"" in a professional science journal called Icarus. A decade later Crick wrote a book, Life Itself, reiterating the theory; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book, Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable."" (Behe, M, ""Darwin's Black Box"", p238) which as I said, simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from?'""COMPLEXITY THEORY Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute, has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids), they were instantaneously integrated into a system, a system which we know as the cell (Cohen, 1996). Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance, but was bound to occur. He rejects other scientists' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA, or even an aperiodic solid, saying that the life forms may have had no need for them. (An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern, such as a helix, that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material). He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing. Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity, then they spontaneously form an ""autocatalytic set"" (a life form). His theory is based on the general complexity theory, which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity, it will naturally produce a degree of complex order (4).""http://www.lifesci.utexas.edu/cours...2/JENNIFER.htmlA. G. Cairns-Smith's Callisto Theory: That life began from a type of living-clayRichard Dawkins says of this ""Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates. If this is true, organic replicators, and eventually DNA, must later have taken over or usurped the role.""http://originoflife.net/cairns_smith/""Other TheoriesIn spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade, there is no true consensus theory for precellular life. There are many theories. Here are some of the others ?A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way (11). But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate. This is the chicken-and-egg problem. There is a ""proteins first"" school. For example, Manfred Eigen of Germany's Max Planck Institute says, ""There is no doubt that proteins, which are more easily formed, were first on the scene"" (11.5). Of course, these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today, because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids. Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin, one for metabolism (proteins) and one for replication (strands of nucleotides) (12). In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (13), A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed. A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder, ""Primordial soup or crêpes?"" (14). Even more recently, another tangent on this path leads to zeolite (14.5). Biologists Harold J. Morowitz (15), David Deamer (16), and others (17), advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as ""containers first."" Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in ""cold soup"" under the ice (18, 19). Chemists Claudia Huber and Günter Wächtershäuser say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot, probably, near undersea volcanic vents, where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions (19.5-19.7). Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper, in Earth's crust (19.8). Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, says, ""...whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules, a metabolism will crystallize from the broth"" (20). Another idea is the ""PNA world."" Because starting the RNA world is so difficult, there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world. PNA, or peptide nucleic acid, might have some of the properties necessary to constitute that world (21). This would be pre-precellular life.""http://www.panspermia.org/rnaworld.htmADDENDUMIf you're interested in aliens, check out ""The Science of Aliens"" by Clifford A. Pickover.

1731,"Except that we have a known causal link between human activity, greenhouse gases and temperature change. There is also the rate of increase that is unusual. If temperatures had risen over the last 10,000 years as quickly as they're rising now, the sea would pretty much have boiled.

1734,"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.htmlHere is a time line of hominid specieshttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.htmlhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.htmlEvolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well ""evolved"" depending on it's environment etc.A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp. Evolution doesn't lead to progression, but merely change. It's not getting better toward some high standard. Humans just like to think so."
1735,"Why is it you assume I'm doing nothing about it? Do you know how many charities I support which serve in Africa? The question is, what are you doing about it since it is only you whom you have complete control of. Think about actually contributing to programs like Doctors without borders rather than question my giving when it has already been proven on multiple threads that it is conservatives who contribute the lions share to charities in this country. All the liberals do is whine, complain and raise taxes so someone else will have to support their pet programs."
1736,"1.)Refusing to comment on scientific procedure means absolutely nothing. Maybe we don't have anything to say.2.)Testing your beliefs of your own scientific conclusions is not wrong.3.)I don't lie dude.4.)Because we don't give the response you would like is not wrong.5.)Don't think so.6.)The only thing classical ad-naeseum is your own preconceived idea's of creationism and creationist.You don't want to debate the issues like normal civil people, you just want try to make fools of creationists. Usually you're the one who start's the insulting. Your hatred is obivious and you're open to nothing. Just good 'ol boys patting each other on the back. I know this probably doesn't apply to everyone, there are some good guys out there. emoticonXAngel"
1737,just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.
1738,"So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.  You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions (a point I don't really care about) but unrelated to this topic...so if you want to talk about that, start another thread.  So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers?"
1739,"Well, its not just morally wrong in America, but its morally wrong in the middle east as well. And i think that if we continue our way downward morally as a nation, it would give terrorists even more hate for america because we are supposedly a ""christian nation"" and dont live morally.anyways."
1740,"Of course, this is because marc himself doesn't understand the alleged ""gaps."""
1741,"Anti-gunners don't care. They want ALL the guns not matter what is historically correct. Men who lived during the birth of this country were made of a much different metal than liberal anti-gunners today. What once considered a persons responsibility and own personal domain has been superceeded for  collective good  and what is  benefit to society . Never mind that democracy is fragile and that the majority of all living humans past and present has lived not as free men. Never mind that that those lessons and hard won freedoms are traded away for the convience of state care and protection. Yes horrific crimes are commited with firearms, but they are commited by evil men. Good and evil can be equally acomplished by a firearm. Never mind that evil men commit evil acts and good men can do good with the same firearm. What matters most to anti-gunners is that the evil and the good should be punished together for the common good of society."
1742,"And where exactly is your proof that  Stop, don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult  is indoctrination and translates to  go out and buy a gun, buy as many guns as possible, obsess over the gun, etc. "
1743,I need to pick you up on this as IC has never been identified. As such you cannot use it to 'prove' something incorrect.  I will respond to your other points but my wife insist I turn the laptop off.....
1744,"I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.  I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly. When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own. I'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting; I'll give it 100%.  But not yet.  Prototype:"
1745,Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood. Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash. Some people have been calling John Lott  the Bellesiles of the Right.  Read this article  The Bellesiles of the Right? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data.   http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/  John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan (Mary Rosh) to praise himself. That's intentionally trying to deceive people. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...&amp;notFound=true
1746,I need to pick you up on this as IC has never been identified. As such you cannot use it to 'prove' something incorrect.  I will respond to your other points but my wife insist I turn the laptop off.....
1747,I think the reason for the differences in translations is because the translations i think are geared more to audience. There are easier translations for little kids and those who have a hard time with bigger words. Another thing that has to be taken into account is that it is not always easy to translate exactly from one language to another. Some English words have several equivalents in other languages so the differences in the translations come from which equivalent was chosen by the translators.  P.S. This of course is not to argue with what the person stated above.
1748,"Yet Bush's military record is downright questionable, as well as his Saudi Links, not to mention his business failures."
1749,"Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods."
1750,"Reading Difficulties, huh?  There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there....."
1751,I just want to say that i am doing a paper for school also about abortion and until i came to this forum web site thing i didnt have enough information..  I just want to tell you thank you soooooo much jim's trucking for all those web sites you posted i know they were intedned for xbig_bootiex i just thought about checking them all out .... i cant thank you enough those web sites helped me out alot.. i dont know what i would do without this site literally once again thank you jim's trucking your an hehehehe
1752,"Perhaps the  atheist  orginizations are already busy dealing with problems such as AIDs, poverty and other such horrible dangers in other parts of the world.  Otherwise, this is really just a pathetic way to insult non-Christians."
1753,"Well, when we talk about rights as allowable behaviour, then yes we do have this right. And it doesn't end when it affects someone else.  GALTON:"
1754,"For the final compilation, yes, but the vast majority, certainly the Gospels and the first few Pauline epistles, were widely accepted long before that, and were regarded as authoritative in the early 2nd century. By all means quibble about 2 Peter, Hebrews and Revelation but don't try to claim the books of the Bible were selected politically in the 4th century, it simply doesn't fit the facts."
1755,You can't...only admin can...and there's no need to be sorry.
1756,"Well,  evidence  for an extraterrestrial creation isn't just through visions and people who have  seen  UFO's.  You forget  evidence  given by astronomes such as the people from SETI. (SETI is an organization founded after scientists have discovered a strange signal from outer-space. From there on the organization has developed very much)  The signal, the SETI people got showed the first three prime numbers. This is very strange because it has never happened before (the scientist who detected the signal, called it WOW-signal, because it was so strange)  This signal shows a major part of Design: Specification  But unfortunately, to show that it is really true, it is missing another part: Complexity  The signal is evidence, but unfortunately it is too short. If those scientists would detect a signal that shows the prime numbers from 2 to 101 it would meet both parts: it has specification and complexity...  The SETI people would party all night...  So these  theories  aren't as unproven as you think they are...  (I still don't believe it happened like that)"
1757,We can make machines that can interpret information that our unaided eye can't. They don't have to dismantle anything.
1758,"So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?  If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?  What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?  What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?  If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?  You are confusing me. Please explain."
1759,Notice how doctors determine if the body is empty.  Electrocardiogram or Electroencephlogram( looking for life force/electricity/energy)
1760,I think most people have the integrity to marry for love and no other reason.
1761,"Well, if you said  Look what I found, isn't that disgusting?  Or  Here's something truly controversial, what do you guys think  or basically anything that shows you were posting it merely for a discussion and that you weren't supporting its findings. Disclaimers are great things. You should try them. And"
1762,"Well, there's a little more to it since the courts ruled that abortions have to be carried out in the first trimester when the fetus is much less developed than one that could survive outside the womb (or  room  if you prefer)."
1763,And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function?? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function' that what matches with reality.
1764,"It will be a moot point once the California constitutional amendment gets underway.  13 states have already done it, all pretty recently."
1765,"Why is it when Creo's don't believe something, Evo's always think because they have studies or what have you that we Creo's have to accept it as proof. I mean you don't accept anything as proof from Creo's. If Creo's did some carbon testing and did it accurately and got some anomaly's, you'd still reject it. I didn't lie not even by ignorance. I just don't believe it's true, but I take it I'm not allowed my beliefs . What fact has disproved my worldview, my worldview is intact as it ever has been?"
1766,That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. And that is what I was getting at originaly. Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.
1767,"I'm the first! I'm the first!  This was an interesting idea that you had  the other day ? Something like that would have taken me a month or more to develop. Perhaps you were using a figure of speech.  I'm going to have to read it all again (without the single malt) to be sure, but I think that you presented a fair representation of IDCreationism and then body slammed and pinned it. Your piece was short but to the point.  In saying that you did present a fair representation of IDCreationism, you also managed to reveal a ruse of ID. XXXXXX presume that CSI is the result of specified complexity which is the result of design which is the result of an intelligent being. That's actually pretty meaningless. The source of the information in the genome of any organism is the environment in which it lives. If you have doubts, make a significant change to that environment. Put your tropical, fresh water fish into a salt water tank. Or do the reverse with your salt water fish.  Creationists of any ilk fail to understand the power of the environment in acting on genetic diversity over time."
1768,lets see im going to ask you some questions.  are you  ?  are you a   ?  do you have blue eyes?  do you have brown eyes?  now if you say NO to one of those things isnt that cosidered an answer? where i come from its yes or no.2 possible answers. not just yes every time to get what you want.
1769,Just because a woman is made to bear children doesn't mean she has some God given right to abort her child. I don't think you can support this view with God's word.  -theo
1770,Only in your mind.
1771,"The fear of God? What God? Only yours or any God? How about the fear of something greater than yourself? Would that be progress?I'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time. I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not. As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it. Based on the way you posted here, it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here."
1772,"Why would gun control measures like keeping a register of all the guns sold and who to permantly, or vetting people who buy guns beforehand be a threat to a law abiding citizen, all it will do is make investigations of crimes easier and make it that much harder to get guns for a criminal. I think that something similar to a driving test for firearms seems reasonable, make sure that people know how to safely store and use guns as well as making them feel safer using them.  I am curious how this makes me a communist though"
1773,"Walking-fish:  I basically agree with you. I guess I was being redundant in this regard. I was thinking out loud, in cyberspace. But it is interesting that we humans may be the first species to actually go beyond the need for this death &amp; reproduction cycle by genetically or artificially reinventing ourselves. But now I'm thinking out loud again on the web."
1774,Oh please... You just refuse to acknowledge anything of a victory for LGBT people.
1775,Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.
1776,"It is interesting to note that Genesis was debunked by scientists who were also creationists. Those creationists then began to babble about multiple, successive creations with Genesis being the last. Even worse, they also babbled about their god creating fossil evidence in order to test the faithful."
1777,And terrorists probably kill less people in the US than non terrorists. To even begin to make any kind of meaningful comparison you have to adjust for the fact that there are a lot more people who don't pack heat than those that do in the US.
1778,YOU ARE WONDERFUL!
1779,"And yet, in this case, your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage. And you aren't outraged by that? That's what I don't understand. The article focused on Palin 'needing to clarify', but didn't even take Biden to task for being against gay marriage!  I would think you'd want to know WHY he's against gay marriage. Particularly since he's your preferred candidate, and gay marriage seems to be a very important issue to you. But hey, maybe you don't care!"
1780,"You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote. Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.Do a find on, ""Hence it must be assumed"" to see the quote in context.Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read ""Origin"" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is ""artificial selection."" Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man ""...intentionally or by chance picked out..."" characteristics. Of course, by use of the word ""chance"", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally."
1781,"I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the pro-life argument relies exclusively on religious doctrine. I'm a Conservative and religious, but I think that abortion can be discussed without bringing religion into it. My personal opinion is it's a mistake for Pro-lifers to bring religion into it because it fuels the hatred of the God-less Left LMAO"
1782,"Yes, a guarantee that you can see a GP within 3 days (same day or even a home visit within the hour in an emergency) would be catastrophic, I can see that. And being seen in ER within 4 hours (for non-urgent cases) would be terrible."
1783,OS is so consumed with vitriolic hatred of me he is incapable of realizing that I did not start this thread.  The fellow who started it has been banned for his extreme anti-woman views.  Perhaps OS should be banned for his extreme anti-Simone views.
1784,I can see why you might ;) My apologies to chemists everywhere.
1785,"Pandion has already pointed out that this isn't a theory, it's a mode of wishful thinking. More damagingly, however, if you examine it for more than a moment it doesn't even fulfill the role you give it. You say 'many things in nature make no sense without God', but how do god's origins and nature make sense? Where did he/she/it spring from? All you do by invoking god as an 'explanation' is push the problems one step further back. The god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not."
1786,Well to be fair they do seem to have a problem distinguishing between armed and unarmed people. I recall an imigrant being shot 41 times with just some keys in his hand. Then there was the guy in the car shot while driving black.
1787,"So this list was a surprise to you? This isn't the first time that the ""challange to come up with one scientist who believed that humans do not share common ancestry with apes"" has come up on these forums. When refuted, the goal posts move, and it's shown how several scientists who don't believe in common ancestry are dwarfed by percentages of those who do, with of course, a dose of ridicule thrown in. Is that how students are sometimes ""educated"" in today's universities? A false implication is made to belittle creation as much as possible, and if not questioned, is quickly built upon? And if questioned, the goalposts are moved and the questioner is riduculed? "
1788,"How about the individual's offspring? Is a ""subtract 10 years"" gene encoded in the genome just because of one marriage?Still no evidence."
1789,Evidence? I didn't think so.
1790,"If you believe that it is the development of thinking ability that makes a human count as a life with rights, it seems reasonable to think that people with superior thinking ability would have superior rights."
1791,You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind.
1792,"an image is not the original. a photo of you is not you, its an image of you. the image cannot be or replace the original, and isnt intended toregardless of how ""perfect"" the photocopier is, you cannot cash the ""perfect"" copy of the check. it may be a perfect replica, to the detail, but it is still only an image. the problem isnt the quality of the copying process, but the fact that the copy itself is just that, a copy, not the original"
1793,"Your view of choice is your belief. I don't  believe  that a pregnant woman or anyone else should be able to choose for the child. That child does not have a choice. Choosing to kill someone is a choice, but it is not a choice that should be legal. Therefore, you are forcing your view of  choice  on me by making abortion (murder) illegal."
1794,"**  Not true. I most certainly do apply EAM to all empirical observations of biological originality, just to see if it still applies. To date, it always has. As for darwinian interpretations of that same evidence, presenting them and defending them is your responsibility, not mine."
1795,"Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional."
1796,"Yes, there is some disagreement on how to classify the fossils designated as H. habilis. What of it? Yes, there is disagreement on whether the specimens themselves represent a direct ancestor or a closely related side branch. What of it? The point is that these fossils are clearly intermediate in characteristics between modern humans and ancient apes. They do fit very nicely on the family tree, either on the direct line to humans or very close to that line."
1797,"Oh brother, here we go again. emoticon_frazzled"
1798,"And they have. The only reason you think a fetus is equatable to a human is because it is made of organic matter. What if there was a piece of cardboard in the mothers stomach? Its non-organic and is in the same mental state as an embryo (that is, no mental state). The only difference is the matter its made out of."
1799,"I'm sorry, this is pretty damn funny, coming from a pro-life person :p"
1800,"You praise my former country's health care plan, championing it over anything else America might have...and you don't even know whether or not they get sick pay from work?  First you praise Canada's system, even though it only applies to Canadian citizens and it's a three year wait to become nationalized. And now you're praising Britain and you don't get sick leave over there."
1801,So you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe its true! Get real baby even you don't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.
1802,"I seem to take a different approach to this objection than most people. The principle of NS is so painfully obvious that I have trouble understanding why people have trouble understanding it. For this reason, I can see how it does sometimes come across as tautologous. Two plus two may be four because we've defined two and four that way, but that doesn't make the equation untrue. Likewise, that those genes that help animals be better able to pass on their genes will be passed on more often (due to whatever specifics) is true regardless of objection. Whatever works, works. Those mosquitoes that aren't drawn to the zapper live; those that are die. Those animals that can withstand the frigid winter live; those that can't freeze. Why is this so hard to understand?Maybe I'm misunderstanding the objection?"
1803,"Well I suppose I could've always put up a sign that said ""Trespassers will be held with legal counsel, robbers will be shot, survivors will be shot again"" but you're just welcoming trouble with that."
1804,"yes, and i suppose an idea of perfection can exist, in a thinker's mind, and subjective to the thinker's standards of perfection. i could also point out that an imperfect thinker, with no reference or standard of  objective  perfection, is incapable of having a perfect idea of anything. therefore the argument falls apart at the first premise, since an  idea of perfection  cannot exist, unless the thinker himself is perfect, which would make him God by his own definition."
1805,"A Jungian might suggest such a stance. In other words, one (good) cannot exist without the other (evil).  I wonder what some of our more interesting christian friends (AA, GC) might have to say about such?"
1806,"Actually, there is. The naturalistic explanation is the only viable theory put forth. Out of all the other crackpot theories (they really aren't theories), this as well as later evolution are the only parsimonious ones.You use occam's razor to select the most parsimonious theory out of competing theories. You look at them and see which ones attempt to explain the same phenomenon, and then look to see how they do it. WHich ones assume something outside of nature? Paranomal? GOD! Not the naturalistic common ancestor/primoridal soup. THat's fully plausible, and natural.And natural selection isn't nebulous. Your ignornance of the subject obfuscates that judgement. It's been observed and there is more than adequate evidence for the vast majority of scientists."
1807,I don't agree with this either/or binary logic.
1808,"Foolish Clergymen.  How can this work? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart.  You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs. It simply must be all or nothing. Otherwise you are wasting your time."
1809,"Amusingly Kurtz, in his article, says:  More precisely, it has further undermined the institution. The separation of marriage from parenthood was increasing; gay marriage has widened the separation.   If gays aren't entirely responsible for undermining the institution of marriage, then who else is responsible?  Maybe it's those danged filthy asexuals..."
1810,"That happens, too. For example, our gene for vitamin C is broken and no longer works."
1811,"But can you answer simone or jito's argument's successfully and counter their posts? If you can't, then in essance, they won."
1812,But I'll bet that you don't know what any of them are.
1813,And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies.
1814,"Yeah. I did A-levels in both Biology and Chemistry, but I don't really have a clue what all that's about! I must admit that I have some issues with the BBC's termiology, but that's common. At least they try!"
1815,"And statistically a school massacre by someone with a concealed carry permit is just short of being nonexistent, but that fact still doesn't mean a thing to you."
1816,Based on what evidence can you make this conclusion?
1817,"A good strong padlock makes as much sense as any other argument.You leave your car locked up when unattended because you don't want others who are capable of using it to do so without your permission, surely a gun is no different?"
1818,"So, you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory? And is actually supported by evidence? If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility. The fact is, they have no credible evidence at all as the big bang is nothing more than a deduction based on theoretical mathematical equations which can neither be confirmed or verified. Just read the link and consider the factors cosmologists must consider before even doing the math required to come up with an age. Now consider how skewed the outcome must be if they are incorrectly interpreting even one aspect of the info they are relying on for the equations which result in an age.Any errors in those results and the out equations are useless. Thus, the 10 billion year gap in their cosmological guessing game.How Old is the Universe?Now consider the creator of the big bang theory itself. Edwin Hubble proposed the big bang as a possible beginning of the Universe based on the perceived expansion of the universe from a tiny central singularity back in 1929. Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began. http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htmThis theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which doesn't claim that God did it."
1819,"So, one set of creationists are XXXXXX, but the others are not?"
1820,"And who is the 'WE' that we trust? The scientists or the theologians, who disagree with each other?  I am curious for it on my own account.. and not willing just to accept someone's authority saying it happened one way or another."
1821,"Actually, it does no such thing. It merely means a secular moralist must justify moral codes on the basis of their intrinsic rationality and real world consequences, rather than appealing to a deity as an arbitrary authority. Since all the scriptures of the world have been written by people, this moral authority represents nothing more than their personal opinions about what they think their god wants."
1822,Evidence or proof for that delusion?
1823,"I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described."
1824,"Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.  We're waiting to hear about three or four more.  As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want."
1825,"Then that’s as far as we can go on it, and that’s fine. Not being a science worshiper myself, I simply don’t automatically take this type of blanket statement as automatically true. What largely prompted this thread happened last Tuesday - 6:30 AM, and a six-figure weather forecaster scientist guy assured everyone watching him that a pretty nice day was ahead, largely cloudy yet with peeks of sun, with a slim chance of very spotty rain. 2 hours later, the beginning of widespread heavy rain, for three solid hours. Unusual of course, but if we have scientific blunders concerning a few miles, I can imagine we could have a few blunders concerning hundreds of thousands of light years."
1826,I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?
1827,"Oh, you have a problem with Socialism? Is that so?"
1828,"In reality, UK cops carry batons as they always did. They wear stab-proof vests too. There are also specialist armed response teams, who carry arms in their cars, for possible use if necessary, supplementing and supporting the foot patrols, who can and do patrol alone. Don't believe everything you read."
1829,Did ya ever notice that the people who do the work which you always point out as being adverse to a particular scientific area are always people who are well trained in that area? Don't you see something of a contradiction in the idea that physicists would conduct work which cause physics to crash and burn??? And of course in this instance there is no crash and burn just an interesting new finding - which has yet to be confirmed.
1830,"So many errors, where does one begin? The entire specious claim that there are pygostylian Avialae which pre-date Archaeopteryx lithographica stems from Chatterjee's most dubious fossil, ""Protoavis texensis,"" and Confuciusornis sanctus, which was initially described as dating from Tithonian horizons of the terminal Jurassic--although subsequently Hou et al (1996) presented more conclusive evidence placing the confuciusornid material from the Barremian (much to the chagrin of Alan Feduccia, who made much of Confuciusornis being from the Jurassic). As for ""Protoavis,"" the holotype and paratype are almost certainly composed of material which is not conspecific, and the material seems to correspond to a coelophysoid/drepanosaur chimera (Paul 2002), or a coelophysoid chimera (Gauthier & Rowe 1990). As for the Eichstatt Conference. It hardly concluded that Archaeotperyx was a ""true bird,"" it concluded that as opposed to the hypotheses of some (e.g., Thulborn 1976), Archaeopteryx was indeed the most basal avialian, and not a less derived member of Coelurosauria. One would actually suggest referring to the published data from the conference, in Hecht et al 1985, before continuing to make such assertions.Vindex Urvogel"

1833,"Sorry my brain wasn't working that early this morning. What I was trying to say was I can't understand those who wish to completely take guns away from civilians. Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s, but if I want to own a pistol, a shotgun, and some fancy automatic, well that's my right."
1834,"As to the decline of moral fortitude in this country... these radical voices will do much harm to their standing socially. They are lashing out in angst at the root of their behavioral conviction not at all giving heed to the millions of voters who are not particularly religious, or gay [yes - gay voters voted for it as well] who understand the over arching significance of having a lifestyle ordinance enforced by the state, its just wrong and will do significant harm to the country if not put down. It is flatly flys in the face of what defines morally clear legislation and reveals nothing more than a social agenda wanting to force its lawlessness on the public in general. They were reminded that they are survived by the grace of these who live and let live, and may find themselves on even a shorter social rope if they don't ease up on their madness being projected at people who have done nothing to them... ever.  It will ultimately backfire on them... best be assured of that."

1837,I think that if for arguments sake that if Darwin was a racist that carried out genocides then I still don't see what Macroevolution would have to do with it. I will say it again. If you start with the mistaken belief some people are inferior then Eugenics immediately seems reasonable since it only relies on the idea that some people are inferior and the fact that parents are like their offspring.
1838,"The pro-life position isn't even formost about the law. It is about stopping abortions, period. That is why so many pro-life people work in counseling centers, not legal offices. Your implication that pro-lifers do not vary in their views is just plain ridiculous--I myself am living proof that they do. I am certainly pro-life, but I don't oppose very early term abortions or when the life of the mother is in definite danger."
1839,We've already been over this and again you're confusing two separate issues. I think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law.
1840,"Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in ""evolutin"" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith."

1844,"Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks."

1847,"Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the ""Cambrian Explosion.""51Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, ""... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.""51Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include ""a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.""38 Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But ""one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs."" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to ""the last filament of a trilobite's gill,"" or the last meal in a worm's gut.38The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, ""Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.""38The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38""The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time."" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College50Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”50 http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm"
1848,"Buying guns  Conditions under the 1999 Gun Act  To purchase a firearm in a commercial shop, one needs to have a Waffenerwerbsschein (weapon acquisition permit).

1851,So the fact that terrorists board airplanes should be used against people in determining whether they can be trusted or not? My government must not trust an ordinary dirtbag like me because it makes me go through a security check before boarding a plane.
1852,"Right. We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot investigate the supernatural by natural means. Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R. Miller for example."
1853,I think jyoshu has posted a BS meter which is pretty nice.
1854,"Of course. The Kellerman study points out that a firearm is 43 times more likely to be used on its owner than in self defense.This is why it makes perfect sense to hand all our guns over to criminals. We can then take them away using Kung Fu and use them against their owners. (According to Kellerman, we are guaranteed to be 43 times more successful that way.)"
1855,"So guns are more important than the safety of women? Then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?  So men love their guns more than women? Is that some kind of homosexuality? Ya know a gun is kind of shaped like, um, you know what. A gun does ejaculate in a sense."

Speciation does not require ""huge jumps in genetic shifts,"" whatever that means (another example of semi-literate English).

1860,"I'm unclear on the laws in Europe, where from what I understand this happened, but in the state where I live, if a baby is born alive, even during an abortion, doctors have the legal responsibility to do whatever they can to save the life of the baby, and they also have the legal obligation to save the mother's life, and when the baby doesn't have a chance for survival, they legally have try to save the mother.  Babies can not survive in the womb without amniotic fluid, and the longer they are in there with fluid leaking, the greater the risks to mother and baby. If fluid is leaking, they have to do something soon, either by inducing labor or performing an abortion, depending on how close to term the baby is, and it's chances of survival outside the womb."
1861,"For the record, to interested parties reading -- subscribers to evolutionary biology or creationism -- I subscribe to evolutionary biology and having that taught in the public school system.

Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18.

1870,"Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality.  My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say  Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this...   But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?"
1871,"You mean like this?Pleistocene or Ice Age mammals, such as mammoths and musk oxen, had been found in Lake Bonneville deposits along the Wasatch Front as early as the 1870s.

It protrayed atheists as lost from the true path. The reasons it gave for being atheist were they hadn't found god yet, and a tradgedy. What about logically thinking about it? And a RELIGIOUS STUDIES teacher says that atheism is just a phase? They also say atheism is the easy way out. I think it's easier to just believe in a god and be comforted. I'm not saying people do but I'd say Christianity is more of a quick fix than atheism. All you have to do is believe in god and you're safe for your life and afterwards. Most Atheists don't believe what they do just to rebel or haven't found God yet. Mostly it's because they realized that there is no logical proof (enough for them) that there is God.

1873,"I am against abortions past the first trimester (3 months) and that stage there isn't enough brains to even feel pain..Not connections.  Past 20 weeks and I have real issues with the procedure. The time limit to an abortion is 24 weeks, I'd like to see that backed off by 4 weeks.  I am pro-choice, but pushing into that 24th week gets way to human like and gray mater matters. Naturally there are exceptions in my mind regarding health risks and such."
1874,"Perhaps not,perhaps it should, if it can be shown there is no prior knowledge the two people have ever met."
1875,I think you should teach everything about pregnancy and sex. The problem comes in when no one takes your seriously. Abortion allows for a no consequence view on sex. It's like teaching the dangers of steroids in baseball yet the consequence is to take a 1 day class on substantive abuse if you get caught. Of course the rewards are much better. Same thing with attitude towards sex. If you have that fail-safe than the consequences really aren't too bad so preventing pregnancies becomes harder.

1879,"No. According to current cosmology, hydrogen atoms were able to form about 3 minutes after the big bang when the background radiation fell to a level below that of the binding energy of atomic nuclei. During this period the synthesis of several light nuclei occurred - hydrogen, deuterium (heavy hydrogen), helium, and lithium.In fact, we don't know what caused the big bang. Our physics doesn't seem to apply to conditions before about 10^-43 sec after the big bang. There is some speculation about quantum events, but nothing solid yet. When the big bang was first proposed by a Jesuit priest, Einstein rejected it. Einstein ""believed"" in a steady state universe. Only after Hubble demonstrated that the universe was expanding did Einstein accept the idea of a point origin for the universe. The Pope called the big bang the moment of creation."

1882,so what if flagella parts are effected by a change of genes?....so are fly wings. The challenge was to present me any evidence that mutations can actually create new raw material for selection. You have to get out of the swamp somehow.  I think this concept of mutations as being creators has gotten a pass for too long now.
1883,No surprises that an unemployed former public servant would support increasing the amount he leeches off everyone else.  It's a joke this is even something people would think about at this point. The titanic's sinking and you're thinking about whether to ask for a room with lilac lampshades.
1884,"And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?"
1885,"Well, that was badly stated. But we've been over this before and you still don't seem to grasp. No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil. However, given the nature of life that we do observe, where we can see many species of equus, 36 species of cat, 28 species of canid, 8 or 10 species of bear (with as many more extinct species), 850,000 species of beetle, and on and on, we conclude that life was similar in the past. And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics, we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds. But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics, just like there are many animals with cat-like features. Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion. So we don't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism. But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form. Thus, Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact, is is believed to have eventually gone extinct (in all three known species). What we do say is that Archaeopteryx shows characteristics of both theropod dinosaurs and birds. Is in one of a broad lineage of many species with such characteristics, at least one of which is ancestral to modern birds (but we can't determine which one or ones that might be).And we haven't even gotten into the question of derived morphology. Why don't we assume that dogs are descended from some very dog-like artiodactyl? In fact, why do we conclude that these dog-like animals are, in fact, artiodactyls?"

1889,They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.
1890,Under the illogical view of the 14th amendment that currently occupies our court system there is nothing more about it than convincing 5 judges that it isn't immoral. Let's not pretend this is anything related to what the amendment actually says because we both know it isn't.
1891,"Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that."
1892,No. Monkeys are modern animals. Our closest living primate relatives are the chimpanzees. We share a common ancestor with them about 5 to 7 million years ago.
1893,"Iraq, one of the most heavily armed countries in the world, is believed to harbor enough guns to arm every one of its 24 million citizens. Iraqi civilians also have access to other light weapons, such as rocket- propelled grenades, mortars, and bombs - making their arsenals potentially more deadly.In the absence of a governing force in Iraq, some Iraqis are looking to increase their personal weapons caches in order to protect themselves from looters and roving armed gangs; others want small arms to conduct illegal activities and gain political power. Reports have surfaced that gun merchants have set up shop on the streets of Baghdad, selling AK-47s for as little as $10.""War ends, but Iraq battle over small arms just begins | csmonitor.comIn this thread I was told that handguns were useful in combating tyranny-http://www.4forums.com/political/gun...-relevant.htmlSo I'm supposed to believe that handguns are useful in battling tyranny but not having numerous amounts of the above weapons? Shows how inconsistent people can be when it serves their agenda."
1894,"Way to miss the entire point, Clerisian. My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women, and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed. Wishful thinking by a midtwenties female who just went through the most horrifying experience of her life, forgive me if I didn't clarify well enough.I can't imagine that anyone would disagree with that."
1895,And the answer is: we don't know. Maybe it came from nowhere. Maybe it was created. We don't know.
1896,"I think we should argue that it's time to stop making people easy targets. The reason so many people are getting killed and victimized is because there are too many laws against self-defense, giving too much power to those that are fully intent on doing harm in an illegal manner."
1897,"Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis &amp; Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine)."
1898,"The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves."
1899,"I understand that the position is commonly called  Pro-life.  However, pro-life should not just concern abortion. Pro-life should be about safe sex, peace, stem cell research, exercise, healthy eating and pollution control. As of yet, I've never seen a Pro-life rally against obesity -- which kills more than any abortion clinic. It truly is  Anti-Abortion  and some can argue that it is  Anti-Choice.  The reason it's not call anti-anything is because the prefix  anti  implies a negative, and all of our connotations make it a bad thing. No one wants to be anti-choice.  And seriously, other than people who directly profit from it, who is  pro-death?   As for the original post, it seems that story is more about some African women not knowing how to deliver babies, or prevent them."
1900,"Its entire history makes it racist. From the time it was used to keep guns out of the hands of the indians, to when it was used to let the police strip blacks of their private weaponry. You can't deny the facts."
1901,"The evidence shows that reptiles did give rise to birds, but nothing shows monkeys became humans. Monkeys are far to evolved in their own way to give rise to us."
1902,"Do you really think Obama gives a damn about the kind of economic destruction any sort of gun ban will have? No! He doesn't care, and neither does the liberal controlled congress that wants guns banned! They don't care if a billion people die, all they want is all guns gone! I've seen the memo.  Right now I want to tie a shovel to a tree branch."
1903,"So if it can be operated by means other than human control, are you saying a dog can operate it, maybe a monkey, thats something we see everyday. You are trying to split hairs Penfold, for a gun to be fired weather robotically, or training a primate to fire one still requires human intervention, so stop acting stupid because you are not stupid."
1904,"that is not true. a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural. an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal. the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed, just that they defy physical law. the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven"
1905,"I know a number of Christians who do actually stick to this belief.  And this one too (abeit watered down- having to wear a to church)  Goes to show just when you thought we had gone all progressive there are some people wanting hiding blatant sexism behind the veil of religion.  But with regard to your point I agree entirely- the bible is interpreted in different ways, depending on the person."
1906,"I believe that anyone should be able to choose death at any time. If a criminal asks for the death penalty, give them a psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental state. If they are sound of mind, them give them their wish. It saves time, money, resources, and is the ultimate prevention of recidivism."
1907,"What part of the Christian worldview? A part of the Christian worldview says stealing is wrong, so you must mean stealing is good? A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?"
1908,"Thanks for clearing that up. Studies already show that younger Americans are more supportive of gays and lesbians, even when it comes to marriage. Actually, as foundit has pointed out, a majority of Americans already favor gays serving openly in the military. President Bush speaks so much about  the will of the people , but ignores them when it comes to the military policy towards gays. Change will happen, I just wish it were sooner, rather than later."
1909,"You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools. Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation. A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that  theory . That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis.  Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out."
1910,And that is why they are wrong. They don't understand science. Science is not the presentation of proof but explanations of the evidence that have been tested.
1911,Qualification: Do the proponents of  safe sex  for teens with condoms and contraceptives support or oppose laws regarding statutory rape?  You are probably right in that this may not exactly fit with the abortion forum but it may be closely related.
1912,"Yep, homosexuals join to practice a religion that hates them just so they can gain access to children. I mean, so much for joining any of those adult dating services...I suppose becoming a priest is much easier.When will Christians such as yourself learn to stop spinning the story for your own hate agenda upon gays? Have you ever heard of accountability? "
1913,"Well, I thought I did. Perhaps you didn't understand.We can look at the rings of a tree to determine how old it is. We can also determine other things, such as relative lengths of growing seasons and times of catastrophies. If I were to cut down a tree just after it was ""created,"" I would be able to infer a growth pattern and relative seasonal information.. even though there was no growth pattern and there were no seasons.In the same way, if we look at a star that is 10 billion light years away, we are seeing the events that happened at that star 10 billion years ago.If this creationist ""response"" is correct, and the light we see didn't originate 10 billion years ago, what is the light telling us? It's telling us a story of stellar events that never happened. That's like writing a history book about events that never took place... Or at the very least, that would be like someone reading my daily journal of the events that took place in my life millions of years before I was born.Unless you can explain why we would see this false information, this response leaves you stuck with a trickster God.Moreover, true to SkepticGunt's word, this view is unscientific because it is completely unfalsifiable. ""Because that's how God made it"" is not a scientific claim."
1914,"You want to consider a ZEF a 'person' - fine, let's apply this so-called 'logic' across the board. If a woman should for whatever reason die while giving birth, then the baby should serve a life prison sentence for murder emoticon_xgood   Have a nice da"
1915,Because you are disrupting social order and infringing on another person's rights.
1916,"I see that you fail to see the logic that the less dominant Siamese twin ALSO has a right to their own body. One is not supporting the other - they are supporting each other so their rights are equal. Besides, both have a mental existence so, at least for me, abortion (or, in this case, one being killed for the rights to body of the other) would not be allowed."
1917,"marc says some pretty ridiculous things on a regular basis here, but this one's gotta be in the top ten. To think that there were no arguments for atheism or against theism before Darwin is the height if philosophical ignorance. After all, when I tried to engage marc in a discussion totally independent of evolution -- morality -- he ran."
1918,Abstinance?! Heaven forbid. emoticon_xangel
1919,"So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?"
1920,"Should it be legalized? Only if every other country did it  Is it harmful? Yes more so then moderate alcohol use and worse then smoking  Should it be taxed once legalized? Yes.  Should laws still apply to it, such as DUIs and the like? Yes."
1921,"yes, and we could regress infinitely here. i'd say well they developed from basic nervous cells near the skin surface, and youd say  well where did the nerve cells come from  etc etc. ulimately, we'd be back to square one: either they evolved from simple dna-type acid chains, or poof god did it. the existence of eyes actually doesnt make a great case for either argument"
1922,Because conservatives take pleasure in people suffering.
1923,Just wondering if you are going to respond to the OP (as it was addressed to you to help you to understand something).  If you ask me I'd just ignore the negative comments that some posters make toward you. Just focus onexplanations of misunderstandings and constructive criticism.
1924,"But only true love is not involved. There is the matter of a legal contract.  Also, a child is not a consenting adult."
1925,"I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal."
1926,"There's a difference between these tests.Accipitridae, (and you by implication that you've not picked it up and called him to task) are mixing up the ancestory of individuals - giving a list of every single member of a family, to that of a species by species account. The difference is both of scale, and testability; written records aren't as long lasting as biological ones. You should be able to use science for whole species ancestory; after-all scientists can tell us with confidence that chimps are near relations, gorillas relations a bit further removed etc. Or, should we question those that tell us chimps are near relations?"
1927,The burden of a pregnancy is the woman's. It should be left up to her and her doctor to decide what is best for her.
1928,"oh don't kid yourself, you people were miserable long before I got here. Darwinists' arrogance is astounding."
1929,"And that remark is relevant because? Just to inform you once again, the word is ""stasis."" You make yourself look ignorant and foolish when you can't even spell correctly. However, stasis is the norm in a stable environment. The reasons are simple. Organisms tend to become well adapted to a stable environment. As Richard Dawkins would explain, they tend to become adapted to a particular nich in a particular environment, and when that environment undergoes rapid change, they go extinct. The fossil record is full of such examples. Dawkins used the analogy of climbing a mountain of adaptation that made it impossible for the organism to cross to the peak of the new environment. Try reading ""Climbing Mount Improbable"" for an understanding."
1930,Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of  arms  include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case.
1931,"Actually in Australia it's der... people used to say  Well der Fred  (didn't matter if you were called Fred).  But no, other than that I had nothing to say. Why? Do you want me to?"
1932,And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
1933,"Well,  evidence  for an extraterrestrial creation isn't just through visions and people who have  seen  UFO's.  You forget  evidence  given by astronomes such as the people from SETI. (SETI is an organization founded after scientists have discovered a strange signal from outer-space. From there on the organization has developed very much)  The signal, the SETI people got showed the first three prime numbers. This is very strange because it has never happened before (the scientist who detected the signal, called it WOW-signal, because it was so strange)  This signal shows a major part of Design: Specification  But unfortunately, to show that it is really true, it is missing another part: Complexity  The signal is evidence, but unfortunately it is too short. If those scientists would detect a signal that shows the prime numbers from 2 to 101 it would meet both parts: it has specification and complexity...  The SETI people would party all night...  So these  theories  aren't as unproven as you think they are...  (I still don't believe it happened like that)"
1934,"Well is this serious science or is this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street?Am I just supposed to play make-believe and/or use my imagination? I can do that -- for instance, when I play with my kids, I'm real good at playing the role of ""Ken"" when we imagine that ""Barbie goes to the beach"" Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not.I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge called The Myths of Evolution. He says the following about gradualism: ----------------------------------------Change in this manner (gradualism) is just not found in the fossil record. pg. 48Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured. pg. 52Darwin's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual, progressive change in the fossil record was faulty. pg. 53As we have seen in the previous chapter, the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual, steady process of adaptive change. And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view. pg. 57We're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence. pg. 57------------------------------------I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate. It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed. (do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring?) It seems butterflies have this same ability.....Evolution sure is amazing!For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.""Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,"" she saidhttp://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htmWhere can I find an explanation about this phenomenon? Does Darwin talk about this? This is fascinating to me....I can't seem to find anything about this at TalkOrigins."
1935,I believe he said 100 percent of the time...........The difference between pro life and pro choice/abortion people is we have a wider tent........With you pro abortion/choice people its just kill the baby no matter what..........
1936,"You gather information from other forums, then use it as bait on yet another forum? Exactly how many forums do you belong to? I would hope you wouldn't be too surprised that others sometimes ignore you. Is this your main activity in life?"
1937,I see you are willing to violate my constitutional rights yet you expect someone else to do your dirty work.... How typical.
1938,"Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done emoticonXHoho"
1939,Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???
1940,"Global warming is predicted to cause extremely hot summers and extremely cold winters as it reduces the heat transfer capacity of the oceans. Thus, the extremely cold winter last winter was entirely within the model. Furthermore, the early blizzard is a known phenomena that occurs in the Mid West. Please try again."
1941,"And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a  high powered rifle  despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?  And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!  Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics."
1942,"But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the ""vapor canopy"" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth. "
1943,"Well, maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle, what do you need an automatic weapon? Have the deer gotten faster?"
1944,AND post an unprovable quote:  http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndfra.html  David Kopel puts Burger's words in the proper context:  Warren Burger Second Amendment
1945,"But you are using the word theory incorrectly. Since part of your discussion purports to be about science, one might make the mistake that you are using the word ""theory"" with a scientific connotation. You are not. What you are talking about is folk mythology, not theory."
1946,Ted Kennedy was on the no fly list or in other words a terrorist. How he got there was not known. It took him with all the weight he had a struggle to get off. Weasel hole out of that.
1947,"Evidence isn't peer reviewed.(*-see correction below)  Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what's peer reviewed.  And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't  proven  anything.  The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.  Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered.  The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.  There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians."
1948,"You know something, I just came here to browse, but upon discovering that you feel that people who believe in God are stupid, and their beliefs are stupid, just ###### me off. Not that you dont believe, but your use of the word stupid. I happen to be one of those stupid people you refer to, and so I will say this- People can say or believe whatever they want to, but we are all going to die one day, and something will be waiting on us when we do die, so before you start calling people names, I would explore the possibility that maybe christians are right, because in the inescapable end, we will all find out. And if we as christians are right, your eternal future dont look to good. And one more little thought, people thought the guy who said the world was round was stupid, but he was right in the end."
1949,"i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled"
1950,"Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that.  Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states.  And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court."
1951,"Well, I'm not sure if he consumed alcohol or not, but his doctor gave him daily  vitamin  shots that contained vitamins as well as amphetamines and maybe other drugs that doctors at the time thought were mentally beneficial.  And I've never heard of him being a vegetarian.  I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite, but I don't think they mentioned his being a veggie."
1952,"But it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is."
1953,"As I said earlier, it is garbage. He can't back it up. As a scientist-in-training, you know that real science requires research and evidential support. supersport has neither. The ""support"" that he cites -- when read in their entirety -- do little or nothing to actually support him. On one forum (mentioned earlier on this forum), the author of the scientific paper that supersport cited actually joined the board to tell supersport to stop misrepresenting his research.The only ""agenda"" that the scientific community has is to find the truth. The fact that the scientific community trounces supersport's points nonstop is not what makes his points wrong; his points are wrong on their own merit, and they'd be wrong regardless of anybody's refutations of them."
1954,So your point is that there are a lot of stupid people out there?
1955,"In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole  let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it  mentality...."
1956,You mean he does not agree with your view of christianity.
1957,"I know very little about evolution, but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes, so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape. Instead, I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor, but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago. Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me, since I said, I am by no means an expert on evolution."
1958,so a person that doesnt want children to have machine guns and 50caliber weapons is an antigun extremist? Id hate to know what you think a moderate is.
1959,"Actually, the one I find the most interesting is that 73% in Colorado voted AGAINST an amendment stating that life begins at conception."
1960,"Armed does include knives, axes, clubs etc!"
1961,"Clearly, he can't."
1962,"Chalk it up to the fact that -- although not all the time -- a good part of the time, the same people are pretty anti-anything education. We shouldn't expect them to argue positions that make sense."
1963,"Actually, I can not accept that claim. Before then, the absolutely youngest ever surviving fetus was deliver at 19 weeks, 6 days. 12 weeks would be a worldwide sensation. I would recommend that you double-check your source. Viability is still defined as the age at which 50% survive, which still is at around 24 weeks gestation/26 weeks pregnancy."
1964,"A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one."
1965,"Really, I am not posting much information.  For example, recent events such as the resistence of Chile to Europeans of UNO, the division of the political party PRI in Mexico, due to abortion topic, etc., etc., have not been posted here.  I have posted mainly some information about women imprisoned recently for abortion.  It is important to spread that information because women impunity is a weak point of pro lifers."
1966,What does this have to do with what you started out with. Can't you at least pick a topic and stick with it? You wander all over the place and only demonstrate you problems in understand written English. Get an education.
1967,If they're voting then they should be paying taxes too. There's no excuse for those lazy stiffs to avoid being miserable along with everybody else. Nobody ever said that taxes had to stop just because you do.
1968,"Most of them happening in the inner cities of Illinois, New York and California - states where the restricted access of firearms is supposedly designed to keep acts like these from happening.Who's the real traitor in this case; Obama for not passing your gun control package? Or the black guys that feel the need to kill their fellow black men for whatever reason motivates them?"
1969,"We already have such laws, where the straw purchaser is supposed to get ten years in prison for committing a straw purchase for somebody else."
1970,"C.S.Lewis believes things on faith, yet we are to use his words, which he is not here to clarify, as evidence that my claim is false, when he obviously accepts the same illogical claim as premise? His use of the word accident can readily be replaced by ""the natural laws of the universe"", or other more descriptive terms, without the negative connotation that seems to scare believers. ""We're an accident? OMG, then we must right!""."
1971,"Not global warmings existence, global warmings CAUSE. Does it come as a shock to you that the cause of global warming is controversial?  http://www.canadafreepress.com/2007/...ming020507.htm  There was also a piece of a formal debate about it on these forums. It was so lopsided, the global-warming-is-caused-by-man advocate fled the debate halfway through."
1972,Actually the bible is silent concerning abortion which is odd considering it was highly outlawed by surrounding nations.The bible is very clear concerning the value of a fetus as opposed to an actual soulish being(mother) though.
1973,"But the difference is, if you take a swing and hit someone, or harm them in a worse way, you can get locked up for it. But no cop is going to bar the door to a chapel where you get married to a same-sex partner, and you won't be arrested afterwards. Yes, it's completely legal for you to do that, right now.  Apples and oranges."
1974,"addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter.  if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails"
1975,"Yes, exactly, lions/sea otters/seals/manatees/whales. Note that these creatures do not fit in a continuum of animals.The rest of the post seems irrelevant to the question of this ""continuum"" prediction. If I am wrong, then you may clarify this. Otherwise, I see no reason to complicate this line of argument with side issues."
1976,"I believe science can indeed tell us when it cannot be considered a ""person"" as we define a person legally. No mental existence for the simple reason that the hardware has yet to form. Protecting ""potential"" persons is beyond the scope of our Constitution IMO."
1977,"Whenever you say, ""tsk tsk tsk"", I know you got nothin'.:p"
1978,"A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon.The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.""In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'""The News regrets the error.""CORRECTION"
1979,IF you keep it. ;)
1980,"No, she misrepresented studies and took statistics out of context. Very right-wing. She asked how we would feel if we were killed. The fact that we have consciousness, awareness of ourselves(sentience) makes us different from the fetus during the level of development when the vast majority of abortions occur."
1981,"1. I consider my arguments to be ""anti-elective abortion"" not ""pro-life."" And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two. ""Pro-lifers"" approach the abortion debate from an ""all life is sacred"" generally religious based point of view. I do not. I neither believe that ""all life is sacred"" nor that ""god"" or religion should be used in the debate at all.2. My argument that a ""human individual's life biologically begins at conception"" is not an ""assumption."" It's is a conclusion reached by an indepth study of the facts and references available."
1982,"Doesn't count. Took place in a ""gun free zone"". By law no guns are allowed there, so by law this incident couldn't take place."
1983,Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white.
1984,"Yes, I believe there will be a lot more to come (as you said, just look at the  hobbits  that were recently discovered). I love this sort of look into the migrations of everyone over the last 160,000 years or so."
1985,"HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is. 6) And the standard ""theistic evolution"" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it."
1986,"Liberals were responsible for things like abolition of slavery and women's suffrage that overturned the oh-so-traditional status quo. Now we're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill, reasonable gun control, access to abortion and contraception (without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members)... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world? No, but things like slavery, sexism, rampant crime, and politicization of private issues are."
1987,I believe prochoice people support choice.   I don't know what proabortion people support. I've never met one.
1988,"this is not true. the intangible, such as time, ideas and emotions, are just as real to atheists as anybody else. atheists dont subscribe to a spiritual realm, but that doesnt mean they dont agree on the existence of the non-physical. there is a difference"
1989,"Well earlier you seemed interested in the idea that a loophole might exist that allowed people to avoid taxes. In this case I was only suggesting that a loophole could exist which allows companies to save money by hiring gay people instead of straight people in order to cut health insurance costs. As I said, it isn't really a strong argument, but maybe an interesting one."
1990,"Doesn't matter if it is 5 months or 8 months (all of which is done) or 1 month...it is a person inside another...why does that make a difference? I suppose you are a ""cancer"" too? So I guess we assume you comment should read "" Her body her choice so long as she is not inside another person and none of anyone elses business."" Surely is a random thought but I would like to have one of my own. I think that if I kill someone else in my own home then it is no one elses business but my own. Sound weird?? I agree...just like your statement."
1991,"Indeed it does. It tells me that we are learning that some genes are more important than others, and that mutations to HOX genes, and other regulatory genes are significant."
1992,The issue is about you linking an incident where a pregnant woman had so little regard for her unborn baby that she picked a fight with the police and somehow use it to demonise the police and the pro life people.  I could not imagine anyone could be stupid enough to do this without the aid of strong drink but thank you for reminding me that you can do it easily.
1993,"Oh, it's politics! [Slapping forehead with hand] What was I thinking?? If I find any KKK members are against relaxing drug laws, I guess I'd better change my view and start opposing drug laws. And if I happen to find that there are KKK members who don't mind U.S. involvement in the UN, I'll be sure and oppose any U.S. involvement in the U.N. I wonder if any of them have parents on medicare? Doh!! Guess I better oppose any form of socialized healthcare! emoticonXRolleyes"
1994,"Didn't supersport openly admit he could not prove his own beliefs in divine creation?   For all his dishonesty, you have to admit he's more honest and forthcoming then Marc or AA have been."
1995,"Not necessarily. It depends on a lot of conditions. If an organism falls in an anoxic environment, it may be fossilized. Sometimes they are buried quickly. Sometimes not. For example, the bottom of the Solnhofen lagoon about 140 to 170 million years ago was anoxic. Today, the bottom of the Black Sea is anoxic.You don't explain why a bone has to be under pressure. I thought it was mineralization that made the fossil.And so what? You seem to be claiming that there aren't any fossils. You can't be that dense, can you? What are those things that you find in museums of natural history?"
1996,"What should be practical in society is the criminal element being scared to death that they're going to be killed at the very next house they try and rob. That's not only practical, it's moral. If you don't want to die, don't break the law. It's not rocket science, all you need to do is stop being bad."
1997,"The last Pope stated evolution was compatible with the Catholic faith as well, however he supported the theory with a twist. I believe he said that evolution happened until roughly 6,000 years ago and then God intervened, creating Adam and Eve. Thereby attempting to nullify the fact we are descended from other animals.  Does this new infallible Pope agree with the previous infallible Pope?"
1998,"What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality? The definitions were accurate. It would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation. How about some evidence to support the ""theory.""By the way, I'm still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed. What you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under ""evolution,"" wasn't it?"
1999,"Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always.  In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves.  Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases."
2000,"...and I wasn't disappointed :)I don't know what 'chance as causality' is supposed to mean, but to speak of evolution being 'based on chance' is highly misleading.If I have an accident on the way to work tomorrow morning, there will be a definite cause; a specific series of events leading up to it. We cannot guess what they might be. Nevertheless, we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring, yes? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll, that if my number comes up, I crash, with 'chance as causality'? Of course not. We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge. As our knowledge of the system increases, our assessment of that likelihood changes: if you know my age and gender, my driving habits, my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds. If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system, the odds would be 1 or 0.Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA.Correctly viewed, evolution is not a series of unlikely events, but a series of highly likely ones. It is highly likely, for instance, that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon. Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities, but why stop there? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium, per-microsecond basis? The chances just got even smaller! See? It's a silly way to think about it, because in the end it's the chance of the event occurring that matters, not some arbitrary deadline by which it must occur or cell to which it must occur."
2001,"Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.Statis is the norm not the exception.One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?"
2002,"Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing."
2003,"Because they don't morph. But on the other hand, speciation has been observed. We have seen hawthorn maggot flies speciate several times as additional suitable plants have been introduced to the U.S. We have seen strains of laboratory flies speciate several times such that none are able to interbreed with the parent species anymore. We have observed two species of gulls that share a common range and do not interbreed, except that they are the extreme ends of a single population the encircles the world."
2004,Perhaps Jitobear would like to write this person a letter stating she supported her mothers choice to end her life.  If she could go back in time and given the chance I wonder if she would make sure the job was finished.
2005,"The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary."
2006,"Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?"
2007,"I wonder why you keep posting these pointless threads. This statement is beyond idiotic. No, that is not why we're pro choice, at least not all of us."
2008,"Yes, it does have value only if the woman wants it, in the early stages, when it doesn't have sentience, only potential and DNA. Because then it has value only because of a woman's wants and choices and her dreams for the future. Nothing else gives it value."
2009,"You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be.  This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs."
2010,"You hit the nail on the head there. Go to a shooting range or gun shop some time, and ask who of them is willing to pull their gun and start shooting at the slightest provocation. If someone is stealing my car, I am not going to shoot them over it. Even if I had the loaded gun in my hand. If someone is threating em or someone else, they are getting at least one wherever i find it convenient. Maybe if the media would stop bothering everyone with how dangerous assualt weapons are, people could learn the facts. Again, go into any guns hop. Ask which is deadlier, a .223 fired out of an 'Assault weapon' or the Garand chambered in .30-06 sitting next to it."
2011,"It's like the theory of the moon. We don't know how the moon was created. Captured asteroid, knocked off in a big collision, formed from dust at the same time earth did? We're not sure. But the fact that we aren't sure of the details of how the moon was created in no way casts any doubt on the existence of the moon.We know evolution is a fact, that's certain. Some of the details we're still learning. Which forms of selection are the most important in what situation, enviromental factors influencing gene expression, the importance of cues picked up pre-nataly. These are all open questions. The fact that we have these questions in no way casts any doubts on the veracity of evolution, it just means that there's still more to learn. That's something that SS doesn't get. If answers don't come 100% complete and tied up with a pretty bow he wants nothing to do with them."
2012,haha...I'll remember this next time I think of accusing you of spitting in one direction :p
2013,"I think we are talking about different things. A belief in adam and eve is not the same as being a good christian. The disbeleif in adam and eve cannot DIRECTLY be used as a excuse to murder. Also did hitler talk about anything else other than keeping bloodlines pure? Because these ideas to rely on the main theme of darwins origin of the species, in your quote you show how darwin states that eugenics is just an obvious consequence of the facts of animal husbandry."
2014,"1. Quoting a lie is still a lie. In concerns of war, information like this that is used this way should be double- and triple-checked.  2. Maybe the Taliban are gone but vast parts of Afghanistan are still ruled by warlords and for the people there the difference is rather small and irrelevant.  3. .Good one."

2017,"Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking."
2018,"That statement exposes your ludicrousy. First, you say you're against killing children who don't have a chance. Then you say the death of the Kurds and the WTC mean nothing to you. What chance did the children in the gassed Kurdish village have? What chance did the children in the WTC Day Care Center have?"
2019,"Is there a defined number of posts he could make in the other threads so that you would consider them ""finished""?"
2020,"I guess we just have different approaches then. To me a candidate should be held to questioning and challenged about any public policy issue, even publicly, rather than put a 'team mentality' first and not challenge them on a stance because of already wanting them in office--I tend to decide whether I want someone in office AFTER doing those things rather than before, and let such challenges play a part in whether or not I put my support behind them. An election is the time one SHOULD challenge them, not after they're in office and there's nothing that can so easily be done about it."
2021,Looks like dancing in the blood of innocents to me.
2022,"For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all."
2023,"How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by  less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined."
2024,good thing this argument has never been done!...oh wait.  With that logic we should make everything legal. You are much better off making theft legal and safe (no more guns needed!) than to have it illegal and dangerous.
2025,"I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be  leaving  at all. You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with.  Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge.  Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate.  --Chuz"
2026,"You're saying it's impossible to take marriage out of the government? Give all people currently married a civil union, and let people from now on get a civil union from the government, and marriage from the church. It really wouldn't be that hard."

2028,"My point is the embryo and zygote have potential to think. Their brain activity (none) is completely normal for their stage of development. Infants don’t know much, but their brain activity is normal for their age. It doesn’t make them less of a human because they think less. "
2029,"End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea."
2030,"I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms. While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot. A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard."
2031,"To you, it may be an incorrect statement. But if it is, you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote. Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. Injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it."
2032,"I did. You did not, and you did not read context. My response was based on the Chihuahua/Great Dane remark. Your source says they have the same basic set of genes. This is not the same as saying that all genes are the same.You go on to say, ""Their size and shape obviously have nothing to do with genetics,"" and imply that this is all phenotypic plasticity. Put your money where your mouth is, bub: Invest in a pedigreed Great Dane and a pedigreed Chihuahua. Breed them each to a pedigreed member of the same breed (i.e. GD × GD and Chihuahua × Chihuahuah, not inter-breed mating). Raise them in identical environments. According to you, all the offspring should have the same phenotype. Publish your results. You'll be rich.Go ahead. It should only take a few months. Again, you'll be rich. What are you waiting for?"

2035,"Exactly, which brings us back to square 1. Creationism is based on religion, and Evolution is based on the Scientific method, but is not proven. Creationism isnt even near being proven. So, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?"
2036,"I'm not sure it would even come up. The requirements to get a license in Mass are rigorous enough that no one would go to Mass just to fascilitate getting married.

2038,"No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution."

2040,"Ironic, since your ""Out of China"" post was basically the same as this post.You even claim you had no debate point, you were just posting ""information"". It wasn't until you claimed that evolution relied on those two mutual theories that we proceeded to debate. Maybe this young 13 year old christian is just following in your golden footsteps...you might give them a little leeway if you, yourself, do this as well. Or are you above the rules of the average forum participant? Hmmm.-Mach"
2041,Yeah and he wasn't prosecuted for the legal act you're referring to. If so then anybody could be prosecuted for possessing a firearm prior to the ban even if they voluntarily turned in their guns already. The problem is that he didn't turn in his gun. So that analogy with changing the speed limit is a false analogy. Let's not confuse the issue.
2042,"1) the theories and laws constantly change, so it's not like there's one standard that's benn kept to.

2049,"Depending on perspective, everything or nothing. Many on the liberal front often tell us that the police are there for the purpose of protecting us, that they'll keep us safe, that we don't need a gun if we just call 911 and let the police handle it, etc.Well a lot of good that advice is gonna do these South Carolina people, now that the police have been ordered not to pursue criminals who run from the scene of a crime. If they start hopping fences then the police can't pursue in their squad cars, and they can't get out to chase after them either.So...even before, the courts have stated explicitly that the job of the police is not to protect anyone, and now we have mayors ordering the police to not apprehend fleeing criminals. This means that those townspeople are gonna need to rely on themselves. And if the gun control laws are liberal and excessively strict, they're SOL. Innocent people are gonna get getting killed because of this new policy."
2050,"And there you have hit the nail on the head; there are both good and P-poor parents out there. Each case should be taken on its own merits; it's dam tough to make one rule fit all. Impossible, actually."
2051,"While that may be true of life in general, all it really logically entails is that SOME – not all – organisms throughout all of life’s history were able to reproduce. And at a smaller scale, it does not apply to any individual organism: it doesn’t tell us that in order for organism X to be considered living that it must reproduce (take for example, mules). Must All Living Organisms Die?An implicit assumption in the last several arguments is that all living things must die. After all, if a living organism didn’t die, then it wouldn’t need to reproduce in order to persist, even for 4 billion years. We need to ask, “Does this assumption of universal death hold?” Yes, well, at least for all instances of life that we currently know of. Thus, it is a conclusion based on induction, not on necessity. Consider a species capable of repairing itself indefinitely. Sound far fetched? Well, we humans ourselves are desiring to do just that. And to an extremely limited degree, we have succeeded. Of course, we still have an enormous distance left before fully succeeding, but if we were to eventually do so, then could it really be said that reproduction is a requirement to consider humans as being alive? No. We’d be like “immortal mules”: we’d be alive, yet incapable of reproducing … but unlike mules, we wouldn’t need to be continually replaced by reproduction. After all, we could stop reproducing (women might really like that idea!) and instead focus on repairing those that currently exist.Perhaps, though, we “immortal mules”, by simply repairing ourselves and maintaining the status quo, would still somehow die: after all, nature shows us that those organisms that don’t adapt to the ever changing conditions on Earth just don’t last. Perhaps the changes in our environment would be too dramatic to be handled by simply replacing what is damaged with a new part. This line of reasoning fails since our intent is not simply to repair ourselves, but to improve ourselves as well. Humans intend to direct their own bodily evolution, either via installed hardware or through genetic manipulations, adapting our bodies to changes in the environment. And if we ever reach this ultimate goal (is it a good goal?!), then we could save energy by modifying our bodies to eliminate the no-longer-required processes involved in reproduction . ConclusionBased on the above lines of reason, I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life: that something could be considered to be alive without it necessarily needing to be able to reproduce."

2058,"I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder."
2059,"I understand that the position is commonly called  Pro-life.  However, pro-life should not just concern abortion. Pro-life should be about safe sex, peace, stem cell research, exercise, healthy eating and pollution control. As of yet, I've never seen a Pro-life rally against obesity -- which kills more than any abortion clinic. It truly is  Anti-Abortion  and some can argue that it is  Anti-Choice.  The reason it's not call anti-anything is because the prefix  anti  implies a negative, and all of our connotations make it a bad thing. No one wants to be anti-choice.  And seriously, other than people who directly profit from it, who is  pro-death?   As for the original post, it seems that story is more about some African women not knowing how to deliver babies, or prevent them."

If only you took the time to actually educate yourself rather than trying to pass off mythology as reality."
2075,"Not if a judge rules in conflict with the instrument from which he derives his power to begin with. For example, expanding voting rights to 5 year olds would certainly expand freedom, but if a judge were to say that the constitution required expanding the vote to 5 year olds, then that would he wrong.  I like freedom very much. I also happen to like law and order very much. I simply cannot bring myself to either think or live according to a view that is fundamentally inconsistent and irrational, and which would lead to a republic where a written constitution does not posses any meaning at all."
2076,"I think your questions could be considered in a theological context. We're taught that we are a ""special creation"", made in God's image. Then as a added bonus he gave us dominion over other animals, which is a great source of boastfulness for some people (Consider the pride of a man, his chest swelling as he contemplates his intellectual superiority over a billy goat, for instance). This combination allows for the thinking that humans aren't natural in this world and are somehow above it all IMO, which leads to your observation of ""arrogance""."

2081,"As should be plainly obvious, this is an almost total ban on all semi-automatic weapons in the City of Columbus, not just those that have been traditionally considered 'assault weapons' (automatic firearms).Note definition (L)(2). Almost every semi-automatic pistol is included in that definition.Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad (or constitutional), or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad (or constitutional), it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban."
2082,"I think i disagree with the majority of people that have already posted here. evolution and creationism are mutually exclusive, and the both cannot be true at the same time, since there can be only one true way that life originated (even though i know that ""evolution"" is not the correct term to describe the origin of life, and die-hard evolutionist might chew me out for using it wrongly. I prefer to use the term ""spontaneous origin"" rather than ""evolution""). since creationism and the collection of spontaneous origin theories are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist, then upon proving either you automatically disprove the other. and if a 3rd unforseen theory is proven as the real way life originated on earth, then it would automatically disprove the both creationism and the current spontaneous origin theoriesthe 2 concepts are pretty much diametrically opposed right now, both competing for evidence to support its case, and a strengthening of one theory automatically implies a weakening of the other"
2083,"You can consider it all you want philosophically, you just can't figure it into science, not at present. It's not as though Creationists have any idea how to test Intelligent Design, because  Goddidit!  isn't a scientific theory. And no matter how much ID Creationists like to pretend they aren't all about god and biblical creation, they are transparent in their disingenuity."
2084,"**The war against war metaphorsThe age-old practice may harm both science and scientists[Published 16th February 2007 03:05 PM GMT]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Last month, when the University of Nottingham in the UK opened its new Centre for Healthcare Associated Infections, a facility dedicated to studying and controlling ""superbugs,"" The Guardian newspaper interviewed its director, Richard James, about why such a research center was necessary. He said: ""This is a sophisticated army with astonishing weapons. And each time we develop something new, [bacteria] develop a defense for it."" The use of such war metaphors in science and medicine is not new. As early as 1934, the British Medical Journal wrote about the ""War Against Cancer,"" a phrase we still often hear. But today, militaristic language pops up in almost every scientific domain: conservation biology (""invasive species,"" ""biosecurity""); global warming (""global war on global warming""); and biomedicine (""killer cells,"" ""hitting multiple targets""). The attraction to such language is understandable, as it draws attention, and perhaps even funding (who can forget US President Richard Nixon's declaration to ""conquer"" cancer in his 1971 state of the union address, since which hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into cancer research?). Still, some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language. For instance, scientists who use military terms may risk losing credibility, warned Erik von Elm, an epidemiologist at the University of Berne in Switzerland and co-author of a recent Lancet correspondence on military metaphors. ""One of the features of science should be to be objective,"" but war metaphors are precisely the opposite, he noted. ""These terms have an intention, they are sort of modern propaganda."" Indeed, when Nottingham's James referred publicly to the coming ""post-antibiotic apocalypse,"" the UK's Chief Nursing Officer accused him of sensationalism and scaremongering. Scientists who frame problems in a militaristic manner also likely have a drastically limited perception of the problem and how to tackle it, noted Berkeley cognitive linguist George Lakoff. ""This is not language, this is the way people think."" In microbiology, for instance, scientists often frame viruses and bacteria as the enemy, and may focus on destroying them and be blind to alternatives, said Brigitte Nerlich, professor of science, language and society at the University of Nottingham. With bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), however, ""You have to look at multiple factors, and not just in terms of attack and defend,"" she said. Indeed, some argue that our militaristic use of antimicrobial agents has, by introducing new selection pressures, only made pathogens stronger, while a consideration of other factors -- like host behavior and the social and physical environment -- could offer better solutions. Brendon Larson, assistant professor of environment and resources studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada, argued the same of ""invasion biology,"" where scientists may automatically assume an invading species must be removed. But in some cases, a sustainable relationship makes more sense -- for example, removal of the ""invading"" Himalayan blackberry from parts of California hurt the native tricolored blackbird, which used the plants as nesting habitats. ""We're entrenched in a particular way of seeing this situation, that [invasive species are] enemies, they're bad and we have to get rid of them,"" Larson told The Scientist. Indeed, according to Larson, the modern use of military terminology may have contributed to US President George W. Bush's decision to merge part of the government agency responsible for invasive species into the Department of Homeland Security. Still, scientists are not likely to move beyond the adversarial metaphor anytime soon, said Columbia University's Barron Lerner, author of The Breast Cancer Wars: Hope, Fear and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America. ""They're here to stay,"" Lerner said, admitting that when he was writing about the prevalence of such metaphors, he unknowingly began using them himself. Remembering, as writer Susan Sontag advised, that war metaphors in medicine can be misleading, and remaining aware of metaphors' effect on science, is the best scientists can do, Lerner noted.

2087,"Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there."
2088,"That's nonsense. When Darwin was at the University of Edinburgh studying medicine, he spent more time studying zoology and geology. His teachers were some of the most respected scientists of the day. Later, when he was at Christ's College, Cambridge studying divinity in preparation entry into the seminary, he actually spent more time studying botany and natural science, under John Henslow (a mineralologist and botanist). Darwin later studied with Adam Sedgwick (a geologist). Both men were leading scientists in their field of the day (both taught at Cambridge). Henslow became a lifelong friend of Darwin and it was his recommendation that gained Darwin the position aboard the Beagle. By the way, both men were ordained in the Chruch of England."
2089,"Before writing your biography, Mariast,.... did you happen to note the title and subject of the thread?   What would it take to change your mind about abortion?

Her conception was the very first time that a part of me (and a part of her mother) became a part of Her."
2090,"Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest."
2091,"You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him. Fear made him do this. The fear was created in him by the buglers. You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes, but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers."

DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage  (AP) Â– 4 hours ago  WASHINGTON Â— Washington D.C.'s City Council has voted to legalize gay marriage in the nation's capital.  Mayor Adrian Fenty has promised to sign the bill, which was co-sponsored by 10 of the council's 13 members. The final vote Tuesday was 11-2.  The bill now goes to Congress, which has final say over the district's laws. Opponents say they'll try to get Congress or voters to overturn it.  Passage of the bill is a victory for gay marriage supporters, who have been dealt a recent string of defeats in Maine, New York and New Jersey.  Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. New Hampshire will begin issuing licenses in January.  If Congress doesn't reject the bill, D.C. should start issuing marriage licenses around St. Patrick's Day.The Associated Press: DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage"
2093,"I think it's pretty clear that this is in violation of the Supreme Court's current abortion jurisprudence, at least to the extent that one could actually figure that out.

2096,"Actually just as many atheist help the needy. Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable. Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too! George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626 emoticonXByeBTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need emoticonXIdea"
2097,"If you have evidence for something, what purpose is faith with respect to that thing?Faith is belief with no evidence.Or from the dictionary:  Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.If you verify something scientifically then is it even possible to believe it by faith?"

The world is clearly getting hotter, all the data supports this. It's not like we're talking rocket science here.

I've made your arguments look presumptuous, pretentious and silly, but you have never yet succeeded in doing that to any of mine."
2108,Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.

2112,"Because the eyes reveal where someone (or something) is looking. Since we have a narrow range of perception this information tells the looker important information about what we are interested in at that time. Note that many animals don't look into each others eyes (most herbivours; since they have near-360 degree vision, eyes convey almost no information), and many animals take different information from them than we do (cats for example take looking at them as hostile behaviour, and narrowing the eyes and looking away as friendly)."
2113,"You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death."
2114,"But of course. Why wouldn't creationists call for carbon 14 dating on inappropriate samples?

2118,"Then I'd like to see your definition of the scientific method. As I recall, the scientific method is purely secular.  What evidence of God? Please, show me such evidence. There is no evidence of God. God is of the supernatural, you cannot prove the supernatural with evidence from the natural! God cannot be proven, nor can it be disproven. There is no evidence of God, and there is no evidence that there is no unorthodox God."
2119,"Because in the case of glacial/interglacial variation, CO2 functions as a feedback from orbital forcing. Again, this is all very simple, basic stuff outlined in chapter 6 of the AR4."
2120,"Well, that would seem pretty obvious under that definition that it did not arise because of a single court case."
2121,"Just to follow suit - note the bolded: What do you mean everyone knows who made everything. If that were true then there would be no religious differences throughout the world, no theological discussion, no theory of evolution, no need for this thread.As for your assertion that evolution is random/accidental, you are, yet again, making a false statement (either through ignorance or deliberate falsehood). Mutation is random, natural selection done by waiting to see which mutation makes survival (and propagation) more likely. There will also be random events such as natural disasters, ice-ages, droughts etc which do introduce a bit of random luck into the equation, but that's about it.If this thoughtful being created a harmonious existence, doesn't the extinction of umpteen species screw things up somewhat, or can your inexplicable harmony just carry on regardless.Smiley"

2129,"Please explain how ID is suppressed. It is taught as a hypothesis currently, and even if it were banned from being mentioned in schools, scientists can still do all the research they want on it. And you should know censorchip usually makes the idea more popular, just as banning the f word makes more people use it. Scientists would do research on ID, there is no suppression.You have shown how there may be benefit if there is a God and we assume ID is true. No specific examples, and no proof it's true. This is simply a guess, a ""theory"" as used in normal terms. In the science terms that would be a hypothesis. It is currently taught as a hypothesis.The point comes down to the fact that the debate isn't about whether it should be taught as a hypothesis, but whether it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. You have admitted that not only does evolution have a lot of evidence, it has also led to many contributioins in science.You are the affirmative so it is up to you to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. So far you have shown that it's an interesting idea, that may in the future lead to some good things. But you have failed to prove that it is in any way even close to the theory of evolution."

But then, what can we expect from somebody citing a website trying to sell you liquid vitamin supplement...Nevertheless, we look into the Pottenger's cats claim.Here is a page called, ""Lesson of the Pottenger's Cats Experiment: cats are not humans."" Although it's a page aimed at explaining why this ""experiment"" is not applicable to humans, it exposes the other, erm, flaws in this experiment. The one striking me based on the wikipedia list of diets for the groups should be obvious to everyone: many of these cats were being deprived of protein. This page confirms and elaborates. In fact, its first point is that today's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today's cooked food. The difference is that good owners don't feed their pets deficient diets.The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism. In order for supersport to be supported, the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids. Obviously, they did not. The only thing we see here is the effect of poor (i.e. positively malnutritive) diet.We can conclude that supersport's Morton's demon is pretty much in full control. There's no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports Lamarckism, or even counters evolutionary theory, even if he doesn't know the basics of experimentation and nutrition."
2131,"WOW it comes down to this; heterosexuals are given a privledge just because of who they are and who they love. Gay people are denied equal treatment to heterosexuals because of who they are and who they love. The way I understand this is that segregation deined blacks equal treatment to whites because of who they where. You would not deny that the latter is a civil rights issue but you can not bring yourself to see the former is also. Why is that? So what you are saying is that it is ok to discriminate based upon sexual orientation but not race or religion? Why?  When heterosexuality and homosexuality are treated equally and both are considered normal and acceptable then I will move on. There is nothing wrong with being gay, it is not a sin, and it is not immoral. Until being gay is considered equal to being a hetero then you will just have to continue being sick of hearing about it. I am sick of hearing evil funamenalists insult my family because of who we are. I am sick of being denied marriage because of someone elses privledge, and religious beliefs.

2137,"The idea that the earth was flat was an  accepted  principle as well. There is no verse that I know of that ever claims man has  free will . In fact, the Bible actually says that before you can even choose to follow God he must first choose you."

2140,Well you've made a good point; just because something is banned or made illegal doesn't mean that it'll have an affect on reducing the numbers.
2141,"Perhaps an analogy. Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink (personally against it, for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drink and smoke if they so choose. So, you are personally against drinking and smoking but you are ""pro-choice"" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves).Pro-life would be: You don't drink and smoke (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure that no one else is able to either."
2142,"Not in this instance, no. It isn’t trying to parallel pregnancy per se(though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months), but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent. If the pro-life mantra is to be believed, it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do. So, the argument is applicable for 9 days, 9 months, 9 years or forever."
2143,But if you had read carefully the information that I provided you would realize:  The people that already own weapons don't seem to be doing much to combat crime and are probably doing more to cause the problem than to solve it. So throwing more guns at the problem doesn't seem to make much sense.

Back about 5 years ago, they had a family member come out and say that they testified wrongly against them. Second, the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an XXXXX and a big fraidy cat. Because of his loonicy, too many people lost jobs wrongfully (and lives) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened.  Besides, the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place. They were more of a threat to themselves."

I do take notice of how it could have started a conversation about how we could and should be talking about ways to lessen B on B crime, but instead we got some misdirection.

However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of their criminal predators. What do you say you work for changing these conditions instead."

After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check. I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years."
2161,"No but his complete dependence on a media machine certainly takes away from the validity of his message. The models for climate change that Gore recites are strictly weather and do not look at global climate patterns and do not look at climate changes within history.

2162,"Your statment is like saying we evented 2+2= 4. We did not envent it, it aways existed. Same with logic, its a concept that exists apart from the meterial universe. But in the atheists worldview, only the meterial universe exists."
2163,"I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:  There is no evidence ANYWHERE that the second ammendment is a collective right. We ghave been over this multiple times, and the evidence simply does not exist, and an organization like the ACLU should be well aware of this."
2164,"again, this is only good as a reasonable assumption, and nothing more. in many cases, the least likely answer is true. you cannot create evidence out of assumptions. you test the assumptions against reality, then the assumptions can be confirmed. i agree that reasonable assumptions are useful, but basing an assumption upon another assumption causes the likeliness to decrease.  for example, under the assumption that (a) jesus is devine, and that (b) God exists, it is likely that (c) jesus performed miracles. c can only be considered a reasonable assumption of a and b were already true. since a and b are assumptions themselves, then it makes c much more unlikely.  as opposed to the case of the footprints. if (a) people wear shoes and (b) there is a footprint in the lawn, it is likely that (c) a person stood on the lawn. in this case, a and b are verifiable, and by they being true, we can consider c a reasonable assumption"
2165,"Good has nothing do with logic. Explain what good and logic have in common????The Christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from God. God is transcendent; that is, He is beyond the material universe being its creator. God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature. Therefore, the laws of logic are absolute. The are absolute because there is an absolute God. The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes, and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue."

It doesn't show that we have high crime rates whichever stats you accept."
2167,So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?Nope he does not believe in natural selection either. He believes that genes (and epigenetics) are the product of direct intelligent modification by the species which is evolving. He believes in what one has to call intelligent vitalism. Basiclly Lamarckism with some bells and whistles.  In fact he is simply an anti-evolutionist and probably a creationist at heart. Do not expect cogent scientific argument from his direction.

2174,"Ah, yes, a return to the redefinition of '(un)natural'. Fair enough - it's using the Bible to support a viewpoint, but that's kinda what creationism is I guess.From the 'scientific' creationist view, the challenge would be to then prove that humans have never undergone 'micro'evolution. Especially given the various mutations and differences in humans today - from minor differences like height and hair colour to more major differences like minor variations in bone structure (often racial differences) to the most extreme differences like varying number of appendages (see the 'two-toed' tribes).But you're right - I guess that the traditional response would be 'the bible says this, so reality must be wrong...'"
2175,"Indeed the court's reasoning may have been as racist as your own. Indeed, the article describes how the court's reasoning was even a surprise to the police officers' attorney because it was so out of line with what is expected of conduct during arrests.She was not violent and she had an obvious health condition.Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer. Because you're a racist."

If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves.

Over 80% of the crimes are committed by Mexican gang members, many of which are ex-soldiers and drug enforcement for the mafias.  Nope, not safe at all when foreign invaders attack Texans on our side of the river and do pseudo cop break and enters of homes or robbery of businesses.  That is a good example of the importance of being armed. One county sheriff along the river encouraged citizens to get armed just for that purpose, freely admitting that his officers will not be there when they are needed the most. We Texans have kidnapping and ransome too but reserve our right to protect ourselves unlike EuroAsia who has copitulated entirely.  You were saying?"

I could give you examples, but I'm not sure you would pay attention.Just to show I'm not bluffing: if you typed a paper while sleepy, went to bed, and woke up only to find errors in your paper, the best conclusion would be to assume that you made the mistakes, rather than that a hacker put them there. I expect that most times, there was no hacker. The explanation with fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct.However, having all the information is important. If you later find out that a computer genius was submitting a paper to a contest that you were submitting yours to and that most of the other papers involved had many errors, the likelyhood of a hacker goes up.Yes, I know that was a weird example. I only used it because there is someone who actually believes (according to rinkworks.com) that a hacker messes with her writing."

Perhaps you should head back to school and learn some simple biological classification/taxonomic ranking."
2203,"Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them."

And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for  walking in a mile in another's shoes .

2223,"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see."

I can see that interior to logical reasoning, ""necessity"" must exist in every reality - otherwise what we understand as ""logic"" would not be that but something else.To simplify: All my friends are IrishSheila is my friendSo Sheila is Irish. (The same sort of logical necessity applies (I think) to propositions involvingmathematics: 6+2 = 8 cannot be refuted because 6+2 is just another wayof writing 8.)As Sheila exists in the real world, the information about her contained in thesyllogism also happens to be factually true.But the necessary truths of logic including the proposition that God exists,are deduced from applying the rules of logic and are not necessarily factualtruths and seem to have the same status as Sheila would if she existed only as an idea."

2244,"Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of ""proofs"" reveal themselves. What's next, Nostradamus?"
2245,"The reality is this is no different the following link: ie...the animals who were fed one diet passed on traits differently than those who were fed another diet. Traits, according to evolutionists arise RANOCMLY. Get that, geniuses? RANDOMLY. This is not random. Structural damage in this case did not happen randomly....nor did the dengenerative effects to the fur, nervous systems, bones, allergies, and mental processes. Instead this was all dictated by the environment. Thus, despite the emergence of new traits in the milk/cooked food-fed diet of the one population, it had nothing to do with darwinian random mutation or natural selection. This is a hole. A huge hole....it's environmental evolution...that is, animals simply changing with a changing environment. Lamarckism predicts that the environment changes first, followed up by new traits. Neo-darwinists say that new traits arise before and/or unoriented to the environment, only to be then be selected.I win.And this is no different than the following:http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/7/5/14/1/ Normally, the fur of agouti mice is yellow, brown, or a calico-like mixture of the two, depending on the number of attached methyl groups. But when Duke University researchers Jirtle and Waterland fed folic acid and other methyl-rich supplements to pregnant mothers, despite the fact that all offspring inherited exactly the same agouti gene (i.e., with no nucleotide differences), mice who received supplements had offspring with mostly brown fur, whereas mice without supplements gave birth to mostly yellow pups with a higher susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and cancer.LAMARCKJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829)  The environmental ability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Eighteenth-century French naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck proposed that environmental cues could cause phenotypic changes transmittable to offspring. Checkmate, losers.Oh, and by the way, electro-loser.....it doesn't matter if this diet experiment can be extrapolated to humans or not. (Of course I realize you are just spouting your mouth off just to hear your head rattle)...the reality is, though, these cats evolved new traits by way of non-darwinian mechanisms. So did the mice in both experiments and so did the pigs. Are you truly trying to tell me that cats and mice and pigs evolve by way of the inheritance of acquired characteristics but humans don't?"
2246,"Indeed the court's reasoning may have been as racist as your own.  Indeed, the article describes how the court's reasoning was even a surprise to the police officers' attorney because it was so out of line with what is expected of conduct during arrests.  She was not violent and she had an obvious health condition.  Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.  I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer. Because you're a racist."

2250,"Not at all true. They secrete mucous, they do not melt.  As for the absence of some verses form various versions/editions of the bible - I have had that problem too, and not just with quotes form  infidels.  For example, many versions have 're-interpreted' or re-translated' various verses to reflect certain political views and ideologies (which I find disgusting). For example, I have heard of a version that now singles out  abortionists  as evil-doers, and I have had a hard time tracking down online bibles that contain the actual KJV of Luke 14:26 - many have removed the word  hate  and replaced with a more conservatively correct  love less , which is not even what the original Greek was...  So, not being able to find certain verses does not mean that they are made-up or otherwise inaccurate, it may be that various versions have altered/omitted some of them..."

2253,"And no, it is not at all clear that this is not about abortion, Phyl, because you keep bringing the topic up. Because you declare something, that doesn’t make it so.Lastly, you are asking the opinions of members of a forum here. If you want our opinions, great. If our opinions differ from some court ruling, it does not mean the opinions are wrong, it means they differ. Given your criterion, the only way to express opinions here would be if we were doing it from the bench."

2255, Laws restricting ownership of any weapon is unconstitional.   Are you saying that private citizens should be able to own nuclear and biological weapons according to the second amendment?
2256,"As President Calderón and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war, President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month. He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America. (In actuality, according to ATF special agent William Newell, about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States. And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico's government.) ""We're going to be very focused on this. It's going to be a top priority."" ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama ""felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a[s] it affects their safety.”You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90% figure, Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it. Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they don't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico. Yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either can't or won't get control of their criminals."

Biological evolution, ie the theory of evolution, is unrelated to this everyday use of the term. ""Astronomical evolution"", just like ""Trumpet evolution"" has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. When you grasp this simple concept, you will have made your first step toward becoming knowledgable about the theory. At the moment, you are stuck on the start line boasting about the end of the race: you are a YEC supporter in other words."
2261,"This all comes down to fear of retribution from gay people. They know that they have been the leading cause of our oppression, they know that the tide and culture is turning in our favor.

2266,"Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks."

2273,"Results. After adjustment, individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 (P<.05) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession. Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P<.05).  Conclusions. On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur  each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.   http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcon...dennis_culhane  Not owning a gun makes me safer and two cherry picked 911 calls does not disprove that."

But it is only allowed under restricted prescription (it's a Schedule II controlled substance, the same as morphine or cocaine) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC."
2275,"I may just be being picky, but it bothers me when a reputable journal like NS can print  You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.  As I said, I may just be being nit-picky. Language apart, this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes."
2276,"Open your eyes  It already has happened  The U.S. gun industry sold at least twenty-five 50 caliber sniper rifles to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, a study released by the Violence Policy Center (VPC) today reports. The study, Voting From the Rooftops, details the tremendous power of the Barrett M82A1 50 caliber sniper rifles&#65533; which U.S. Marines used in the Gulf War to knock out Iraqi armored vehicles from 1,750 yards away&#65533;and the gun's potential use to commit terror acts that could cause enormous casualties. The Barrett sniper rifle has spawned a bourgeoning market for these types of weapons that are becoming cheaper, lighter and more widely available. There are known to be at least fifteen 50 caliber sniper rifle manufacturers&#65533;nearly double the number of companies that were manufacturing and marketing 50 calibers to civilians in1999.   We can be shocked, but not surprised that the gun industry would sell these dangerous military weapons to Al Qaeda,  said the study's author, Tom Diaz, VPC's senior policy analyst.  These 50 caliber sniper rifles are ideal tools for terror and assassination."

2280,"I'm not even going to comment on the '6000 years old' statement.As to predicting the orbits of planets, it's simple. Due to the laws of gravity, planets go in regular circular or elliptical paths.

2281,"Of course not, nor did I intend to imply that they were. I merely suggest that an increase, through education, in awareness of the diversity of religious belief has led some to a fuzzy-minded many-paths mentality, some to the conclusion that if 99.99% are wrong, there's a strong probability they're all wrong. There are lots of other positions."
2282,"Yes, the mythology has been around for a long time. Most cultures had their own. You have adopted the mythology of ancient Hebrews. You probably even somehow reconcile both stories of creation in your mind. But the technology and the techniques to use that technology didn't develop until about 400 years ago. Every since then we have used the idea that we can learn about our world by careful observation and experimentation. About 150 years ago, Darwin and Wallace recognized a mechanism for why living things change. About the same time, Mendel recognized how those changes were passed on to off spring. That the Biblical mythology of creation was false was actually demonstrated by men who believed in creation. They tried to reconcile their Bible with what was obviously true from the observations they made. But creationism has only been around since the early 20th century. It grew out of the anti-science movement of fundamentalism. It actually became popular in the 1960's."
2283,"Are you referring to the Epicurians? Aristotle? I can't think of any reference to these people as atheists. Socrates was accused of being an atheist, and the accusation made it clear this was because he didn't believe in the gods. Some schools of Hinduism have been atheistic from BC, and Buddhism (founded before 400 BC) is essentially atheistic, in that there are 'gods' but they are considered limited and not given much importance.More generally, I think modern atheists and fundamentalists are both largely the result of 1) the breakdown in everyone conforming to one religion, probably starting at the Reformation2) the scientific outlook making people mistake religious meaning for scientific meaning, causing them to either think the Bible must be scientifically true because it's religiously meaningful, or that it must be religiously meaningless because it's scientifically false. Richard Dawkins and the average creationist make the same fundamental mistake - the greeks would say they mistook 'muthos' (myth, allegory) for 'logos' (reason, science)"

2296,"Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant."
2297,"And, of course, you totally miss the point.  The point is that a 1-day-old infant can be cared for by ANYBODY! It is no longer dependent upon the body and resources of only one person.

The 2nd amend does not say people need guns for self defense!The 2nd amend does not say people need guns to hunt with!The 2nd amend does not say people need guns to target shoot with!Gun hater pilot will then later start saying since we have a standing army there is no reason for militias.Gun hater pilot will then say hey we have police to protect us, so why do people need guns to defend themselves. Gun hater pilot will then say we have grocery store so why do people need to hunt?Gun hater pilot will then say why do you need to target shoot if you no longer need guns to hunt or defend yourself?Gun hater pilot will continue adding why do you need guns reasons until the reason gun hater pilot said are gone.It is always interesting how gun haters like gun hater pilot apply the common sense lie to banning the right to bear arms. What gun hater pilot will never apply the common sense thing is to demand that dangerous criminals be removed from the streets of America to make it safe.The only paranoid people are the gun haters that want to ban the right to bear arms of law abiding citizens. Notice gun hater pilot did state if you cannot trust one person you must suspect all people! That is what being paranoid is!"
2300,"IMO, that's beside the point. The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people. Sure, people may still oppose gay marriage even if it's done legislatively as opposed to judicially, but at least then they'd have the chance and opportunity to do so. With only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important. So I think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat. Of course you feel they shouldn't have a say, so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat."
2301,right...genes evolved to the point to where they can't even be defined anymore....Evolution has evolved.... Natural selection naturally selected itself out. yup.
2302,"I was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion. Liberals don't give a damn about individual freedom; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life. They want gov't control of healthcare because they think we're too dumb to fend for ourselves. They want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they don't trust parents to be parents. The list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless. And I have no problem with gays, just their attempts to redefine marriage."
2303,"You are not only rude but incorrect in calling sinjin an idiot. His opinion is just as valid as yours. He is quite far from idiocy.I percieve his point to be that you do not have a right to endanger the lives of others by engaging in a firefight with some perps who may not have fired if you hadn't shown up playing Sheriff. While we have not yet perfected a method of reliably predicting exactly what some perp will do if left in control with a gun in his hand in a crowded mall, we can assume that more harm will come if he is not taken down and disarmed. The fact that a citizen may legally have a gun in his pocket capable of knocking down a large animal rather than a pea-shooter that will only make it mad is comforting to me. I like big guns, too.I can agree somewhat with the idea of hesitating to interfere when an altercation seems imminent, but I cannot agree that armed citizens should never ""endanger the lives of others"" by pulling his piece and firing at the perp.By the way, when you quote someone you should use their exact words, not your version of what they said...and you should apologize to sinjin for calling him an idiot."

Again, my apologies, but prs has no idea of the difference between Lamarckian and Darwinian theory, and how that theoretical difference would be reflected in different social theories. As far as I can tell prs has nothing but preconceived misconceptions about this. I felt compelled to speak up. Hope you're not put out about my intrusion."
2308,"False. This is not a valid definition of atheism. Atheism is the lack of theism (the belief in gods). Certainly, if I said ""there isn't a tiger in my bathroom"", I wouldn't need to have a camera in there to see. It's called being reasonable."

2311,"But Mexicans and Native Americans are the same species, so it's not just like that. This butterfly is a species different than either parent.One reason that that particular creationist objection has no merit is because the butterflies are significantly biologically different (i.e. different species). The fact that we call each species a type of butterfly has only to do with our taxonomic system.If we were to somehow have fossils representing the complete record of the water-to-land transition, one would be forced to pick a point at which a fish became a land animal. Just because one finds this a difficult task to accomplish doesn't mean that there was no transition. Likewise, this applies to any line of ancestry.As an example, look at creationists' response to Archaeopteryx. Many insisted that it is a bird. Others insisted that it is a reptile. A few have originally called it a bird, then decided that it must be a reptile. The fact that people have trouble fitting an organism into our previously-learned concepts of classifications is a sign that species have changed significantly."
2312,Thanks for the complement on intelligence.
2313,It's a valid scientific theory which has been successful.
2314,This case is about a criminal trying to say sawed off shotguns are military weapons. The court said no. The military does use shot guns in other forms.  This court case did not say any thing else but that. It did say part of the 1934 NFA act was unconstitutional.

2318,"I like that term ""pro-science."":p"
2319,"No, it's not.  The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since.  First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's  hopeful monsters  that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the  only micromutations  view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's.  Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a  semi-macro  mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record).  Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times."
2320,"You're right, as well as having the institution of marriage on the line. But you are the one who seems to think this is a game, based on your posts. (with your comments like  you've won ;  he's lost , and other silly things, as if this is a basketball game or something.) It seems you'd do well to take your own advice.  If you want people to constantly have to  justify  something to you, then you should make your own compelling arguments first; throw something out there yourself rather than expect everyone else to do it for you. No one owes you anything here. As for me, I'm not interested in your little games."
2321,"Speaking of antibody diversification:  Evolution In Action: Our Antibodies Take 'Evolutionary Leaps' To Fight Microbes  Wonder what the reaction would be if the title was:  Teleological Evolution in Action: Our Antibodies Take 'Evolutionary Leaps' to fight Microbes  Why Teleological evolution? Well, the immune system purposefully manipulates information by using the optimality of the genetic code, random variation and selection as a means to an end? antibody diversification. (See how)  Teleological evolution is not limited to the immune system.  Somatic evolution of malignancy alse seem to have a teleological streak  Adaptive landscapes and emergent phenotypes: why do cancers have high glycolysis?  Somatic evolution of malignancy:  The purposeful manipulating of information by using the optimality of the genetic code, random variation and selection as a means to an end? adaptation to hypoxic and acidic fitness landscapes.  Viewing cells as computers that make other computers and information as an irreducible property of nature makes this view tenable."
2322,"Walking-fish:  A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating. They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable. Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth, such as Robt Gentry's Polonium halos, rate of decay in the earth's magnetic field, rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth. This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates. Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries. So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands, hire a young earth creationist."
2323,"just how i said it... opinion...  like, what you think of it"
2324,"I know what you mean. I also wonder how they think their children or grandchildren will be paying for their medical bills.  Note, by way of comparison, this Pittsburgh local t.v. clip of the September 20th March for Jobs (part of Healthcare Justice Week, this week).

2328,"What has this got to do with the non-material world, of which God and you and I are a part of?I know that the Apostles witnessed God's miracles. I too am witness to God's miracles. The evidence is adequate for me and for much of the world's population... even many scientists (including evolutionists). You are in a loud minority, railing against the irrational hoards about you."
2329,"There are lot's of things that conduct electricity to some degree or another.  Polysilanes, for just one example, has a backbone of -Si-Si-Si-, and conducts because the sigma orbitals of Si are diffuse enough to overlap.  It's this de-localization of electrons that allows for conductivity.  If a carbon polymer has a lot of double/triple bonds or benzene rings then it should conduct.  Just like graphite, which is much more conductive along the a and b axes (the axes where the graphene planes lie) because of all the electronic delocalization.  But it's a poor conductor along the c-axis, because there are only weak pi-pi interactions and little orbital overlap.  Sulfur, I suppose would be a poor candidate for the basis of life.  The only times it forms more than two bonds is if it is bonded to a very electronegative atom like oxygen or fluorine. Also, it does not catenate very easily, and if it did, it would just be a chain of sulfur (no longer than 8 atoms long) with practically no functionality."
2330,This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists.
2331,"Ummm, no. How could I possibly be forcing my beliefs on you when my view is for each person to have a choice. Your view is to force society to do away with all abortions."
2332,"No I won't walk into that situation. What you feel to be right is OK with me. It is what you feel to be right and try to make it public policy is what I disagree with.  You should fear yourself. YOU are a greater danger to yourself than a felon with a firearm. You have an extremely skewed sense of risk assement. I don't expect to change your mind, after all I don't expect to convince someone with an irrational fear of flying that it is safe.  Want to kill yourself? Sucide? That is very irrational isn't it?"
2333,Certainly it does.
2334,I see. Then what you are claiming is that creationists are the ones who should define the vocabulary to be used by evolutionary biologists. Would it then be ok for atheists to define the vocabulary of Christianity?
2335,Just wondering if you are going to respond to the OP (as it was addressed to you to help you to understand something).  If you ask me I'd just ignore the negative comments that some posters make toward you. Just focus onexplanations of misunderstandings and constructive criticism.

2340,Don't go tellin' that to people like Rev. Alan Keyes. He was bent on the idea that straight marriage would be banned if gay marraige was allowed.
2341,"And you're quite naive if you think that emotional examples mean anything against the facts. The so-called  Partial Birth  Abortion is quite rare and usually only performed to save the mother's life, but now they're going to have to let the mother die because Dubya has banned this now thus the first step to going back to the  good old days  when women were nothing more than property. You're the sick one.  Also, with your resorting to such tactics shows that you are losing.  BTW, isn't putting  Your god  under your name somewhat sacrilegious by putting yourself above your god? I guess that I'll be seeing you in Hell."
2342,"They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species).

2343,"And a woman's life choices, health, and finances aren't up for hi-jacking. Every time a lifer talks about demanding the nine month rape, they talk about what the baby deserves or not deserves and how it shouldn't be punished.

2346,personally I don't accept the premise of the question.
2347,"This is not a part of the argument, though. Whether or not the woman can or cannot perform activities she wishes to do (which is not the case in pregnancy, btw, or at least varies greatly according to the individual) is irrelevant; it deals with the moral question of disconnecting someone who will die if they are not connected with you. The argument is equally applicable no matter the womanÂ’s mobility."
2348,I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.
2349,"Yes, this is what I'm saying.  The  soul  and the  spirit  are the whole point of the bible's existence.  if it can't be plain about what they are and what to do with them,  then either god is a terrible author,  or (and this is the one you'll like) we are terrible readers.  Either way, god isn't making the instructions very clear."
2350,Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP. Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together.
2351,What is a waste of time is the fact the most creationists don't understand science. They listen to such people as Hovind and Ham and Baugh and believe that they are being told the truth. The fact that they don't know what the theory of evolution is only indicates that they haven't bothered to educate themselves before expressing opinions.

2359,"Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less."

2366,"But at least Evolutionist can give physical proofs for their beliefs.

Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment?

How can the world benefit from a simple statement that there is an intelligent designer. This has absolutely no application to the natural world today."

How is this an argument which justifies abortions in America where Fistulas is virtually unknown as a result of child birth? Tell me how this quoted section below applies to any aspect of medical care in the USA.The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby’s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor."

I never said Portugal was perfect, now did I? But I've been there and it's certainly a lot less flagrantly sexual in it's culture than the U.S."

2395,"And by old fashion I assume you mean Greece a couple of thousand years ago. That's the only place and time I can think of off hand where the populace (by which I mean landed men in this case) could vote to change laws. In this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law is via the courts, and always has been.  However, I don't think that is, in fact, what Jyoshu was refering to."
2396,"Abortion on demand is more accurate then abortion on request?request makes it sound so flimsy as if women need to sit in a waiting room and pleasantly request for it by some authority figure. Abortion on demand is by far more accurate because such a service is vital; not a ?convienence.? Abortion is an crucial sacrament within the fabric of American society; 1 in 4 women will have them but everyone is afraid to admit how much we depend on it. Abortion has always been popular whether it was in the 1700s or 2000s, whether criminal or legal and whether you were against it or not. Americans demand for abortion, not request it. Were black American slaves requesting or demanding freedom?  People who think abortion is a convenience are out of touch with reality and are deeply in denial."
2397,"While that definition of sin is true, the Hebrew definition means missing the mark. You could stretch it to mean unfit in English.And you're technically wrong about the bible. Modernly it is one book, but bible means little books. For a time they were floating around in clusters. So academically they are self contained and unrelated. The apocryphal books are ""secret"" books. Religious scholars eventually decided they were just a bunch of stories, and most never made it in the bible. Look at Song of Solomon it made the cut, and people still have problems with it being put in, yet it conflicts with nothing."
2398,"Mr. Justice Harlan once wrote: ""[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.""Justice Potter Stewart, a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon: ""Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453, we recognized ""the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."" ""That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.JPSartre12,"

2400,"Actually if you were educated in history you would know that Hitler was an evolutionists. If you got that simple trivial thing wrong, why should I trust you in things that I do not know? Atheistic evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith acknowledged of Hitler: The Germal Fuhrer ... is an evolutinoist; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of eolution.  ~ Keith, A., 1947.  Evolution and Ethics , Putman, New York, p.230.Don't worry, some of my friends didn't know either. If evolution is true, than it should have some reasonable explanation as to why we have morals, but it doesn't."
2401,"Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us."

2406,"But private citizens run background checks on other citizens all the time. I rent property. I make sure my tenants aren't felons before I lease anything. I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon. It is just something I personally would choose to do if I didn't know the buyer I was selling to..."
2407,"Yes, with a crime rate larger than New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Las Vegas, they're a wonderful example to follow, aren't they?"
2408,"(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?"
2409,"Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?  Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce  remotely  from Virginia.  Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.  Justice?  Equality?  I realize that people who  don't recognize gay marriage  often don't have those things in mind when it comes to gays, but those would be the reasons..."
2410,Life at every level -- from humans down to bacteria -- exhibit intelligence and very often cooperation. Darwinists got it all wrong.

2412,If guns make you happy and you do not break and criminal codes. Then you need no reason nor do you have to justify yourself to anyone. The Constitution or firearms laws have nothing to do with  if you need one .
2413,"Last I checked, drug prohibition began much earlier than the 1980s. The '80s fall in violent crime is more likely a result of the legalization of abortion than it is a result of the ""success of the war on drugs."""
2414,Did someone give you a wedgie?  It is in black and white in numerous sources not counting the detailed accounts from your own countrymen.  Methinks you stand accused all alone?
2415,you mistake one hominid for another and cite the words of a known fraud on the piltdown man instead of the other hominid.  What is amusing is that you can't post on another thread. No creationists has yet argued for the flood mind you.
2416,There's no mention of gays in the constitution.
2417,"Actually, if there was ever a time when Christianity could be reconcilled with evolution, it is in the modern context.  Don't go suggesting that all Christians find evolution as contradictory to the Bible, it is only the case in certain instances."

2419,But many christians are.
2420,oh and by the way i agree with Benjamin. God IS GOOD all the time and in the end God will win meaning creation beats evolution every time.  * i wonder how much i would get paid to make up another idea for evolution and convince people its ture. like peas evolved from acorns or something.*

2422,"The bible can hardly be argued as the infallible word of God, and if you think it is, then you are engaging in Circular Logic and believing in an unparsimonious being, which leaves you with 1 strike left as to why anyone should believe you.  Here comes the last pitch:  1. The Bible was written over and over and over by HUMANS many years post hoc, and it is applicable ONLY according to HUMAN interpretation, and the BIBLE is innaccurate on many occasions.  WOo hoo, game is won, by me."

Even if dropped to 9 and 15, it's still 24 million less than Hillary and Company claim...making their 47 million lose weight down to 23."
2428,I'd love to take that argument. Only the truly retarded believe that evolution is atheistic. Marc9000 himself doesn't or he'd be calling millions of believers in various dieties and religions to be atheists.
2429,"Says a person from the only nation to have used a nuclear weapon in anger. YouÂ’re a young country, but youÂ’re fast surpassing our death toll. IÂ’d personally argue that in many cases the British Empire brought benefits to the nations involved. Some countries werenÂ’t even conquered..."
2430,"Actually, many people's view of prolife are  colored  by their actions. In the extreme, the bombings and murders (yes, I know most prolife condemnn this, but some don't).  To a lesser degree thet incessant lies on the prolife sites (I bet you are hard pressed to find a major anti-abortion site that doesn't claim abortion causes breast cancer, when this has cathegorically been disproved.)  And then the ongoing denial of the woman as a person in her own right instead of chattel that can be forced to give of her bodily resources against her will.  So no, a single silly outburst by one ignorant poster, be it a teen or not, is not going to change the opinion of PL much."

2440,"Sorry, I don’t know PA’s law or if there is a link to it. Va follows the old common law rules for self defense. From what I have read of the new (and much criticized by the media elite) Florida self defense bill, it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense, where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force. The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it. The reporter said with disbelief in his voice (the kind of “my God what are they doing!” panic you hear when someone passes a law they don’t like) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime. My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system. Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime, whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America, that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy:THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction.There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence.A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.In any event, I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the “wild, wild west,” “traffic accidents becoming shootouts,” and Fla. becoming the “gunshine state.” These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law. I believe they will prove just as ignorant now as they did then."
2441,"oh it gets better.... Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control"" 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are ""just statistics.""4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should ""put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run"" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a ""state"" militia.14. These phrases: ""right of the people peaceably to assemble,"" ""right of the people to be secure in their homes,"" ""enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,"" and ""The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people"" all refer to individuals, but ""the right of the people to keep and bear arm"" refers to the state.15. ""The Constitution is strong and will never change."" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't ""military weapons"", but private citizens shouldn't have ""assault rifles"", because they are military weapons.18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.19. The NRA's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign is responsible social activity.20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is ""an accident waiting to happen"" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are ""preying on their fears.""23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a ""weapon of mass destruction"" or an ""assault weapon.""27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do ""civilians"" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.33. We should ban ""Saturday Night Specials"" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.37. ""Assault weapons"" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to ""keep guns out of the wrong hands."" Guess what? You have the wrong hands"

They are the most tireless of all."

What if I had a religious belief that prevented me from performing my governmental tasks for Christians? Should that be respected as well?  They are paid to do their job. People who get to pick and choose what their  job  should entail because of their religious beliefs should find another form of work.  If when I was in the military, I had suddenly stood up and said,  Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.   Should that be respected and I keep my  job ?"

2463,"We don't ignore it. We look at the circumstances-all these stories are from civilizations/groups that live on or near flood plains. Floods are common place. Catastrophic floods, not so much.You, however, must ignore things. For example; where is the global layer of sediments which the flood would have had to have laid down? Such a sediment layer would be quite thick, and uniformly found around the globe, and would consist of particles sorted by density. We would expect to find no signs of life within this layer (no tracks or burrows, and no signs of growing plant life such as paleosols are tree roots). This sedimentary layer would show signs of being layed down in water. As well, any animal fossils (plant too), would be indiscrimately mixed. We would expect, for example, to find trilobites alongside modern day rays, rabbits with velociraptors, etc.Now, can you point out where such a global layer exists Archie? If it doesn't, that pretty much debunks the flood ""theory"". But you just ignore that don't you?"

In fact, we do not know the exact grounds on which he was declared a heretic because his file is missing from the records.All the same, he was burned for being a heretic."
2468,"So, you post a press release from the brookings institute, one that they could not even get any news agencies to pick up and print, and then accuse me of biased sources? Thats pretty rich. There is a fair to decent article about this at http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.a...20030127a.htmlRealistically, I don't know how many gun control laws there are nationwide. I know that the report cited by the brookings XXXXXX admits to ONLY reporting federal and state laws, but not local (I know that there are 34 local gun control laws where I live, including the all important one prohibiting you from carrying a shotgun into a feed store). This seems to me to be akin to counting up federal and state zoning ordnances and then claiming that there are only 300 laws about zoning in the US."

2473,"You've had problems with this in other threads. You've said that a modification to the genome is not new information, just 'altered' information, which makes no sense at all. You can't alter information. You can alter physical stuff so that it stops representing one piece of information and starts representing another, but the idea that the information has altered is way off base. I could turn any sentence into any other sentence - even into a sentence that has never been written before - just by tweaking the letters one by one. Is the end product not a 'new' sentence?"
2474,"I post here to better understand the reasons behind the pro-life position and to present my own conditional pro-choice arguements both in the hope of convincing others and to let my views stand up to scrutiny (so that I could adapt them if I heard a reasonable opposing arguement).  By the way, based on the  A Pole  thread, those who were ambivalent and had their views changed by this forum all changed to pro-choice, not to pro-life.

2478,"Yes, that's what he is saying. It seems that in your small, closeted little world of ignorance you aren't aware that a Roman Catholic would never refer to a priest as a preacher. Miller was talking about the ministers of the non-Eucharistic protestant sects, like yours, that rely more on words than deeds.However, original sin is a basic tenet of Catholicism. Your failure to know that is yet another sign of your ignorance. In fact, the source of your concept of original sin is Roman Catholicism, probably through several other invented religions."

2480,"Hi jitobear. I am also pro-choice. This comment jumped out at me, though. Do you think it's seen as awful do to cultural conditioning? Could this have it wrong? There is no scientific basis that it's a human person, at the stage of development when the vast majority of abortions occur. I worry that by suggesting it's so negative, it can't help but be a stigma on the woman who chooses to abort her pregnancy. No woman should feel the need to apologize in relation to abortion, which is just about control over one's own body."
2481,Facts to support your denial are not in evidence.

2483,"And you've never hesitated to make it sound like we want to do away with law, when in fact, we're just pointing out that criminals won't follow them if they're passed."
2484,Nope not kidding. Matter has a CONTINUUM of complexity. At some point in that CONTINUUM we assign (in a rather imprecise way) the property of Life to the matter concerned. Other less complex matter is assigned the abstract property dead or non-living. If you were more familar with the true range of complexity which matter exhibits you would be aware that the division is rather arbitrary. For example people have much difficulty on agreeing on whether viruses are living or non-living matter. And its clear that while you cannot analyze complexity in matter that it does exist. Its there and its real and its a lot more real than simple taxonomic categories like lfe and non-life are.
2485,and tell me what did you gain out of making this statement? Just to let you know... the Bible (if you would actually read it in context instead of reading a little portion that you want to and interpret it the way you want outside of its context).. teaches how to love... because God is love.. and laid down his own life so that we could be FREE! hmmm.... sounds like the motto of what our troops do for our country... they lay their lives down because they want us to be free... where do you think this  ideology  comes from???
2486,"i like this. lets assume that both are mattes of faith, in that there is the unknown element in both cases (which there is). the only thing left is which fits reality bestthe evidence that supports creation is a book written by some middle-east religiously biased men about 4000 years ago. nothing in this book can be replicated or observed, and they defy observable realitythe evidence that supprts the theory of evolution is the observed reality that dna mutates, species that adapt to their environment survive, fossils exist, several aging mechanisms date the planet in the billions of years, and life forms in the millions, and so on. so, do we believe our own eyes, or what a very very old dtory tells us we should believe. thats what it really comes down to, all other things being equal"
2487,"Gay pride is positive, unlike what these people are doing. Do you have some information regarding a gay rights ad campaign that can be compared to this one?  I laughed when I first saw the ad on MSNBC's Hardball tonight. It shows the fear, insecurities and the fallacies that guide anti-gay equality rights activists."
2488,"To be able to do  anything , including things outside the knowable, is unintelligble. You cannot even being the argument because you are arguing the unknowable, which is, unknowable. That's the root. You can no more argue that god can participate in the unknowable, than you can do any rational examiniation of anything that has the attribute of being unknowable. It's meaningless.  If on the other hand you are starting with the premise that god is some entity that resides in the knowable universe, and is also knowable, then we can discuss this. And then  god  cannot also be the creator of the universe, which means I can probably stop right there in the debate.  Jim's claim of  god is omnipotent and omniscient, is equally nonsensical.  Ominpotence cannot be understood, it's unknowable.  But, to tie this all back into a more useful example:  If God is omniscient, he knows everything that will happen and has happened.  If God is omnipotent, he can do anything.  That's contradictory. If he knows what will happen, then he cannot change what will happen, and is thus, not omnipotent. These are contradictory.  So theists can choose, either to discuss meaningless things (unknowable), or to admit that there is no god by classic definition.  -Mach"
2489,Human rights?  Is a human fetus (a human child in the fetal stage of their life) not a human life?  Do I even need to bother with linking to a dictionary on this one anymore?  Just one word;  Hypocrisy 
2490,"Actually, according to your use of the word ""person,"" she is. A significant percentage of fertilized eggs fail to implant and are instead passed. How sad (and typical) that you haven't bothered to educate yourself about these things."
2491,"That is why scatter charts - such as the one that Adept produced - show figures per 1,000 population or whatever. It makes the data between countries directly comparible. A higher percentage of Americans are murdered every year than in any other  western  country save for N. Ireland (a region wracked by decades of near civil war, military occupation and terrorism).  Can you back up this claim?  Not true. The highest level of crime recorded in Florida was in 1988, the year after the concealed carry law was passed.  You have no evidence to back up that claim at all."
2492,"Wrong. There are a number of views on genesis.  1) Genesis is a literal story  2) Genesis is false as a literal story  3) Genesis is a metaphorical story to explain the origin of the world to people without a understand of the world much less science.  4) Genesis is merely a story that provides the setting for the morals and values of Christanity.  personally 3 makes the most sense to me.  Trying to explain astrophysics, evolution and general science to ignorant, nomadic israelites is quite retarded. If I was trying to do it, I'd have a similar form of genesis as well.  Plus you're forgetting that the flood and creation stories are just rip offs of enuma elish and Gilgamesh. They aren't even Christian in origin"
2493,"So you deny that this man is a victim? Realize that the gunshot drew attention, and attention is something criminals don't want. Maybe without that gunshot, the guy would've been beaten to death. But I suppose you'd be happier, because at least the old man wasn't a gun owner. Or I suppose you think he should've let the criminal have the money; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."
2494,"Worthless quote. Creationists are known for grossly quoting out of context, as well as relying on outdated sources, and, the Creationist doesn't even give a source in order to anyone to check up on his quote.Here's a Creationist-style quote for him: the Bible says, ""There is no god"". "
2495,"Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:  1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.  2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood."
2496,"And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically (read: deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with (for example) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time) in order to work.  I can't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards."
2497,"you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise."
2498,"But what is adultery?Mark 10:11:And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.Matthew 19:9:And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance. According to Mark, all putting away is adultery, but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him. Which is it?"
2499,"And that (among a number of other reasons) is why I will probably never, ever live in the state of California. Personally I have no desire to live somewhere that won't let me take the means to adequately defend my family and myself, if necessary."
2500,"Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said ""You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term."" I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted."
2501,"No they're not....do zoos document the changes in phenotype that no-doubt occur? This is not the zoo's job -- their job is not experimentation on animals -- that's science's job. Besides that, zoos do their darndest to house the animals in habitats that mimic the animals' natural settings.

2503,"I think you are right.  One of my favorite Sidney Harris cartoons was two scientists coming out of a conference presentation, and one, absolutely thrilled, says to the other,  What a wonderful talk - everything we know is wrong! "
2504,"Thank you for basically admitting that Pandion's argument is correct. We did not evolve from apes. Apes didn't even exist. We evolved from primitive primates, along with apes, chimps, orugantans, etc. How would they evolve into a new species of human? That would require them to be on a very similar evolutionary path as us, and obviously, they are not. Just like a shark cannot evolve into barracuda, they cannot evolve into a human."
2505,"Well the continual occurrence of shootings at schools that outlaw concealed carry, vs the lack of any shootings at schools that allow concealed carry, would suggest something along those lines."
2506,"the later the better, it seems to me :)"
2507,"Typicall response from the liberals on this thread has been to devise a plan to control crime, then worry about the civil rights violations later. The first principle of the liberals here has been  workability  and  practically , not civil rights.  When challenged with a root cause that both sides have agreed upon, it is still the probelm is still guns. When challenged with a solution that addresses the  workability  and  practically  of civil rights as a first principle and a root cause that both sides have agreed upon, the problem liberals focus on is still guns.  To pull a quote from an anti gunner on this board, please forgive the mis quote and feel free to correct me if I am wrong :  I do not need guns, never have needed them , and never will.   How about an open mind?"
2508,"Actually, we do. These inconsistant laws are a product of pro-life people trying to create a stepping stone to a national ban.  Crimes against pregnant women should warrant a more serious offense, not an entirely new offense."

2510,"But you can drink and drive, you just cannot be intoxicated over a certain limit and drive. There is no test possible in the field (like a breathylizer used for alcohol) that would allow for testing of THC levels. It should be like anything else, if you are causing a problem or showing visible signs of impairment, you get detained and taken for further testing, which they can actually draw a THC level on you in a lab. And since you bring it up, marijuanna does not slow down reaction times near as much as alcohol. Alcohol is far more physically impairing than even high doses of THC."
2511,Nope. How do you figure?
2512,"That has nothing whatsoever to do with my post that you replied to. I was agreeing with a post by Flygirl which pointed out that the hospital displayed a basic lack of common decency, which I trust you also agree with. Gay marriage or not, the hospital could have and should have allowed visitation. After all, some hospitals do--they are each a business and can do as they choose. There is a lot of activism going on in terms of getting hospitals to do this. See Gay rights groups launch hospital rating system, and the report itself."
2513,"So in short the best case scenario is we go from $6,000 per capita to.......$6,000 per capita. Basically this would mean less care for the already insured and more care fore the under insured..well, some of them.  This seems optimistic to me."
2514,Sure.  Step 1: Assume a miracle.  Step 2: Whatever you like.  And given your assumption you can not logically be shown to be wrong. It would take someone of strong intellectual character to avoid such an easy out.
2515,"Attending church cuts risk of death?Methinks your little website is biased.As for stem cell research, I am for whatever works best. We should not compromise on something worse than stem cells because of a moral issue. Stem cells are simply cells, nothing more. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous.However, if adult stem cells hold the key, and are more promising than embryotic stem cells, fine. Whatever works best, but this is not a moral debate. This is a science debate. To suggest this has something to do with advocating for a woman's right to abortion is absurd. This is about helping people only, born people. Real people."
2516,"First of all, it's not pro evo, it's pro evidence. But I guess that is kinda the same, as all the evidence points to evolution. Second, evolution's not a lie, it is supported by the evidence. Third evolution says nothing about god.But alright, I'll make you a compromise, refute the list on this forum then. But remember, please use evidence in this refuting, not mere assertions."
2517,"“Fruit” is a name we give to identify a physical object; the laws of logic are not physical.When you say “fruit” exists you can show its existence in the physical world. If the laws of logic exist, then show me. For one thing, atheism cannot account for a universal concept that is not material, and does not depend on our thinking. In addition to that, I am using the same argument atheist’s use against the existence of God to get the atheist to show me the existence of the laws of logic. Atheists say, “Show me God” I cannot see him. Theist describe that the universe cannot exist without God by showing the affects of God in the material universal (design) Show me the laws of logic, where is it? I cannot see it. Using apples is describing it is not the law itself. Just like I describe the evidence of Gods existence.The laws or logic are not universal? Again, you are using matter to show something that is non-material, I can look at fruit until I am blue in the face but that only describes concepts, it is not the laws of logic itself. "
2518,So what?
2519,Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality.
2520,I know that you are a contrarian that gioes out of his way to argue nonsensical points.
2521,So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(
2522,"Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the ""right"" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say ""All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages"". Since we have ""a government for the people by the people"", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else."

2529,"The problem is that there is no test the staff can administer to determine love. They can't tell if someone is really a loved one, or just some freak off the street that gets off on looking at unconscious people.

I suspect that you too, are scientifically illiterate and lack the knowledge to dicern where he is feeding you a line of crud.Really, it's not hard to figure out if you have the integrity to look for the real facts.

(Nevermind that the crux of ID is that it demands an evolutionary mechanism for the appearance of alleged IC/""unevolvable"" systems; the ID philosophy totally sidesteps that requirement.)3) Again, the validity of ID depends not on the designer's choices but only on the designer interacting at all.4) OEC/IDists will claim that environmental conditions have changed over millions of years just like mainstream science says they have; after all, some IDists ""don't doubt"" mechanisms such as natural selection. For the obvious problem of the designer ""letting"" species go extinct, see answer 3.I'm guessing that YEC/IDists will just point to the flood.And the conspiracy theorist/IDists will blame Satan for trying to mislead people.5) Not a single one.

ID simply sidesteps these issues.Also notice that none of the statements are testable or falsifiable, except for the parts of the OEC view that are perfectly compatible with geology and evolution. Some will claim that they ""have no reason"" to doubt common descent (a la Behe) but do a conspicuously good job of not saying they actually believe it.And if any IDists have a problem with my responses, they're able to post their own responses. However, they were able to do that even before I responded, and they didn't..."
2560,"The main purpose of the Free Exercise Clause is to prevent the government from outlowing or seriously burdening a person's pursuit of whatever religion, and whatever religious practices, he chooses.  How does the teaching of current scientific theory violate that?"
2561,"http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...sd/grocott.aspSo who decides what is or isn't science? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress? Every subject taught in school is different, but science is, (and has to be) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge.2) Let's look at the dictionary.com definition of religion;"

Violent crimes from 1996 to 2007 (per 100,000 persons per year) Homicide is pretty much a flat line no? However there violent crime is not. And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?"
2571,"Indeed.If a teacher teaches 'the controversey' correctly, and lays out the facts and let's kids decide for themselves (is that done for ANY subject?), certainly, the most indoctrinated will say creation wins. But what about the open-minded? What about the students that can actually grasp the fact that creationism offers nothing in the way of supporting evidence? that is rests solely on trying to poke holes in evolution and appeals to biblical authority? Those students will conclude that creatiomnism is bogus, and may cause them to question their 'beliefs.'Two things could happen:1. the Right -wing zealots will enforce laws making it a crime to put creationism ina poor light, forcing teachers to bow down or be fired. Conservative correctness with the force of law.2. the Right-wing zealots will realize that their little plan backfired, and let the issue die Scarily, if this should come to pass, if things do not change much politically, I see option 1 as the most likely.During the Cold War, politicians had 'godless Soviet atheism' to rally against with religious fervor. The Conservatives are now latching onto Fundamentalist Islam as the new 'Red Horde'. And lots of gullible people arebuying into it."

There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always.  In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves.  Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases."

2583,"I think pro-gun extremists' stubborn and uncompromising opposition to even small amounts of gun control appears unreasonable to a lot of people and turns people against them. The pro-gun side plays a role in creating their own enemies. One example of this happening is the case of Sarah Brady. In her own words:""Dorothy and the manager of the company stopped by in their pickup truck with the idea that [we] would go swimming. Scott got in first, and I climbed in behind him. He picked up off the seat what looked like a toy gun and started waving it around. I took [it] from him, intending to say he must never point even a toy gun at anyone. As soon as I got it into my hand, I realized it was no toy. It was a fully loaded little Saturday night special, very much like the one that had shot Jim.""I cannot even begin to describe the rage that went through me. To think that my precious little boy, 6 years old, had actually held a loaded .22 pushed me right over the edge. I handed the gun to Dorothy. I didn't want to see it again, I said—get rid of it. The manager made some lame excuse about how he had to have it for self-protection against union members. I didn't reply.""Days later Sarah heard a report that the National Rifle Association was pushing a bill known as McClure-Volkmer, which called for the repeal of a Federal gun-control law passed in 1968.""Instantly, all the fury that had hit me in the pickup truck came rushing back. I knew the 1968 law well. It was a sensible measure that essentially set age limits for gun buyers, imposed some I inspection and bookkeeping requirements on gun dealers and banned the import of Saturday night specials. I picked up the phone and called the National Rifle Association's Washington headquarters. I said, 'My name is Sarah Brady, and you've never heard of me, but I am going to make it my life's ambition to try to put you out of business.'

No, for murdering innocent babies in the womb by performing abortions that were not necessary but just being done as a means of birth control........."
2588,One has to wonder why gun haters always ask this quesion. Has this question ever been asked of people that read books? It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like. The gun haters clearly like the 1st amend. The gun haters use their 1st amend right to attack the right to bear arms. When racist use their 1st amend right to attack other peoples right it is called hate speech. So why is it that gun haters demanding the banning of the right to bear arms is not considered hate speech? After all gun haters are just like the other hate groups. All they do is attack the right to bear arms. Not once has a gun hater ever demand that dangerous criminals be punished.

2593,"Yes, it means the kind of regulations that would be necessary to create an effective militia, not necessarily those aimed at protecting public safety.

2595,Well I like Hoppe's argumentation ethics approach.
2596,"Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger, ""dangerous knife"" or razor ""with intent to use the same unlawfully"". Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against ""undesirable"" elements. Sponsor ""Big Tim"" Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train."
2597,"Indeed.The genetic code sure is interesting. Whatever the explanation for the origins of the code, whether intentional agency, only RV+NS, self-organization or a combination of these, the fact that these processes converged on a single, reasonably optimal code that is able to facilitate evolution makes it look like it was an inevitable result from the system. The system seems to be rigged and biased towards certain outcomes similar to the evolution of life."
2598,"But you can drink and drive, you just cannot be intoxicated over a certain limit and drive. There is no test possible in the field (like a breathylizer used for alcohol) that would allow for testing of THC levels. It should be like anything else, if you are causing a problem or showing visible signs of impairment, you get detained and taken for further testing, which they can actually draw a THC level on you in a lab. And since you bring it up, marijuanna does not slow down reaction times near as much as alcohol. Alcohol is far more physically impairing than even high doses of THC."

They willing hunt down old friends and kill them ( or help to kill them). In the Passion (name of a chimp - Jane named hers) case, the female monkey deliberately found other female members of her own tribe when they were alone and too far away for the others to hear cries of help, and with the help of her children ripped the babies from their mothers and proceded to eat them in front of the mothers. Then as if they had done nothing wrong they would go up and touch the mother ""lovingly"".Some people can say these show human traits (Jane does), however, while it is common for animals to kill and feel no remorse for it, many humans feel horrible remorse even if they were not directly responsible for killing another human. Some even feel remorse for killing animals. Whether you agree they are human traits or not, you must agree that most humans have some sense of justice. I do not see that sense of justice in all of Jane's research."

Besides that, God would never be presented with any kind of problem, much less a problem of overpopulation. Good grief, to suggest that the God who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the Bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs.

Sales of that simple ingredient were banned in my state by politicians claiming it would 'dry up' meth production. No support whatsoever from LE due to the simple fact that cheap finished product from Canada and Mexico would simply flood the market, eliminating the need for local production, expand usage by increased availability and fill up our jails with the aftermath of crimes against property and people. Guess what? That's exactly what's happening. Christian morality regarding abortion and drugs might be the predominate factor in many of our criminal statutes, but there's certainly no doubt it's a cost we can no longer afford on a social or financial basis."

2627,"The way it works in Kansas, the state board of education sets the guidelines and sends them out to all the school districts where they sit in a box in a closet somewhere. During much of the time when all this idiocy was going on, I was ON the local school board and had never once opened one of those books. We all knew they existed, and nearly half of us knew where ours were, it was just not something that anybody generally cares to look at. I would be shocked if you could find me 10 kids in the entire state who have ever read the state school boards definition of ""science"" or their guidelines. It is just not something that comes up. IMO, that is why this issue came up in kansas. Our state school board here has VERY little power or control, so nobody really pays attention to them. When the first set of changes occured, there was a lag of about 6 months before anybody even realized it and then it was somebody from the media."
2628,"Well, that's not quite right. Science is a methodology for investigating phenomena, not an enumeration of them. So it is perfectly possible to scientifically investigate, say, the power of prayer. Consider for a moment what you actually mean by 'materialistically': what is it that defines something as being material? Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle, yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world. Why? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method: assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested. If ghosts and poltergeists were amenable to the same methodology, it would be possible to construct scientific theories concerning those, too, and they would be considered no more exotic or 'supernatural' than clouds or rainbows.When you get your head around that, it's immediately apparent that it isn't the power of prayer or spirituality per se that aren't scientific, it's the methodology people have for dealing with them. Indeed, when the scientific method is applied and doesn't yield the results believers in such matters want, the typical response is to come up with excuses why we shouldn't expect the scientific method to work. Unfortunately you can't have it both ways; if you want to come to the party you have to adopt the dress code.Really, none of this would be a problem if science didn't have a (from a religious perspective) nasty habit of finding explanations for, or hidden and unexpected complexities within, features of the material world about which religious texts or leaders had already made firm pronouncements. Because despite the fact that you, SS, and others see science and evolution as an enemy of your philosophy and spirituality, the actual bone of contention is always in the material world. So who's really treading on whose toes here? It's your choice to shackle your spirituality to a particular - and demonstrably wrong - version of material events, SS, not mine."
2629,"Wilkinson is as full of **** as you are. When we brought the Heller case before the Supreme Court, we wanted them to determine whether or not DC's handgun laws, which weren't voted on but rather just passed without debate, were constitutional or not. That's the job of the Supreme Court, to determine if a law is unconstitutional or if it may be allowed to remain as law.Your standard of pressing legislators to pass one law to repeal another is just plain stupid. The only ones who we could ask to do such are the DC people who threw their full support behind the DC gun ban, proclaiming that it was both constitutional and reasonable, and should be allowed to remain. There was absolutely no way of using the ballot to get anything done.And another thing. There's absolutely no political agenda here, whatsoever.

2632,"As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to ""purpose."" And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time ""survival of the fittest"" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."

Which is also why you won't be able to prove that creationism is wrong, and why we can't prove evolution is wrong. The focus must be on proving one right. How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought."

2642,"And there you go again.. first of all, misrepresenting all the things everyone has said, and second of all, bringing up that red herring of 'In God We Trust'. You see, you are mixing up what your basic beliefs are with how you are acting. I do think it is very amusing that the Knights of Columbus, in an effort to 'show how different we are from the Godless Commies"" have tricked the Christians of this country into the worshiping of Idols. They turned the pledge into a prayer, and the flag into an idol, and Money into a God.Do keep on bringing up all these things about 'Noah's ark' and such. I guess you hear a sound bit on TV, and believe it hook line and sinker. It demonstrates to me what has to be changed in the schools on that we should teach people how to listen critically, and to actually learn things. I find that knowledge is the enemy of both religion and right wing fundamentalism.

It was so lopsided, the global-warming-is-caused-by-man advocate fled the debate halfway through."
2652,"What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842)."

2668,"So what the hell does that have to do with anything... oh and do not tell me that the AWB was the reason... Assault weapons are used in less than .20% of crimes:   Assault weapons are not the weapons of choice among drug dealers, gang members or criminals in general. Assault weapons are used in about one-fifth of one percent (.20%) of all violent crimes and about one percent in gun crimes. It is estimated that from one to seven percent of all homicides are committed with assault weapons (rifles of any type are involved in three to four percent of all homicides). However a higher percentage are used in police homicides, roughly ten percent. (There has been no consistent trend in this rate from 1978 through 1996.) Between 1992 and 1996 less than 4% of mass murders, committed with guns, involved assault weapons. (Our deadliest mass murders have either involved arson or bombs.)    Whats your point?"

2672,"Yes Chrstians should be disarmed so the ""moral"" atheists, humanists, pagans who crucified people should rule over us . . . that would give everyone a warm fuzy feeling inside.Matt 26: 1 And it happened, when Jesus finished all these sayings, He said to His disciples, 2 You know that the Passover is coming after two days, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. Of course there are valid reasons why Christ armed His men.Romans 13: 1 Let every soul be subject to higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, but the existing authorities have been ordained by God. 2 So that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves. 3 For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 5 Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. 6 For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 7 Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.Luke 11: 21 When the strong one, having been armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace. 22 But as soon as one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him; he takes away his armor on which he relied, and deals out his arms.

2677,"Oh, WJA, what a neat little trick. The claim had been made by your side... that he hadn't published an attempt to apply his filter. And, that he was running scarred. Are you now asking me to show where he has successfully demonstrated his filter, or are you asking me if he's attempted to demonstrate his filter...? And now you want his publication in a particular form too! Another slight of hand.Despite this I countered that he has published.I said Dembski had come up with a filterThe accusation was that he hadn't applied this to a biological system.Yet everyone seems to be able to critique this 'invisible' application.Now with typical aplomb WJA chimes in and you don't go down the path of SLP in actually making any claim. You want me to come up with the goods.This is the neat trick. You've diverted things away from SLP's ludicrous and biased claim.The claim was made by SLP without any proof.The onus is on SLP to provide such proof. I have shown otherwise even if it is 'second hand evidence'. The inference from all the critiques quite clearly suggest that they have seen it applied, and reject it as a failure.Nice try WJA. A small shift again of the argument.However, because I'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following.""In the actual encounter, Dembski began by overviewing his methods for design detection as developed in The Design Inference. He then  sketched how these methods apply to biology  and why he thought they provided in-principle objections to undirected natural causes, including Kauffman's self-organizational processes, generating the key item that his methods detect, namely, specified complexity or complex specified information. Dembski developed his argument as follows: the only way for self-organizational, Darwinian, and other naturalistic methods to generate specified complexity is by in essence dissolving the actual complexity (or improbability). What seems highly improbable is therefore no longer improbable once one knows the right naturalistic process. Dembski indicated that there were good reasons to think that no such reduction of complexity or improbability would be possible in the case of systems like the bacterial flagellum.  He also adverted to some of the techniques developed in his forthcoming book titled ""No Free Lunch"" for computing the probabilities of discrete combinatorial objects like the bacterial flagellum. ""http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_011119.htmThis suggests that a book is about to appear mysteriously out of the ether...So, go read the book  ""No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased Without Intelligence"". Unless you think it's not 'published'.Oh, look it has been published! It's a miracle.As far back as post 29 the answer was provided for one and all by SLP who wrote:""Unfortunately, Dembski and his ""explanatory"" filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have 'discovered' desing (sic) in nature by using the 'filter', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in ""Mere Creation"", then he said it would be iun (sic)  No Free Lunch  - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is (sic) just assumed that he has done so?""The simple answer is 'yes he has'.This mystery book exists. It's even been criticised by people on your side ""In his book, No Free Lunch,  Dembski presents the bacterial flagellum as the premier example of a biological system that, because he judges it to be both complex and specified, must have been actualized by the form-conferring action of an unembodied intelligent agent. However, a critical examination of Dembski?s case reveals that, 1) is is built  on unorthodox and inconsistently applied definitions of both ?complex? and ?specified,? 2) it employs a concept of the flagellum?s assembly that is radically out of touch with contemporary genetics and developmental biology, and 3)  it fails to demonstrate  that the flagellum is either ?complex? or ?specified? in the manner required to make his case. If the bacterial flagellum is supposed to demonstrate ID, then ID is a failure.""http://www.iscid.org/ubbcgi/ultimate...=1;t=000057;p=As I said, people on your side are out there criticising him all the time. How could they unless he had published?Also, it is one thing to say that he hasn't attempted to apply the filter, then to say that he has attempted to apply it and failed.;) Game, set and match"
2678,"I said in my OP I believe the genes are just a physical manifestation of the mind. They are all a part of the circle of life....of course you couldn't have one without the other.  Well that's just like a good darwinist to make a ridiculous challenge. What I can show, however, is that thoughts, emotions and social settings can re-express genes, which can lead not only to a change in phenotype, but also to new, heritable traits passed down to future generations. You guys' hypothesis that it takes a new or changed gene for  evolution  (ie..change in population over time) to take place is unsupported, unscientific, un-proven -- and ultimately wrong."

2680,"Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups."
2681,"haha, probably very smart of you ;) It gets heated in here"
2682,"What do I have against abortion? Hmmm, let me think. I guess there is that little fact that it is MURDER! But besides that ""opinion"", it does effect me because it effects society in a negative way. Do you just choose to ignore the studies on the terrible emotional and physical problems women have after they have abortions? Look here  to see what I mean. Do a search for ""effects of abortion"" on the Web and see if you don't find many more studies with the same results. I could have posted many more links. Maybe you don't know about these studies since the leftist media and women's groups tends to ignore them. Maybe you just ignore them because they don't fit into your world view. Either way, the facts are there."
2683,"But I'm not debating philosophy, WW; I'm debating evolutionary theories."
2684,"There are some very rare cases where abortion is legitimately allowable by society. However, most abortions do not fall under this catagory."
2685,"See above. Whether a couple is or isn't monogomous is not for you to determine or worry about. And speak for yourself if you don't mind. This member of the American public's mental health is just fine thank you very much. If gay marriage impacts YOU that much, well that sounds like your problem."
2686,"And a woman's life choices, health, and finances aren't up for hi-jacking. Every time a lifer talks about demanding the nine month rape, they talk about what the baby deserves or not deserves and how it shouldn't be punished. This SCREAMS that you don't value and respect women. The very idea that a woman is aborting as an act of revenge - it's absurd and insulting."
2687,"Where did Vitter lie ? He admitted his wrong doing and apologised to his wife. Had a liberal been accused he would have attacked the leak as a Right Wing attack designed to destroy him with the politics of personal destruction. The double standards are a joke. Out of 10,000 different names she has released, do you really think there are no Democrats on that list ? But ABC has those phone records so they can release a different Republican on the list every month to demonize the Right while never exposing the libs on the list, thereby creating a totally false impression of the real story that people from both sides of the aisle are guilty of indiscretions."
2688,"So now anytime you don't like something, you're going to whine and bemoan it until there's a law passed that makes it illegal, so it can't possibly ever happen again?Where does a mentality like that stop? Are you going to push for it to be illegal for a parent to let their child go out and play without first applying sunscreen so they don't get burned?"
2689,"Hillarious. I remember seeing that a while back. That's liberals for you, the laws they propose are for the 'peasants', not for them to obey. They, afterall, are better suited for making decisions like these than you. You need them to think for you.. to care for you.. cradle to grave.You may also recall that famed anti-gunner Rosie O'Donnell has armed bodyguards but says you shouldn't have guns yourself. You cannot be trusted, afterall. And who was that writer who shot the kid in the hand that was swimming in his pool late one night? Carl something. Another anti-gunner who preaches 'do as I say, not as I do'.Liberals.. LOL!"
2690,"They found that it violated their state constitutions, right? This has nothing to do with the US Constitution."
2691,"Actually, most people do not hold the view that existing marriages should be dissolved. In Massachussetts, it's quite a minority view, almost as low as Bush's approval rating.In any case, that is irrelevant. I was pointing out why someone might reasonably ask the question you consider so inappropriate. What I haven't seen, either from you or from any of the articles, was what the firefighter's answer was or why he refused to answer.

2695,"Yes it does, by the definition of existence. We can't determine whether something exists or not if we do not define  existence.  I define it like this:  If something exists, then it can be detected.  If something cannot be detected, then it doesn't exist.  Note that the converses are not necessarily true.  Theists define  God  as something that cannot be detected. Therefore, their god does not exist. Pantheists define  God  as the universe. Polytheists define their gods as superhumans who live on top of mountains. This proof cannot disprove pantheism or polytheism, but it disproves theism."

2697,"You contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis."
2698,"Ummm, no. How could I possibly be forcing my beliefs on you when my view is for each person to have a choice. Your view is to force society to do away with all abortions."
2699,"No, but I agree with him that we should all be able to find our own spirituality without the religious hound dogs tracking us down.  I don't think he would agree with how you and others approach the religious posts in this forum either.  Even though I don't agree with everything I read of him, which is not much, I do think he's on the right track. I hope he can find the answers he's looking for.

2700,Just for the record:
2701,"Oh deary me, no. Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :)"
2702,"You've avoided the question. God does not fill the word ""who"" because to most accounts he is not a person, or being.  But for your sake I will restate the question. Who is God? Describe God to me. What is that you believe in?"

2704,"Why not tell us in your own words, since you have made such claims?  If all of your sources agree with you, then they are not relevant to the debate. Let's assume ever source you name agrees with your point of view, and from there, you can answer the questions.  -Mach"
2705,"You seem to think that any time someone is killed, the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator  devalued human life . If that was the case, gun manufacturers, car manufacturers, breweries, and cigarette manufacturers would  devalue human life  simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse. And the government would  devalue human life  by letting these companies operate under it. We do not go targeting innocent civilians. More often than not, the civilians are killed by Iraqi suicide bombers or  militia , and the few that are killed by the US are accidents."
2706,"You go to hell when you do not ask for FORGIVENESS from your sins and ask Christ to govern your life and help you to stop sinning. I am still a sinner, but I am forgiven and I ask Christ daily to help me with my fleshly desires."
2707,Well they'd be the experts on it; most of their members have been ruled as fitting under said category.  Let's face facts. Nobody who's in their right mind could actually believe the kind of nonsense they spread.
2708,"But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against ""choices"" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices."
2709,"Yes, but what I meant about the legislature passing it is that the legislature could fund it. If there is funding, it becomes a funded mandate.

Reducing it to subsytems, and those subsystems to material and mechanical components, is a task subordinate to the principal, primary objective, i.e., an understanding of the whole, what is it that it is, why it does what it does, and how it does it. Only you anthropocentrically expand your psychological understanding of connotations of words pertaining to human social systems to all other systems, everywhere. But that is, of course, what you guys did when first you applied the term 'selection' to the behaviour of abstractions and other non-human entities, so no big surprise there, I guess."

2716,"Actually, there is, my poor addle-minded friend. Indeed, you can argue that she was even exercising her responsibility as a citizen with more civic-mindedness than many because she non-violently and patiently refused to sign the ticket.

2717,"Excellent post DamEtel, I'm continually impressed by your very knowledgeable and thorough contributions here.  The response you received was exactly what I was expecting.  When faced with evidence so powerful that a pseudoscience cannot even be developed to offer an alternate explanation (ID theory, flood geology, etc..), the reply is inevitably baseless if and buts, or the old standby -   The Lord works in mysterious ways.   To actually face the data head on would present a fundamental challenge to one's faith and religion, and that, as I'm sure you're aware, will be avoided at all cost.  Waxy"

2719,"Well, then we get into the sticky area of 'what exactly is a right' and 'where do they come from'.Personally, I believe that a right is simply a type of behaviour that is socially permissable. It doesn't have to be encouraged or enjoyed, it just has to be tolerated. Now, there is a difference between what rights people actually have, and what rights you think people should have. They don't have to come from some outdated and irrelevant constitution, and certainly aren't granted by any mythical god."
2720,Perhaps Jitobear would like to write this person a letter stating she supported her mothers choice to end her life.  If she could go back in time and given the chance I wonder if she would make sure the job was finished.
2721,"You know, I think that you are rather an evil person, trying to create guilt where no guilt exists, where no guilt is necessary. Someone made a very important decision at a critical point in her life which made her life better and averted the consequences of a stupid mistake made by a youth. It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it's well in the past, except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it.Why don't you try to make George Walker Bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of Iraq, for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children, for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young Americans who left behind mourning mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation's horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives.But, I guess that when one worships the Almighty Fetus, the lives of real people are of no concern."
2722,"And again, how is this relevant to a discussion of science as opposed to ""creation science?"" What does virtue have to do with it? To be honest, I have never been impressed by the superior virtue of christians anyway. The highest divorce rate of any population in the country is among born again christians (Gallup). I haven't been divorced and have never cheated on my wife. Who is more virtuous?"
2723,"When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship, I heavily researched both options, as well as parenting. I looked into requirements for Medicaid, WIC, and other subsidized assistance offered in my community. I called a few clinics around town. That's an interesting story, but not for here.I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints.I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health.Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated.I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later.I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health. I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish, and essentially it is, since it was made with my best interests in mind. I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish, they understand the reasons why I made that decision. And if it was your wife, daughter, friend, and she was dealing with what I was, you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy."
2724,You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.
2725,"#1 - Evolution continues today. Some organisms evolve relatively quickly. It has and is being observed. Do some research.#2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena. It must have happened by itself if there is no Creator. There are several theories about the specifics. I happen to think lightning was involved. #3 - It is thought humans evolved ""away"" from the other apes due to environmental pressures. When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate. That change in climate forced our ancestors from the trees which somehow contributed to our ""rapid"" and unprecedented brain development.#4 - Geology and radioactive isotopes."
2726,Currently none however all the western powers operated this way in the 19th century and people suffered. Let conservatives dismantle regulations and it will be the return to the 19th century.
2727,"Actually, we have a pretty good idea of how life populates islands. And yes, it is pretty much by chance that things get carried to islands by any of several means. Your question/statement about two things happening exactly the same way doesn't seem to make sense."
2728,Its not very risky anymore...
2729,"I think it would be more valid to say ""Whenever a decision does not go our way, the first reaction should not be turn AGAINST the courts ...""And what other ""method"" is there for the minority who has the majority oppressing them?Is the minority supposed to turn to ""democracy"" for protection?Democracy was part of the reason they were being discriminated against in the first place!"
2730,"Hm, that does not seem to match the reading of Steven's dissent. He seems pretty set against incorporation.  [T]he right to possess a firearm of one&#8217;s choosingis different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term &#8220;liberty&#8221; encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms  and  In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly relevant to an assessment of petitioners&#8217; asserted right, there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case. The question we must decide is whether the interest in keeping in the home a firearm of one&#8217;s choosing&#8212;a handgun, for petitioners&#8212;is one that is &#8220;comprised within theterm liberty&#8221; in the Fourteenth Amendment  The practical impact of various gun-control measures may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should not be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive threat to the social order&#8212;and that reasonable restrictions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable burden on one&#8217;s personal liberty&#8212;is as old as the Republic. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a foundational premise of modern government that the State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence"
2731,"I believe you, OTHERS pick and choose what you believe. What is sad is how many lose their faith when they find how much they have been mislead."
2732,"Which, as stated, Darwin thought was in fact a better phrase, or 'more accurate'...""But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient."" from the 6th edition of ""Origin of the Species""http://www.literature.org/authors/da...hapter-03.html"
2733,"I think that's overly simplistic. I've spoken with alot of creationists, both in forums and in real life, and many of them are quite intelligent and well educated. The problem is that people have an amazing ability to filter out things that don't fit into their pre-conceived notions. I'm sure you've seen this in all sorts of different fields, it's just most pronounced when someone is denying facts, rather than refuting an opinion. If someone is devoutly religious, and firmly believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible, then facts which contradict that belief simply don't take hold. It's not that they don't understand logic or science. It's more like they've trained themselves to not hear things which go against their beliefs."
2734,"+1. I'm sure Obama will make a lot people unhappy in certain states on how he has managed, so far, the economic crisis (i.e. Michigan). An AWB would further deteriorate his support in other states like Virginia, North or South? Carolina, Florida, etc. Besides it is something he can avoid unlike the economic situation."
2735,"The scope of the conference was ONLY the discussion of illicit weapons trade on the international market. It had nothing at all to do with the ownership of weapons by private individuals EXCEPT as it pertained to the illicit sales of arms on the international market.THATS IT. NOTHING ELSE. They were not debating private ownership of arms, and such debates were discouraged. When a group from handgun control inc. attempted to give a presentation, they were politely told that the the scope of the conference did NOT include privae gun ownership by individuals. HEre is a link to the UNs goals:http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/They run from word hunger to economic reform to higher educational standadrds. There is nothing there about guns.Here is a link to their news page:http://www.un.org/News/You can also get a newsletter from them that is mailed right to your door every day to be read at your leisure.I don't really have any feelings about the UN one way or the other. They are a large force that helps shape world politics, so I follow what is going on there."

2737,"For the record, to interested parties reading -- subscribers to evolutionary biology or creationism -- I subscribe to evolutionary biology and having that taught in the public school system. And though I disagree with creationism, I support parents' right to teach their children creationism. For further information, please see the poll discussion."
2738,"What do you mean by 'Yet it still stands'? Are you saying that it has ultimate authority, or it is simply a cultural fairy tale that so many are frightened to discard?"
2739,"This is probably true, however it was your challenge to present a non-material approach to a physical observation.  This has now happened; with regards pain. Challenge over."
2740,And to quote from the OP:  In other words none of this is particulary new - its just another example of a possible H&amp;N hybrid. Not beyond the pale and not impacting on TOE.
2741,"I spoke no lies.I can substantiate my position WITH POLLS that actually ask the people leaving WHY they are leaving.Rather than listen to that, Archie would have us listen to people who are ENTRENCHED in REPEATING the very reasons why people are leaving Christianity...Such glaring misrepresentation of reality is obviously an act of a dinosaur complaining as it sinks into the tar pit.A logical person can very well ask ""If the reason people leave Christianity is because the religion is not adhering to biblical principles, then WHY do we STILL HAVE MOST CHRISTIANS thinking homosexuality is a sin?""Cause you see, changes like the above with the Lutherans DO NOT come about because most people WANT the church to be more strict...They come about because there are MORE people in the church who WANT the change."
2742,"The reason carbon dating is not being used on the remains is that even the most advanced C14 dating methods can only - even in principle - report a date within the last 60,000 years or so. Try to date something older and you'll get a result, but it won't be right. Nor will it be pegged to the 60,000 year end of the scale, like a redlined engine; it could come back with anything. The fossils in question have been dated via numerous other methods, all of which are in agreement - what the heck is the point of performing another test which you know will yield a 'young' result even if the fossil is old? What could such a test possibly tell us?Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand -"
2743,"Well maybe on the 4473 they could put a little box to check if you are a straw purchaser,maybe a psychic in the back room or ask them politely if they are straw purchasers."

2745,"Again, ecological factors play an important role. If the first birds were aggressive carnivores that attacked other aggressive dinosaurs, this may hold water. Yet their skeletal structure suggest that they were small, agile and light dinosaurs equipped for eating insects and such. The Theropods actually had to gain muscle to provide powered flight which was a later development.~Monkey"
2746,"As I pointed out, you don't understand what either evolution or natural selection are. Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies in inheritable characteristics in a population over generations. If the number of long haired animals became more frequent in the population, then evolution has occurred. Natural selection may (or may not) be the mechanism that caused the change."
2747,"Personally, I don't have a problem with a single thing you said.You made your CHOICE, and we in the Pro-Choice camp respect your right to choose.Now, just don't go around trying to impose your choice (which I personally think is perverted and sexist) on the women in my family.You have the obligation to respect their choices just as we respect yours.BTW, please tell Gush Limpbutt that there is a world of difference between human, i.e, possessing the right genes, and personhood, which begins at birth."
2748,"I've not honestly watched it yet (have crappy internet connection at the moment, might watch when I go home from Uni), but it could be just die to stimulus/response or a pure reflex. The brain could easily not be involved and its unlikely to be aware of what its doing, if its not just another artefact of the speeding up the film (i.e being poked and moving due to being manipulated but seeming to struggle rather than being moved)  Pro-choice and developmental biologists are quite different, I'd be worried if you had none on the pro-life side of the debate yet all agree on the period of time it takes for certain structures to develop."

2751,"That , of course, is the logical fallacy known as 'Personal incredibility"". The concept he promoted of ""irreducilble complex"" has been shown to be devoid of any meaning. All example he showed of 'gaps' in systems he proclaimed to be 'irredibly complex' have been shown to be reducible. Some were even found to be reducible even BEFORE his book ""Darwin's black box' was published. Those gaps in knowledge were filled in.What Behe was basiclaly saying is 'Gosh, we don't know, it must have been God'. We found out. God retreats. Yes, there are unknowns, and probably always will be. But our ignornace is not evidence of an intelligent designer.To promote an intelligent designer as a scientific theory, you have to have evidence FOR an intellient designer, rather than gaps in the knowlege of how biochemical systems formed.Believing in a God is fine, but it isn't science."
2752,"If transitional species is a large issue to overcome, I will post my rather lengthy explanation of the lack of transitional species, but perhaps it should suffice to say that we have found some evidence of transitional species, and even if we had not, the lack of transitional species provides no evidence of creationism."
2753,"The observable universe represents an event horizon, outside of which we cannot see. The actual extent of the universe beyond that is at present unknowable. Current versions of M-theory hold that our universe was formed from the collisions of branes in a higher dimension."
2754,"Again, logically incorrect. That's like saying there must be a world just like this one where water flows uphill - clearly that's nonsense: this world has been shaped by forces that ensure water flows downhill."
2755,"Oregon is another argument on behalf of a single payer health care system.  Now that some time has passed, we can see that they did NOT and do NOT have enough money to pay for it. Hospitals making value judgments on individuals' lives ... like who is more worthy of treatment? A cancer sufferer? Or someone with heart disease?  Pro-life means everyone gets health care. No ifs, ands or buts."
2756,A nonsensical concept. Genetic change is genetic change. Evolutionary theory doesn't contain any concept of progress. Only scientific illiterate creationists try to insist that it does.
2757,"Wait on, we are confusing our history here.  Catholic Church was a branch of The Church, along with the then Byzantine Orthodox domonination.  The Great Schism was between the Roman Catholic Church of the Papacy and the Orthodox Church of the Byzantine Empire. It took place in 1054 when the then Pope excommunicated the Byzantine Emperor from the Church (who, not to be out done responded with his own excommunication of the Pope).  They might of patched it up had it not been for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade initiated by Pope Innocent II. Oooops!  The Protestant Church was formed by Henry VIII when he declared himself head of the Church in England in 1534 in place of the Pope by the Act of Supremacy, so he could divorce and marry as nescessary. He never did get a fit male heir though....."
2758,"Questions I asked in a previous post, but to which I have never received a reply:Does God have genitalia? Why would he? To what possible purpose?  Does He have legs and feet? Why? What does he have to walk on?  How about nipples? A navel? A digestive tract? An anus? Lungs? Why would a non-corporeal being need any of these?  Why would an all-seeing being have eyes that limit him to seeing only forward as we do, especially before he'd even created Light?  God was made in Man's image, not the other way around."
2759,"And again, a creationist shows the belief that if you don't agree with them, you're an atheist."

2763,"So, you're basically saying that Biden was lying through his teeth when he said he doesn't support gay marriage? It was all just a lie to keep from losing votes? Interesting."
2764,"Actually it is more than that. Yes conservatives will be back in power, but I have never seen so much discontent in America period.  I don't know where we got off track but I think it is this. We are Americans, not Democrat or Republican. Our allegiance belongs to the Republic, not to any political group. While we fight and try to score some kind of political points with each and every event, America is burning. Sooner or later, while we bicker endlessly, the American People are going to be fed up with both parties, and move into something yet not discovered.  Heck, the way China is rising in material wealth, and while we mortgage our Children's futures so that we do not have to feel the pain, maybe we will be just presiding over the destruction of the greatest society even known to man.  All of this is possible unless we find the courage to work together for the good of all America, instead of just trying to play got ya with the other party.  It is what I said a few days ago. United we Stand and Divided We Fall!  However, I doubt the Chinese will be anywhere as benevolent as We the People were. But it seems clear that change is coming, but I sincerely doubt that is has very little to do with the kind of change Obama Envisioned!  So belly up to the bar and Get Some discontent Boys! After all we all have earned it!  We reap what we sow!"
2765,"For what it's worth, I certainly AM bothered by this if it's true. I'd like to see the source where you got that information about the abortion rate climbing under Bush's presidency, if you would. Of course, we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time."
2766,Love is not always about procreation. My grandfather remarried at age 70. I don't think he was worried about procreation.  The point you have made is old and washed up. Try a real argument rather than one that just shows your ignorance of the subject matter.
2767,"But you know what really doesn't make sense? Why are they evangelising to people (who they know most of them will reject them) if those people get a special dispensation? They'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing, would they not? Why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation?"
2768,"The 10 commandments are a real time story, told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to... Moses.Genesis, is a history lesson, told by a man who had no understanding of modern science, or the language to describe it in that fashion... Moses.If God chose to reveal to you in some special way, the origins of the universe, for you to write down for generations to come.. you would write a different story than Moses. Just as one person views art differently from another person.I see no duplicity between the two."

2773,"And with the possible exception of collecting, Australian licensing laws allow all of the above. I should know I have lived and shot over there. The idea of such laws is to remove weapons from those who have no good reason to own such things, and put extra safety restrictions on those who do.For the record, I do not actually agree with such stringent measures myself. But I don't think your argument really holds water. And to make such associations with tyranny is exagerated to say the least."
2774,"To expound on my last post:And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books. Funny how easy this book gets a pass. If we think it's Homer then for this book, that's good enough. But not so with the Bible. There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty, which in ancient texts, ambiguity is unavoidable.In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer. Therefore, we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author. This is undisputed.However, in regards to the Bible, skeptics overturn the use of Occam's Razor and require more than adequate proof of the Bible's claims. Even though the Bible is the most heavily documented writing of its day, still skeptics require more in order to believe the Gospels are actually true.Double standard much?"

2785,"And I'm saying all but 16 states had already had the law removed before the Loving case. Most of these were done via the legislature and very few had the law overturned by a court. In fact, only California comes to mind as a state that had the statue overturned by the courts instead of on repeal by the legislature. Who knew...but there is a wikipedia page on this: Anti-miscegenation laws - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaIt doesn't say whether or not it was via a court case or not but I know that California was a court case and Massachusetts and many Northern/mid-west state were via legislature action.Also, the Supreme Court case ruled the Virginia law unconstitutional not the Alabama law.

2790,"Yes, and since some might not, it should not be mentioned at all?Personally I only know a half dozen people who have had abortions (at least that I know if). 1 of them doesn't care, she has had 6 or 8 abortions...pretty much used them instead of the pill. 2 are pro life zealots now and feel terrible about the fact they had aboortions. 2 are pro life, but not zealots. The final one was overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion. Attended rallies and everything. SHE felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 months later she blew her head off. She could not get it out of her head that she had killed a baby. She became totally obsessed and finally cracked.So, yea...maybe it is not so out of line for people, including men, to say ""Think about it real hard because a lot of people regret it"". You don't have to get shot to know it hurts."

2793,"I believe he was talking about the two ends of the spectrum of opinions on abortion. With that in mind, ""minutes before birth"" would refer to those people in the far corner who think that abortions should be allowed even minutes before birth. Obviously, that idea is a little too radical for most people and from my knowledge, it's illegal right now anyway.Of course, this is just my interpretation, if you don't like it, then suck it up and wait for chaoticgnome to come back."
2794,"No, but I agree with him that we should all be able to find our own spirituality without the religious hound dogs tracking us down.  I don't think he would agree with how you and others approach the religious posts in this forum either.  Even though I don't agree with everything I read of him, which is not much, I do think he's on the right track. I hope he can find the answers he's looking for. Who knows, he may even be able to find a cure for stupid."
2795,"Actually, YES I HAVE! Not recently, but every time a cop has ever told me to sign a ticket he has made it clear that signing it isn't an admission of guilt, just an acknowledgment of receiving it. It is SOP for cops to say this with every ticket which requires a signature. And these cops said it to her also. She's either stupid or was looking for any lousy excuse to refuse to cooperate, and then justify her refusal to cooperate with them which is why the Court rejected her argument and threw out her case ala they upheld her conviction and nullified her attempt to unlawfully enrich herself over an issue which she caused herself. Only a knee jerk and emotionally bent liberal like you would defend a scavenger like her who will create any bogus issue possible to make an illegal buck from a fallacious claim."

2803,"That's HIGHLY debatable. (unless you meant fights (fites?) the evidence, then I would agree.)  Waxy"
2804,"Or that they tend to be better prepared, or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover. That's the trouble with these kind of stats, the interpretations are pretty open to debate."
2805,What is IIDB?
2806,"And so what? I don't think we rank (yet) along the lines of the Phillipines, Slovakia or Mexico. Does that mean we are supposed to be grateful as standards keep dropping further down? Besides, the latest Thomson Reuters Survey shows that 60% of Americans want a public option included in the healthcare reform legislation.That number, of course, doesn't include those who would scrap the legislation entirely as a better approach for achieving single payer. Since the public option in the current legislation appears so weak, at this point."
2807,"Now back to the thread. Excellent post Sarge.  I do take notice of how it could have started a conversation about how we could and should be talking about ways to lessen B on B crime, but instead we got some misdirection.  Crime factors from the FBI website  Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors. However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of their criminal predators. What do you say you work for changing these conditions instead."
2808,"But, now here's the thing, what about the peole with unwanted babies aren't good people. In my opinion, the vast majority unwanted babies aren't from good people.A good woman having an unwanted baby is a completely diffeent case, but, as I said, it doesn't often occur that a good woman has an unwanted baby."
2809,My apologies. The whole point: There is NO answer.
2810,"In principle, there is no difference between the two as the result is the same, a dead baby."
2811,"That is the point. They are not neighbors, there are in a relationship and would get married if they could. I know my partner and I would! But despite your fancy wording they did stop Gay Partner Benefits. Hundreds lost there healthcare, now those people will take their tax money and leave Va. most likely to go to Mass. where they can have healthcare. And those in Mass who disagree with gay marriage may move to Va. Again, soon we will be a divided nation."
2812,"Because specific species of horses only exist at certain periods in the geological record. Every so often, a new species that looks very, very similar, but with some distinct characteristics appears where the previous one use to in the geological record. Also, off the one of the coasts of either Ireland or England, there are sheer cliffs. In these cliffs you are able to see evolutionary development of shellfish for basically a billion years as you go from the top to the bottom. "
2813,"I know what you mean. I also wonder how they think their children or grandchildren will be paying for their medical bills.  Note, by way of comparison, this Pittsburgh local t.v. clip of the September 20th March for Jobs (part of Healthcare Justice Week, this week). See how clearly and intelligently the protesters articulate their objectives, and without the disgraceful display of blind malice we have otherwise witnessed from the teabaggers:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkUxvX5JNJg"
2814,"...which has since been rejected by scientists, doubted by most even from the start. Still don't see your point.  Christians used to think the earth was the center of the universe and punished anyone who said otherwise. Can I now discredit everything they say even though most (if not all) of them reject this?"
2815,The same can be said with a woman's reproductive rights as well. Your right to tell her what to do ends at her body.
2816,"I believe I said the military does not use sawed off shot guns, and then I said it does use other forms of shot guns.  You have never did explain why you as a gun owner defends every gun control law Sarah Brady wants!  There is a name for people like you and I believe it is traitor!"
2817,"nah, I was just poking fun because I can! Personally, this isn't a debate. It is a joke. I also think duo could be right that it is an evolution person."
2818,"Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful."
2819,"But what would be the minimum for you to survive? Here I am getting at the essence of self. For example, if you went into a coma with severe brain damage such that your body was alive but you had no mental processes left - no thoughts, emotions, sense of pain, no mental processes whatsoever apart from brain function controlling your body (heart rate, etc.) - would  you  have survived? Or would  you  essentially be gone at that point?"
2820,"On the contrary, anyone who takes an interest in such things is well placed to appreciate just how hard it is to grasp such distances."
2821,"ahhh, thats where youre mistaken. ANY aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance. the theory of electromagnetic radiation being wrong will be proof that God exists. the more we dont understand, the happier creationists are"
2822,"Well, certainly I don't expect to change the minds of millions of Americans, and that is not my goal. My goal is to convince readers of my writing that Americans SHOULD agree with same-sex marriage because it is morally correct to do so."
2823,And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it's all better. I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women.
2824,"Meanwhile there are school shootings happening in Germany no matter how much they tighten their overreaching gun control laws.  Think on that one before you speak again, blood shoes."
2825,"Well, JP rightfully pointed out that the percentage of rape victims becoming pregnant are VERY small, so it really doesn't carry much weight when trying to argue for the ""right"" to have an abortion"
2826,"I'm not sure how demonstrating that anti-abortion campaigners have managed to get laws enacted to claim full human rights for the feotus in other circumstances actually adds anything to a debate over whether it should have them. It's a simply an appeal to authority which is a logical fallacy. That's not to say that the feotus isn't fully human, just that that text does not prove it."
2827,"And God lives in Heaven, with Jesus sitting on the right side of Him."
2828,"Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory."
2829,"the guy may of been commiting a felony... by trying to rob this fello..  But this fello committed many more serious crimes.. by getting that kind of revenge..  I find the story very unplausable....  The gas station would have pictures...  The risk of damaging the car.. is just dumb.  The phone calls and threats would yield 20 years...  and posting on craigs list, leaves a trail...  And the FBI.. would certainly follow up.. and chase this would be good guy down and give him those 20 years.  its one thing to defend yourself... thats fine.  Its another to commit worse crimes than the bad guy you oppose.  im not impressed.  -Mosheh Thezion"
2830,"You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest: and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me. He isn't bearing witness to Himself here. Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing."
2831,Well at least in the US you can't. Also in the US if a law suit is brought it is normaly not about getting treatment it's about pain a suffering compensation. In the US if you bring a law suit there is virtualy no risk of having to pay the defendants legal fees if they win so there is no risk to the person or law firm in bringing a suit. This is why frivilous law suits are rampent in the US. Most insurance companies will settle a suit than take it to trial since it costs less to settle.
2832,"Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals."
2833,Uh-oh...  Pay no attention at all to the man behind the curtain!
2834,"Of course not. No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was. Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths. Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again. That is evolution. It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause. You see, no one has proposed another explanation that has stood up to examination. Majerus is trying to verify that the evolution really was the result of predation by birds. It seems a reasonable hypothesis but Majerus had several quibbles with Kettlewell's methodology even though he believes the hypothesis to be correct."
2835,A Nightmare because the Republicans have used the filibuster as a weapon to stop legislation. Over 300 pieces of legislation have yet to be voted on and nearly double that in the senate that have already passed the house...Yeah don't try to hide behind that smokescreen...
2836,You make the supposition that before the NRA got to a politician that he/she was in a state of purity before.  Q: How can you tell when a politican is telling a lie?  A: When their lips move.
2837,"And where does the 'Theory of Evolution' say that Man came from monkeys?That is a very inaccurate statement. Perhaps you do not accept evolution because of lack of information? What the theory of evolution states is that monkeys and apes came from a common ancestor, and that humans are apes from a taxonomy point of view.While there are 'gaps' in knowledge, I suspect if you did a study about what we actually do know about evolution, and human evolution in specific, you would be amazed at what we DO know."
2838,"First off, all equally arbitrary doesn't mean they are all valid. If I made a mistake let me clear that up now :)Secondly, you still have an arbitrary system going there. The idea that many people believe something doesn't make it true. Furthermore, your observations still make several assumptions that in fact are proclamations. Obviously people have come to observe different things from you...all of which can't be proven (in the sense we mean it) and all of which are abitrary."
2839,"And I have left them feedback to see what happens. I noticed this particular entry was sourced from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition so it is not something Dictionary.com wrote. I can see Iuris' point but the entry is still laid out wrong if this is the case. As written, ""Godlessness; immorality"", implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym. I think this is because some use the term ""godless"", an adjective, to mean immoral but ""godlessness"", a noun, to mean atheistic."
2840,"Now who's being disengenuous? When was the last time one of you gays posted a pro-Christian thread? lYou ONLY post anti-Christian threads, even though Christianity has been responsible for much of the good in the world."
2841,Good idea!
2842,"The number of deaths wouldnÂ´t be lower in any way. After all, countries like Rwanda and Sierra Leone donÂ´t have a working governmental strucure so couldnÂ´t enforce such a ban."
2843,Indeed there is no diffrence it is still a dead baby but throwing a baby in a trash can and leaving it for dead is far more cruel than abortion.
2844,"Doesn't that explain why manslaughter is like miscarriage, rather than why it is different?  And Clerisian, you didn't seem to be arguing that the two were distinct, rather you appeared to say that pro-lifers did support charging mothers who miscarried with manslaughter (where the mother's actions, say, drinking heavily, were the cause of death)."
2845,"It depends. Do you feel the same way about the Yeti? How about the Lock Ness monster? You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.' I think it is intellectual fence sitting myself. I feel the same way about God as i do about fairies, the yeti, alien abductions, and 'psychic powers'. There is no evidence that any of these exist, so based on the evidence, I don't believe they exist. Should new evidence be forthcoming, I will reevalutate my position based on that evidence."
2846,"Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function."
2847,So how are those gun free zones working out for you?
2848,How can CREATION be evidence of god if there is no evidence of CREATION? (If we are talking about CREATION meaning the mythical event describe in Genesis).  Smiley
2849,"Well, criminals are per definition those who break the law and the law is what you make of it. If private fire arms where illegal, those who would carry a firearm without proper license or permision would be considered criminals. Civil unrest, when turning into violence, is often something bad..."
2850,"So what?Most of them are still getting killed with guns. A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to ""win"" an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of ""reasoning"" has the following form:1. Topic A is under discussion.2. Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).3. Topic A is abandoned."
2851,"Actually it is. All the countries with public healthcare systems rank higher than the U.S. We are number 37. I thought we already went through this.  Every scarce resource is rationed in every system. For example healthcare is rationed for the uninsured, the uninsurable, the dropped ones."
2852,"and someone with good intentions would... stop them.  some planes can hold hundreds of passengers. the vast majority of them would want to STOP hijackings, not commit them."
2853,"Yes it is patent that you would assume that. Your wish to advertise this and tell the world, repeatedly must make you of some import.Repeatedly you make this a personal issue. I have addressed posts and say 'another poster has said ...such and such'. But you insist that I address YOU in such posts.Now you are going at it again, saying I'm not answering questions. This is an attempt to take the moral high-ground, and is itself highly deceitful, especially in light that you have in the past accused me of saying things that I didn't... see our discussions re: Archie, the transitional bird-beast.Also, you name-call, and then chuck a tantrum if anyone does the same back.I must say here that I do wish you'd stop personalising this, as it only leads to more confrontation, not discussion.Calling people names is just grand-standing. It is the sort of behaviour that suggests someone who is just interested in making themselves heard, regardless of anyone else."
2854,"#1 is above.The Jesus myth came out of Hellenistic Judaism already heavily imbued with the ideas of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53) and the son of God subject to a shameful death (Wisdom of Solomon “Let us condemn him with a shameful death”). Paul refers to the “archons”, the evil heavenly rulers of the age, as those who crucified Jesus (1 Cor 2:8) and extols the justice of the Romans (Ro. 13:1-3). The earliest layers of Q material do not refer to a death or resurrection (Kloppenborg). No earthly Jesus, no crucifixion, no death. It is all myth, man."
2855,"Actually I think it is defined by the creator who created all women :pBut in reality your opinion is gibberish. Equality is, like every other word, defined by the people who use the language. Currently it means ""the same"". People aren't equal because they are not all the same. Any attempt to argue otherwise is a display of gross stupidity."
2856,"THE STATE v. BUZZARD.Buzzard decided 2:1 to uphold a law restricting concealed carry. But had the question been is there an individual right o keep and bear arms for one's own protection, the court would have split 2:1 in favor of that right. So your mention of that case makes little sense if you are trying to make the point that Heller was not true to precedent. Heller was not about concealed carry, but rather the RKBA for self defenseOf the 3 judges, only Dickensen interpreted the RKBA as did the dissents in Heller. Dickensen read the RKBA as a limited individual right to keep and bear arms for the protection of the state (a right which does not encompass self defense)."
2857,"Iuris, there is something, I want to say something Zenlike in this statement--but I am not sure."
2858,"I would imagine that God would be very sad and depressed... because thats the way I feel when I see famine, war, dying children, people hating people for no good reason and the list goes on......  Maybe his guilt is so overwhelming this is what prevents him from showing up."
2859,Just going on what you have posted here ..  ..it looks like the first verse is decribing manslaughter - two men fighting - they bump into a pregnant woman - her baby dies...or does it?.  ..the second verse is describing murder.
2860,"Cannot be demostrated? What? The very fact that it is called the Theory of Evolution suggests that it is scientific by nature.   Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion. Religions are made up of people who believe in something and ask for no proof and ignore evidence to the contrary. Theories are made up of people who believe in something based on logic and much consideration with all evidence taken into account. Theories more closely resemble facts than they do religion IMO."
2861,I don't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so.
2862,"That is generally true. However, have you heard of a disease called AIDS? Some people are resistant to that disease. Guess what? They are reproducing more than those who aren't resistant."
2863,This isn't assumed in the studies. Nearly 35% of all arable land used worldwide is used to feed livestock.
2864,"Thanks!  There's a petrified forest in Mississippi also. I don't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces, but I'll find out next trip.  I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?  Likely, the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen. Other inert gases could have done the same."
2865,"A mind is what makes one a person. No mind, no person."
2866,"MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES  Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word Â“carryÂ”Â–a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English DictionaryÂ’s twenty-sixth definition of Â“carryÂ” is Â“bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.Â” 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. WebsterÂ’s defines Â“carryÂ” as Â“to move while supporting,Â” not just in a vehicle, but also Â“in oneÂ’s hands or arms.Â” WebsterÂ’s Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And BlackÂ’s Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase Â“carry arms or weaponsÂ” as  Â“To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.Â” BlackÂ’s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).  These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the Â“carrying of armsÂ” to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person Â“carries a weapon.Â” But to say that is not to deny that one may also Â“carry a weaponÂ” tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.  Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word Â“carriesÂ” in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of Â“carry,Â” a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column Â“carriesÂ” the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921."
2867,"okay... maybe he was a little pushy, but it made me wonder about this issue. I looked at some of the links presented by creationists; a book that attacks evolutionary biology by an electrical engineer, and a long rant about a false dichotomy established b"
2868,But faith is not religion. Religion is the expression of belief in a god or higher being or power of the supernatural.  As an agnositc I think that both theists and atheists are wrong since it is impossible to know for sure wheither a god exists or not while one is still alive.
2869,"Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.  And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for  walking in a mile in another's shoes . Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?"
2870,"And it still took an entire month for that whole division of well armed nazi soldiers to defeat a group of holdout jewish citizens, who were poorly armed compared to the nazis.  Yes they ultimately lost, but the ghetto residents were so hard to beat it took a month to flush them out. Even with all their tanks and superior arms, the nazis couldn't prove their superiority in short order."
2871,So now you're freely and willingly admitting that you'd take pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on innocent people who have never done anything to you?  Good God! No wonder you don't like guns and want to see everyone disarmed!
2872,"It's just the same flip flopping over and over. Depending on the argument,  science doesn't exclude the divine , {then switcharoo},  science proves there is no divine.  Just depends on the setting of the argument. (you do have your copy of Victor Stenger's book; God - The failed Hypothesis / how science shows that God does not exist, don't you?  Now you and five trolls will come pouring in here with needling and ad hominem attacks, to cover the weakness of your position. Your taunt of  XXXXXX  already got it started. I probably won't respond - it's funny and depressing at the same time."
2873,"So Starguy since you are obviously afraid of guns and won't go near, you don't have to worry about any""violent testosterone's"" but if you want to be friendlier  well you know how to do it. OUCH.emoticon_smile"
2874,"Oh yeah, sure, your rights have been violated by companies requiring you to work 40 hours a week! Would somebody be so good as to call the ACLU for Brady so he can get a lawsuit going which claims that having to work is a violation of his fundamental human rights and is unconstitutional?"
2875,"I don't like Romney at all...but...  What a bogus BS question to ask considering that Romney really can't do anything about it anyway. Romney can't arrest anyone, nor did he say he would."
2876,"You can do whatever you want to do with your money. The fact that you don't know any better than to do that with your money is telling, though. If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.  I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll blow them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you."
2877,So you agree that it's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals. Good we can agree on at least one thing.
2878,"Well, man has been called the third chimpanzee. Cladistics is some decades old now, and it has suplanted the old Linean system. While discoveries are still assigned genus and species names, evaluation of morphological charisteristics by computer yield much more realistic evolutionary trees."
2879,What I find hard to believe is that politicians will place their decision above the right to life of a human person only for political expediency.
2880,"No, I am telling you that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. That the courts loose interpretation of the Constitution in Roe v. Wade (claiming that the right to privacy includes the right to deny and kill prebirth children) has resulted in  the people  making laws and policies which are intended to counter the Supreme Courts reckless decision."
2881,"Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.  There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them."
2882,"And quote supposedly a former Justice who ignores the fact that one man = one vote. The NRA doesn't get to vote and just like guns, people vote and people kill people sans guns. Death by any firearms is far down the list! Attempting to move a fundamental right to the top of the list is ill advised and dangerous to a free people and the nation as a whole."
2883,Oh what a corageous maverick you are.

2886,"And what did I say?   I quoted the title of the video, said ""Enjoy"" and labeled the link ""link""  So how is saying ""enjoy"" and ""link"" which were MY words mockery? The only thing that suggests otherwise is the VIDEO's Title, which I did not create."
2887,"** I wasn't making a 'point', just an observation. But since you want a 'point', nip back over to ""The Swamp"",[that is, 'Internet Infidels (atheists)DB', and ask Oolon Colophid[sp.?] why he thinks the human appendix makes his 'point'."
2888,"Well, answering you seems to be a waste of time.  You ignore/reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand, and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before.

2893,The UK allow civil partnerships that provide the legal consequences of marriage.  That's enough isn't it?
2894,"Oh, I suspect my kid likes girls well enough, but most of them aren't any good at football so he finds them relatively useless (unless they are good at video games).Lots of kids were losing it early when i was young, too.

2895,"No one, I repeat no one wants to take punitive actions against any woman unless you call carrying the baby to term punitive action.........  All we want is for the baby in the womb to have the same chance you did if possible..........."
2896,"Yes. Were I a logical gay man, I would accept the fact that I cannot marry a man due to the definition of marriage. I would accept that fact and continue to demand that all legally joined couples share the same benefits now given to married couples."
2897,"What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842)."

2902,"Actually even with a concealed weapons permit, I do not believe you are allowed to possess a firearm on board an aircraft.The Second Amendment protects the right to OWN firearms and other weapons, and to use them in self defense. It does not grant a person the right to bring a gun on a plane, nor do I see how it could be interpreted to mean such a thing. Where do you get this question?And terrorists already recieve their weapons illegally. It is NOT LEGAL for any country to sell weapons to a terrorist country/nation/organization. But somehow they always get their hands on weapons. Hmm... I don't think they go out to their local shooting range and pick up a 9mm pistol. While it is possible (if they passed the backgroud check that is), its not probable. Because they would still have the illegal avenue to pursue the purchase of firearms with. If you want to ban firearms, the only thing you're doing is taking away the rights of citizens to defend themselves. Terrorists and criminals in general will find a way to obtain the firearms they desire no matter what laws are in effect. Llike they would follow the laws anyways? They ARE terrorists you know.)"
2903,You mean like the do with abiogenesis theories?
2904,"No, it was based upon the fact we hadn't seen one, yet there were fossils of them. Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed, that's how science works, when better data is found, the theories are changed."

2907,"No church has to marry any couple if they do not wish to do so.  I could head in to a Catholic or Lutheran church right now, and they have no obligation to marry me (a Wiccan - before that a Baptist) to anyone of the opposite sex (or same sex for that matter)."
2908,I dunno. Those Priuses are so small inside and out. How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it?
2909,"Well, evolution by natural selection makes things look as if they were designed for the environment in which they live. I don't presume to give God instructions on how he should go about His work. I only observe it."
2910,"We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term ""brain-dead""), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead"
2911,"But we certainly have the right to evict such persons.  But then, regardless, the embryo is not a person."

2914,"No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure."

I can well understand how someone can jog to the end of the block, but are they not, after all on the same street? What I can't understand is how someone can finish a marathon. It seems impossible that lots of little steps could carry anyone that far."
2917,"Don't insult Lee. He fought to protect his State's sovereignty. Slavery was not a major issue for him. He even led to the CS policy of enlisting blacks as condition for freedom.  I'm a Confederate reenactor, and it ###### me off when people don't respect the reasons we fought. It wasn't slavery. It wasn't racism."
2918,"What's your evidence that the Gospel prophecies are  spurious claims ? Seems like you've bought into a scalding case of rational tunnel-vision (or political correctness, if you prefer)."
2919,The same can be said with a woman's reproductive rights as well. Your right to tell her what to do ends at her body.
2920,So you're saying that it's better to just let the criminals stay armed and the good people should remain unarmed?  That's advocating to allow the wolf to kill as many sheep as it wants in hopes that it'll stop on its own and leave the rest alone.
2921,"Â“Scientists pick holes in Darwin moth theoryÂ” by Robert Matthews in the Sunday Telegraph (March, 1999)  I'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the debate, though. ID? EAM? YEC?"
2922,"According to history. I see you litterally ignored how it was wrong when one looks at how blacks were treated. How does it not? Blacks were paid less because they were black, Black soldiers weren't sent to fight because they were black. Black officers couldn't even command moderate level units. Black soldiers were treated as slaves when captured and often executed, not even afforded the rights of captured white northern soldiers. In fact it went so far as if a White officer in command of a black unit was captured, he was executed because he commanded a black unit. White officers captured from white units were treated as prisoners. White soldiers who didn't even speak english recruited off immigrantion ships from Europe were paid the normal amount. White soldiers were sent to fight, not sent to dig fortifications or ditches or latrines. Blacks were not treated equally in any way during the war, and reconstroction period in the north and the south shows a stark contrast in a belief of unequal creation. I suggest you go back and learn something about the war before talking about it."
2923,She had plenty of choice in the matter. She should have chosen to keep the kid. Even if she lost all her money because of this it would have been the right thing to do.
2924,So a mother can kill her handicapped child? That's going in the sig.
2925,But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.
2926,It's possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it's certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics.
2927,"So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about."
2928,"It could be argued that the delays in germanies advancement due to armed civil defenses gave the allies a chance to mobilize. IT is a case of ""what might have happened"", though, so it is impossible to tell for sure. With Hitler you had a unique situation which involved a tyrant and a lunatic in charge of a country, but with the popular support of the population.I would have to agree that resistance against Hitler didn't lead to any great victories. Of course, (and playing ""might have been again"") if more people had realised what kind of threat he actually posd, perhaps the resistance would have been more popular and successful.[QUOTE}The rest of your post I maybe reply to later, but it is always exhausting to write against any uncited and unproven claims...[/QUOTE]It is rather difficult to debate with PH, isn't it?

2931,That wouldn't be friendly.
2932,You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be
2933,Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. Hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has.

2934,"Where am I getting with this? The bill that would allow the Attorney General to deny a firearms purchase to anyone and everyone if their name is on the secret suspected terrorist watch list. The list with an unknown criteria for getting on, no disclosure so you know even if you are on it, and absolutely no way to get off of it.And what are these mayors saying? That a person who gets denied a firearms purchase -because their name is on this secret list and the AG has the power and authority to deny you said purchase- needs to be prosecuted as if they're a criminal."
2935,And that's your idea of disproff? Pitiful.

2939,"All I know is Obama and Biden both have a bad history of voting agains law abiding gun owners, if they are given a gun ban bill to sign, they will almost certainly sign it."
2940,"As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to  purpose.  And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase  survival of the fittest  without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time  survival of the fittest  has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."
2941,"My my, did someone get up on the wrong side of the bed or what, of course you realize that you just gave me the answer I was looking for, not that I didnt already know the answer, I just wanted you to say it. I dont believe I need a clue, so I will let you have it instead Brady."

2946,"Actually, the Miller-Urey experiment is basically so simple that with only a little training in the lab you could do it yourself. Please show that you are not a dupe and specify what you mean by ""organic matter"". The experiment was intended to show that in a reducing atmosphere with a source of energy, amino acids can form spontaneously. Several similar experiments have been done since that have shown that the formation of amino acids is almost certain. For example, they have been found in meteors.But that was a long time ago. More recent work has demonstrated the spontaneous formation of lipid membranes, reproducing molecules. The information is available to anyone who takes the time to educate himself."
2947,Because there are no dinosaur fossils above the iridium layer.
2948,"Sorry you feel like that. But in a fight to the death there are no rules of decent society.

When you sign up for that stun gun, buy then extra optional accessory of a partner with a 12-guage shotgun."
2949,"Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old."

2951,"No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.  This was not a legality issue, but an education issue."
2952,"Since you redacted my previous statement, I repeat it for your benefit: There is nothing racist about the truth. Notice the underlying message in your posted article is about the Court of Appeals throwing her LAWSUIT out. That was the underlying agenda which motivated this racist jerk who also happens to be black. It is common of these people today to refuse to obey the law, then blame the cops for not allowing them to act like they do. Remember that it was she who was speeding in a school zone, then to refuse to give up her keys made her a public safety threat. She deserved what she got even though the thought of a pregnant woman being tasered is scary to me, she could have avoided it by cooperating with the police. I'm not pregnant and I would cooperate to avoid it. This is why I think she had other motives which makes her the lowest of the low since she was carrying another life within her."
2953,A pregnancy.
2954,"That is true, but it is still a Nylon Bug is not a Nylon Horse... mutations can occur laterally [intra species] but not ascending [something entirely different]."

2956,"gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?"
2957,Yes he was a pacifist. He had no choice.  But he did want guns for Indian nationals.
2958,"Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified.

2959,"Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims.  PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful."
2960,"It's one of many viable paths, when combined with others, helps us to discover the workings of the physical universe.  Unless, I'm reading this wrong, and your statement means that the  debate  about evolution vs. creationism isn't a path for inquiry into the workings of the universe... In which case, I would suggest that debate is a healthy way to help us all crystallize what we believe, which in turn can lead to greater discovery, indirectly."
2961,"I think it's true. Why would someone make that up and pass it off as a real event?  I think the continents probably started separating some time after that, which is how God separated the people."
2962,"Oh, is THAT where you are getting your anti-evolution information: The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book dealing with biology that was written not by a biologist, but by an engineer...right? Walter James ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology.

I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful."
2963,That isn't the arguement your buddy made. He claimed guns could be controlled by dogs and snakes and stuff like that.  Do you have any examples of dogs or snakes controlling drugs and going on rampages and blowing folks heads off? Even claimed the dog was mournful for his bereaved master. He didn't mention how the snake felt  Also said something about robots and guns but didn't have any examples to wow us with. Do you?

Some Jews think pork is disgusting...would you support them banning you from eating pork? I'm not saying you can't think what you want about whatever you want (I personally think drinking blood and eating dead flesh is creepy but would never attempt to enjoin a christian from doing so)...but you cross the line when you attempt to deny someone liberty when it doesn't effect you."
2966,"It has nothing to do with  evolutionists  and  creationists . Some people are confused about relativity theory. According to relativity, the speed of light is constant, so a lightyear is a constant. The speed of light is unaffected by any changes in the observer's time frame caused by gravity or speed. Regardless of whether we sit in a black hole, a white hole, a bounded universe or an unbounded one, if light from a star has taken 10 billion years to reach us, then the universe is at least 10 billion years old."
2967,"But private citizens run background checks on other citizens all the time. I rent property. I make sure my tenants aren't felons before I lease anything. I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon. It is just something I personally would choose to do if I didn't know the buyer I was selling to..."
2968,"Actually, it can. The zygote doesn't always develop into an adult human being. In fact, about 60-70% of all zygotes never implants or gets rejected and end up being flushed down the toilet. And of those who do implant, some turn into blighted ovums or hydatidiform moles. So no, your claim is not as all-encompassing as you want to present it.  [quote]Conception/fertilization is the time in which this physical entity comes into existence. Prior to that time, this unique physical entity did not exist.[quote]  Which is also true after ANY cell division of any kind, and as such again is a rather meaningless point."
2969,"Its very sad to me that we have to brake the bondage of religion. I thought we did that? I was wrong. We under siege, from something horrible. One thing this horror is not, it’s not from God.Jesus could not follow fundamentalism, he couldn’t do it. Yet the monsters head rises again and so we must address the lies and twists this creature wants to chain us with. If we as nation are forced to obey this Dragon called fundamentalism; our children will be drinking blood and casting out demons from foreign lands all their lives.Nothing is more terrible or sinful than a Dogmatic man thinking he is doing the will of a God. Families have sacrificed (and are) their Children and drank the cool aid of the false Prophets. We have no choice anymore. We can not allow 2000 year old texts to be a literal book of guidance for a country our fathers fought to keep free. Don’t give up your fight, use logic and literary knowledge to tear down their straw houses. Use their book. Read it once and see what it says. The concepts in it actually destroy it. It’s failures in logic are easily shown as even laughable. Only then can man kind God. Secularism allows for such liberty. Church and Church states never will."
2970,"well, based on this argument, why shouldnt we kill mute, paralysed, vegetable, comatose, and very very drunk people, since they all cant think, or if they can they cant communicate that they are thinking. How about new-born babies that dont know anything? how about retarded children?you are fooling yourself if you think that women undergo abortions because they dont like that particular ""part of their body"". women undergo abortions because they dont want to raise the child when its born. until you face that truth, you'll be arguing under a dellusion"
2971,"But I didn't. I established the connection in my first answer the connection was primates. If I'd have said  Apes  then you'd have something to work with. You don't. He just assumed I was mixed up. And even when I answered him about what the connection is, he still just went on assuming this."
2972,"Well the government track record in health care isn't too good. Medicare is broke and busted by their own accounts. So if they can't run that correctly by what stretch of the imagination do you come up with them being able to manage the whole healthcare industry? Medicaid is broke. The VA healthcare system is a shambles. You would think they would get them up and running smoothly before trying to sell us the snake oil of their healthcare. Then there is the big problem of rationing. No matter what lies are told, health care is rationed in socialized medicine."

2975,"Well, I`ve always seen denmark to have a rather high level of political, economic, social and religous freedom (the only real detriment is high taxes, but some would argue that high taxes coupled with a large amount of income distribution actualy increases economic freedom, so its kind of ambigous).

That is not to say that only those people are the militia either!  Can you name one successful government that has ever won a guerrilla war? Russia fought in Afghanistan for how long before it limped back home?"
2978,"More like put on ""leave with pay"" aka ""taxpayer funded holiday"" while the woman is charged with ""assaulting a police officer"" to try and cover their misdeeds. At least that seems to be the usual tact in 21st century america."

Ricky Gervais has launched his second consecutive box office bomb as The Invention of Lying (Warner Bros) only mustered $2.2M or so to start the 3-day.

After a $57K per theatre average on 4 screens last weekend, the picture broke to a wider 962 locations with terrible results. The ?documentary? only sold an estimated $1.3M in tickets to start the weekend, and it will finish at about $3.9M for a PTA of less than $4,000.

2987,"Because a major portion of them are not as American educated and schooled in the Constitution and BOR. A quick streetwalk with Jay Leno proves that. I bet many do not even know who the sitting president is much less VP. Their concepts come from folks such as yourself who would deny rights up to the point of no return. Still you would say, ""boosh did it"".Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Where is Old Sarge? I haven't read a post from him here lately."
2988,Such personal attacks as yours indicate a bankruptcy of argument and reveal much about you while revealing nothing about me. If someone says that you are more likely to die in a car accident than in an airplane accident would accuse them of not caring about airplane accident victims? Would you accuse them of taking delight in the number of car deaths? 
2989,"So, if one person says that  Neo-darwinism  is dead, and many people say that it is quite well supported by the evidence and show said evidence, we are supposed to believe the one?  By the way, I notice that they failed to provide the context for the statement,  The 'modern synthesis' is dead.  Sound like a quote mine to you?  Oh, wait: are you saying that it is gaurenteed to be true because it contradicts the ToE?"
2990,Because....expansion occurs after heat is added. How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that.
2991,"This one certainly seems to be out of context, as reading a mere 2 verses farther yields the statement that ""[Menahem] did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.Are you then suggesting that what Menahem did was wrong? I would agree. And so, apparently, does God."
2992,"Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about."
2993,"Identity, or personality. A fetus doesn't have either. You need a mind to have either as well.  Anyways. This entire thread is just being redundant. All you have to do is read any of the other threads on the subject and you'll get your answers. Otherwise we're just repeating the same things over and over again."
2994,"Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened."
2995,"Iuris, there is something, I want to say something Zenlike in this statement--but I am not sure."
2996,"So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?"
2997,i think i like this answer because they said it offered an explanation. and you also have a choice to belive that explanation. becuase several.. not too smart people... developed other ideas of how this magnificent earth got here. oh and johnhanks i will never believe evolution. and that my opinion. and im not saying has to believe it i just wanted to know your take on this question.
2998,"Actually, there is no such thing as ""an evolutionary mutation of a gene."" A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists.

3010,"So? Isn't that exactly what we would want: people who conduct legal business instead of illegal business? That means less crime, even if organized crime is still into other things. Making a drug illicit effectively creates another market for organized crime.Look at alcohol and prohibition. Alcohol was a huge market for organized crime back in prohibition days. How many mobsters or gangs still have distilleries? They only people who operate illegal distilleries nowadays are indepedant brewers in rural areas. When you can get a wide variety of quality-controlled drugs at a licensed store down the road, no one wants to pay prohibition prices to get goods of uncertain purity or quality. Organized crime goes elsewhere to seek massive profits.I think marijuana is an easy case, its blatantly obvious that most of the harm done by pot on our society comes from associated crime: drug deals gone bad or turf wars, money put into organized crime's hands, otherwise law-abiding citizens put in jail or given criminal records. More dangerous and addictive drugs are a harder sell, I think.Drug education is broken. Often, drug education is distorted to over-emphasize the dangers of drugs, which mystifies the drug, often increases their allure and destroys confidence in the source of information because the information is obviously biased and incomplete. With or without legalization, I believe the best solution to drug abuse is preventative: quality information and education. Reduction of poverty would do a lot to curb drug abuse (and drug-related crime) as well.Also, marijuana use in the Netherlands actually went down after legalization, as did alcohol consumption post-prohibition in the US back in the 30's. I would have to hunt a bit around for references for those facts, though, but those facts show that you can't with certainty expect drug use to increase after legalization."
3011,"No, it doesn't. Our genotype (together with other epigenetic modifiers) gives us a much bigger brain than chimps, although it is structured very similarly.  On top of that, what we accomplish with our bigger brain is, as I've already demonstrated in other threads with reference to feral children, greatly dependent upon the accumulated wisdom imprinted upon the brain during infancy. We teach our children to problem-solve. We teach them language and abstract thought - we train the various parts of the brain to do their job properly. We aren't born 'complete'. Even as adults, not everyone is equally quick-witted, not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development.  Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree, sure, but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable."

Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) claimed ""the debate is over"" and global warming alarmists' predictions had carried the day.The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared, ""The world's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now. According to their forecasts, extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought, crop failure, famine, flood and mass extinctions.""On June 13, USA Today declared, ""The debate's over: Globe is Warming."" In support of its claim, the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups, some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources, and some politicians.Scientists DisagreeWhile each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage, leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations.Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service, sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim. ""Your editorial ... claim[s] the global warming debate is over. Not so,"" wrote Singer.Singer wrote, ""Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] says. And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F--not exactly a catastrophe.""Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media, ""Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically.""Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto (estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University--see http://www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm--at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries), climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change.""Sun Called Primary Cause""If we just look at the historical data, there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century,"" said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. ""The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate. This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences.""The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations, according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England's John Moore's University, is solar ray activity. ""Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world's leading space science journals. The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth's climate,"" Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post.Moreover, reports Peiser, Jan Veizer, one of Canada's top earth scientists, published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded, ""empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate, with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers.""Added Peiser, ""In fact, the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists. It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists, both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea.""Heartland Institute - ArticleAnd here's more:Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming – Caps Year of Vindication for SkepticsOctober 17, 2006October 17, 2006Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic. This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics. Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific “consensus” on climate alarmism.Claude Allegre, a former government official and an active member of France’s Socialist Party, wrote an editorial on September 21, 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” (For English Translation, click here: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming. See: http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune...asp?ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the “cause of climate change remains unknown” and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming, but to local land use and precipitation changes. Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice.“Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes,” Allegre wrote. He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money, noting that “the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!”Allegre, a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences, had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming. ""By burning fossil fuels, man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century,"" Allegre wrote 20 years ago. In addition, Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18, 1992 letter titled “World Scientists' Warning to Humanity” in which the scientists warned that global warming’s “potential risks are very great.” See: Warning to HumanityAllegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles, written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States.Allegre's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a “consensus” about manmade global warming. Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently. An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to “Holocaust deniers.” See: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition, former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as ""global warming deniers.""This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists’ computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics.60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming FearsEarlier this year, a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called “consensus” that the Earth faces a “climate emergency.” On April 6, 2006, 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists.“Observational evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future…Significant [scientific] advances have been made since the [Kyoto] protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary,” the 60 scientists wrote. See: Open Kyoto to debate“It was only 30 years ago that many of today's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe. But the science continued to evolve, and still does, even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas,” the 60 scientists concluded..: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works :: Press Room :.So in conclusion, as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions, so is the myth of Global Warming."

3015,"First of all, let's compare the ""B"" specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me. Secondly, shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish, but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented, Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years.One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938.Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years.The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years.Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured.Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: ""LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.""They go on to report: ""Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.""(30)Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears, differing very little in structure, showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it's existence. It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years. I think there's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us. This is true of virtually all fossils found, whether sharks or sand-dollars, they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species.Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians (the class of fish including the coelacanth), because they had bony elements in their fins, may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea, which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land.This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article: ""Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists: whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins. Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom, we never saw any of them walk, and it appears the fish is unable to do so.""(31)It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish, amphibians and reptiles do, but gives live birth. Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish, this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate. The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months, two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live, wriggling, little, sharks, some lizards give live birth, so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish, amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.The Fossil RecordHere's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth. Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed, they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish's evolutionary journey. They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish, but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer.Here is Hans Fricke's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo's story is based upon. And notice the last paragraph in the story. The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY'S THIS:I confess I'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins. Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. For every myth we dispelled, however, I'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made. In short, we have just begun to know the coelacanth.So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist, even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth, but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence, was a complete myth. Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution."

You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do."
3053,But it does go to show that addressing the reasons will do more than condemnation or criminalization. Not sure where you stand on those issues - but I am a strong proponent of doing more of this as a way to address abortion. All kinds of energy goes into the legalities. I think there are so many ways that both sides could work together.

See Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. . . . (dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the ""compelling state interest test,"" the Court's opinion will accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more confused than it found it.

3061,Though they have a couple of countys that say they will not inforce any new gun control laws which I find interesting. If the common people refuse to inforce their laws what good are those laws? They can make all the laws they want but if no one inforces them what can they do?

(SETI is an organization founded after scientists have discovered a strange signal from outer-space. From there on the organization has developed very much)  The signal, the SETI people got showed the first three prime numbers. This is very strange because it has never happened before (the scientist who detected the signal, called it WOW-signal, because it was so strange)  This signal shows a major part of Design: Specification  But unfortunately, to show that it is really true, it is missing another part: Complexity  The signal is evidence, but unfortunately it is too short. If those scientists would detect a signal that shows the prime numbers from 2 to 101 it would meet both parts: it has specification and complexity...  The SETI people would party all night...  So these  theories  aren't as unproven as you think they are...  (I still don't believe it happened like that)"

We do not know how it works. It doesn't even appear to work properly over large siatnces, the universe is expanding at the wrong rate according to our gravitational calculations, we invent dark matter and dark energy (neithe rof which has been detected) to explain gaping hole sin the theory and the entire theory is at odds with quantum theory. So why don't Kansas shcools teach about alternate theories in physics classes when covering gravity?The answer of course is simple: evolution is questioned to appease the religious fundamentalists that still hold your country to ransom by the balls. Don't give me this nonsense about ""evolutionist zealots"": they are simply scientists p***ed off with weak school boards cowering at the the first sign of the fundies getting upset over their kids being taught current scientific knowledge, rather than religious mythology, in science classes.

Are there bad parents / psychopaths / nuts in the USA? Yes.  Are hanguns legal in the USA? YES  Does the USA have shooting rampages more often then the UK?

In the end, the decision will be made based on the accuracy of the proposal, nothing else.Back in 1999 when they removed macro evolution from the curriculum requirements, they did so because their science advisory board, a board composed of college professors from our state colleges, including a couple of folks who are cinsidered some fo the top biologists in the world, told them unanimously that while macro evolution was the best theory we currently have, it may be wrong. Apparently while there is a huge amount of data and emprical evidence to support micro evolution, the same body of evidence does not necessarily prove macro evolution.Panion is simply a zealot on the other side of the issue from the YEC folks.

Do I wish the ruling had been different and the government should have paid for the abortion? Yes. But the court made the correct decision. It's the same with the Terri Schiavo case. All the conservatives wanted to save her because they thought the laws weren't right but the judges all sided on the side of the law. The law is written for a reason, and we don't get to decide when to ignore them just because of compassion. Then we fall down the slippery slope of abridging the first amendment because it's better, and violating other laws ""for the good of the people"". It's like ""Animal Farm"", where the laws kept changing ever so slightly, and soon it was no better than it was before. The laws were made, and if we want to change them, we should fight them, but court is not the place. Of course we all wish we could just go to the courts and get them to settle disputes like mommy but they are there to interpret the law, and unfortunately the law was very clear here, that in this case the government should not pay for the abortion."

Science is the investigation of natural phenomena through observation, theoretical explanation, and experimentation, or the knowledge produced by such investigation.How is it that you think that rocks that were once bones are not old.

3103,"Actually, there are three different definitions of biological evolution. Each of them is understood by biologists in its context without any need to elaborate. Each of these definitions are, of course, distinct and separate from other definitions of the word.For example, your definition #1 isn't one of those definitions. Even though you begin with a claim about honest definitions of biological evolution, your first definitions isn't one of them. It is, in fact, more like the Victorian definition of the word than what it has come to mean today, and certainly not relevant to any biological definition. Your definition #1 is the reason that Darwin objected when the term was applied to his theories. It isn't what Darwin had in mind and it isn't what a biologist or anyone who understands biology means, even today. Either you don't know what you are talking about (most likely) or you are trying to raise a straw man (dishonest).Of course, any fool can see that your definition #2 is circular. Stating that evolution is an evolutionary process doesn't actually define anything. While you object to embedding some undefined metaphysical postulate in a definition, you apparently don't have an objection to embedding the word itself in its own definition.Would you like to learn about the meanings that biologists assign to the word evolution?"

3113,"No, it doesn't. Our genotype (together with other epigenetic modifiers) gives us a much bigger brain than chimps, although it is structured very similarly.  On top of that, what we accomplish with our bigger brain is, as I've already demonstrated in other threads with reference to feral children, greatly dependent upon the accumulated wisdom imprinted upon the brain during infancy. We teach our children to problem-solve. We teach them language and abstract thought - we train the various parts of the brain to do their job properly. We aren't born 'complete'. Even as adults, not everyone is equally quick-witted, not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development.  Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree, sure, but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable."

Look at the examples of those who insist that there is a world-wide conspiracy in the scientific community to suppress the truth!  But I should say that this is on an individual basis. There have been creationists that, although they insist that they know the  truth', can maintain a pleasant and interesting conversation.  And, sadly, Close_slave_can is also right in that there are too many people on the evolution side who are a little too quick to attack creationists when they start to argue. This is understandable, of course, since many creationists are repeating the same bad arguments that we have all heard a bazillion times, and we have just recently had an example of someone who would not listen to reason since  all scientists are biased and cover up contrary evidence  -- it is very easy to stereotype anyone who comes along and states something that sounds pro-creation.

The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all. If you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god... well go ahead... but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you.

3139,"My stance on morality is based on the following observations:1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along.2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer.3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others.Those are observations, not proclamations.The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily. I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many, if not most people, at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted. It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering.What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made?Either way, are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid? In your scenario, someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation ""black people should be slaves to white people"" and build a morality based on that. My moral approach questions that proclamation as well and thus avoids un-necessary human suffering."

While ""creationism"" is a belief in mythology based on no evidence, no one ""believes"" in evolution. Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution."

3161,"Plenty of problems with that ""study"" and parts of it are just hilarious.Number one, socialization plays a huge role in an individual's reaction to handling weapons. A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible, constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty.I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the ""gun"" with a football. Putting a dozen or so 18-22 y.o. in a room with nothing but a football would ensure that an athletic pecking order would be established very quickly. Domineering males would be throwing the football around in a competitive, even punishing fashion, submissive males would be cowering, hoping nobody throws the ball to them. Elevated testosterone levels would be expected in both; some from competition and some from fight / flight. . .Both groups would exhibit the ""aggressive"" behavior the study offers for diametrically opposite reasons. This effect is compounded because of the anonymity; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge, . . . especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant. I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the ""aggressive"" domineering subjects.I actually laughed out loud when the overly concerned testers believed they needed to defuse the potentially deadly aggression they caused in the test subjects:""Because of the potentially arousing nature of the experiment, we wanted to ensure that all subjects were reasonably calm when they left the lab. Therefore, all subjects next watched a relaxing video of nature scenes and classical musical. Given that subjects had been deceived, we next debriefed them, emphasizing that they should not feel badly about any aggressive behavior they exhibited.""Jezz, thanks for saving us all from wanton pellet gun caused hot sauce attacks!"

3171,"Halton Arp is far from suppressed.  Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.  And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.  I'd say that if he is  suppressed  then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his  fireworks  universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this.  But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these  weird  redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away. The ones that can't are just curiosities. Then there isn't a systematic way to look for these things, so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching, which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time."
3172,"It is not speculation. When the 2nd Amendment was written, modern military weapons were flint lock rifles.

The answer to that 'condundrum' has been known since the 19th century, and creationists don't get it yet.  From  Polystrate  Tree Fossils  Since the answer was shown to be answered in 1868, it shows that effort to use that 'conundrum'' is rather dishonest and ignorant."

In fact, the verse our Creationist conveniently left out says the the Earth has edges ... this is probably more flat earth mentality, like the four-cornered earth mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.

3191,"Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.  If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it."

3194,"This is the argument concerning 'choice' that, to me, rings untrue and is a potential weak point. The whole 'when does life begin/when is it human?' isn't where those that favor woman's rights should stake their claim. I support a woman's right to control her body and I feel that one of the best ways to 'judge' a culture is to see how they treat women. I think that it is imperative to allow a women to control her body, regardless of when life begins, etc... Now I also abhor abortions and I extol responsibility. However, #$%( happens and a woman MUST be able to retain the ability to decide what to do in the event of an unexpected pregnancy. Now, considering responsibility important, I can understand and appreciate time limits and whatnot, because that is humane. But we should call a spade a spade... a fetus is or will be human and an abortion does 'kill' it. Its horrible that it happens, but we have to allow women that right."

Williams says the woman placed the baby in a plastic biohazard bag and threw it out.You don't see placing a live new born baby in a bio hazard bag and throwing it into a trash receptacle as medical staff stood by and watched as shocking and disgraceful?

And what's so funny about it is I'm sure none of these articles make mention of this being a huge controversy and how it gives ammunition to creationsits: they just play like dissent doesn't exist.  How does protein last 68 million years? Anyone who believes this is out of their mind.

3202,"nobody said that incest was the same as homosexuality. however, Im sure you would agree that people in incestuous relationships are being socially pressure similar to the gay community a few years ago. so think about it, an incestuous couple cannot legally get married or benefit from any of the rights that homosexuals are protesting for. yet, like gays, their position is that they are consenting adults that are not hurting anyone by their actions. the sanctioning of gay marriages will very likely open the doors for incest marriage. bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments, since their logic is about the same (i.e., not illegal, not hurting anyone else), and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future.  while nobody equated homosexuality to incest, there are grounds of commonality between the 2, and thats what the discussion was about. I hope you see that"
3203,"A fact is simply a phenomenon that is observable by any competent observer. It is not proven.For example, Euclid made the assumption that one and only one straight line exists between two points. This is generally considered a fact. However, two points that cannot be connected by a straight line could be discovered tomorrow, and that Euclid's first postulate would be disproven."
3204,"Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings."

3209,"So the fact that there are fewer crimes in britain is evidence, but the fact that there is a great deal more crime in S Africa, despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world, is not?  In new york, the reduction in crime was the result of an overhaul of police and the criminal justice system. Couple pages on that:  http://www.city-journal.org/html/15_1_ny_crime.html  http://www.ny.gov/governor/patrecord/crime.html  New York started instituting prohibitive firearms laws in the 60s. Most of the firearms laws they  enjoy  now were put in place in the 70s (except for a brief round of idiocy in the 90's having to do with semi-auto rifles.... assault weapons , which they banned despite the fact that the police commissioner of NY City testified that they had no record of one ever being used in a crime).  So, they had prohibitive gun control for 30+ years, and then when they spent billions on theri criminal justice system and police, none of which had anything to do with gun control, their crime rate started to fall, and somehow you want us to believe that this was due to the gun control? Nobody here is that gullible."
3210,Human rights?  Is a human fetus (a human child in the fetal stage of their life) not a human life?  Do I even need to bother with linking to a dictionary on this one anymore?  Just one word;  Hypocrisy 
3211,"Partly because it is entirely dependent on one particular human being for its survival, after birth the baby can be looked after by pretty much anyone, before it is entirely reliant on one person, if that person dies, the feotus dies. I place value on the life of the feotus because it is close to human, it has the potential to become human. The closer any being is to being human the more value I tend to place on its life. I value monkeys more than I value cows, for example, I value cows more than I value mice, or rats. I would only kill cows for food, not for sport or because they were irritating. Mice I would kill or have killed if there was an infestation and I couldn't get rid of them any other way, insects I'm not too bothered about swatting if they annoy me. The feotus I consider to be close to human, closer than any other species and, whilst I consider it wrong to kill it, I can understand why others don't and recognise that banning abortion also results in suffering and loss of life. It's a difficult decision for me whether the loss of feotuses is balanced by the suffering prevented, lives saved and freedom promoted by keeping it legal."

3214,"Well, it stated that they would not be forced to have an abortion, but would be held in contempt of court.Was what he said wrong only because he is trying to intrude on their private lives, or because he felt that the couple should not have any more children put onto the taxpayer's backs? Is this necessarily a liberal view?"
3215,"No, the logical explanation was already worked out by scientists several decades ago.  RNA was theorized to be able to perform both informational and catalytic ability, thus serving the biological roles of both DNA (information storage) and proteins (biocatalysts). The theory was confirmed, I believe in the early 1980s, when ribozymes - catalytic RNAs - were disovered. And since then, scientists have been able to evolve in the lab a ribozyme that is capable of copying part of its own sequence. They are getting close to confirming the theory that an RNA molecule can serve as the information store and the catalytic machinery for its own replication."
3216,"Gun does exactly what it is supposed to do when you pull the trigger, it goes bang and a 9 year old is shot.  Breaks 3 of 4 rules of firearm saftey, yet it is not his fault:  http://capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2784  1. All guns are always loaded.  2. Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy.  3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target.  4.

3219,"I think that while may be correct, it sounds too elitist to be accurate. Sane people don't create imaginary friends to explain things. Most tribal religions are very matter of fact. While exotic or fantastic they are very material (lots of talking animals), and also meant to be entertaining. They also incorporate superstitions, which often hold a few survival tips.Also ""primitive"" religions revolve around hallucinations, via shamanism and drug use. I think no body asked why; they just got stoned and after they sobered up the human intellect kicks in an tries to reason if what happened was real then it must be some link to the supernatural. I know Judeo-Christian religions are anti drug use in most places, but in ancient times drugs was a very integral part of religion.I have a soft spot in my heart for that ""Jesus Raved"" T-shirt."

If at the upper end of that range that puts it very close to the age of Archaeopteryx (140 to 170 my).  But contrary to what creationists like to claim, this isn't a problem. There is no claim that Archaeopteryx is ancestral to Confuciusornis. If you look at birds now you will see lots of different species. They have a common ancestor but are not descended from one another. Archaeopteryx is just the oldest example of a bird that we have, and considering the distance between the sites where the fossils were found, and possibly several million years in time, I would expect them to be different."

While an abortion (like any medical proceedure) carries risks, these are far smaller than those posed by a woman who sees a pregnancy to term and gives birth.In case you forgot, here are the figures I quoted you before:http://www.acog.org/from_home/public...v103n4p729.pdfWhich shows an abortion will cause 0.3 deaths per 100,000 carried out in the USA in 1995.http://www.childinfo.org/eddb/mat_mortal/Which shows a term pregnancy poses a 1 in 4085 risk of death over a womans lifetime in industrialised nations in 1995.You do the math- how many abortions does a woman need to have before she is as at much risk as that posed by taking pregnacies to term over her lifetime? Something like 80, which gives a good indication of the relative risk......"
3226,"It comes down to two groups  1 religious groups that believe that their religious freedom is more important then gay peoples religious freedom, that their religious freedom is more important then the safety and protection of gay families. That their religious beliefs and freedom is more important then gay equality and civil rights.  2 Heteros that believe that gay people are sick, diseased, less then human, and that their family structure is the only one that should exist.  In both cases groups that have a sense that they are privleged and their privlege is more important then the rights and lives of gay people."
3227,"Halton Arp is far from suppressed.  Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.  And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.  I'd say that if he is  suppressed  then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his  fireworks  universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this.  But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these  weird  redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away. The ones that can't are just curiosities. Then there isn't a systematic way to look for these things, so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching, which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time."

3229,"Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile."
3230,"There was nothing wrong with my answer. I did the correction after being insulted, double-standard huh. I am not entitled to my own opinion if it doesn't agree with yours. I expected alot more from you, you've let me down. Your obviously only looking at one side of the argument. emoticonXWow"
3231,"The response has to be proportionate to the threat. The Eighth Amendment specifically forbids excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishment; your proposal that all guns be regulated in a manner best fitting machine guns qualifies as both excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishment.  You're really setting yourself up to fail with this argument of yours. Your suggesting that more guns be regulated like machine guns and destructive devices, is like coming out and claiming that the smallest of handguns, is as dangerous and deadly and destructive in power as a belt-fed, fully automatic, .50 caliber machine gun.  When you argue this you're revealing what we already know about you; you hate all guns, and you don't want anybody to own a gun, ever."
3232,"Well, the funny thing is... if he's so public about his plans and even if he succeeds a little, the SEC will probably come in and bankrupt he and his flock and ruin the rest of their lives. He probably would end up facing a fair amount of jail time. Stock manipulation is illegal. And a giant like Microsoft will be out for blood. His being so vocal about it is probably the dumbest thing he could do. This guy is not playing with a very bright bulb.  And, yes, you'd think that he'd be pouring all his energy into feeding the poor, helping New Orleans recover from Hurricane George. Some of these christian folk have their priorities so twisted it makes me sick."
3233,"Hi Joe, welcome to the forum. I must warn you though that you have argued so perfectly and similarly all of the points I just argued on another thread about abortion, that some people around here might just accuse you of being me with a new handle. No problem though, I hope you have better luck than I did."
3234,"Why should your belief of that being the case take precedent over the belief that that is not the case?  What gives you (or any group) the right to impose your views on other people, directly affecting their rights, simply for an idea you have of  ideals  that not eveybody agrees with?"

3237,That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.
3238,"Burglars in Albany netted 12 guns from three break ins during the past week.  That recent proliferation of stolen guns led the Albany Police Department to issue a plea Thursday for gun owners to lock their guns in a safe place, preferably in a heavy-duty, secured gun cabinet, police Lt. James Williams said.  Burglars seem to know which homes have guns and are targeting them, Williams said. That is a major problem.  Straight forward enough you'd think but then as Paul harvey used to say, page 2.  Dozens of readers have taken issue with The Journal News over its decision to run a list of pistol permit holders in Westchester and Rockland counties as part of a wider investigative article.  The names of more than 30,000 licensed handgun owners were posted online as part of ?Falling Through the Cracks,? the paper?s Dec. 10 report that found that thousands of registered handguns were unaccounted for because there is no system to secure the weapons of permit holders who die.  Well duh!"

3240,"No, I wasn't looking for religious morality, I was looking for general morality, so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate. Anyway, what is with people thinking that an activity that creates children is neccesarily a good thing? There are already a lot of people in the world, and too many more will end up using up all the food, and then there will no people, because we will all die an agonizing death of starvation. Heterosexuality is good, without any reproduction we would die out as well, but homosexuality is also very good and important because without enough non reproductive couples, the population would increase even more."
3241,"For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad.  If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together."
3242,"So, had I used the lock, that crime would not have occurred, therefore the lock would have deterred the crime."
3243,"I think you need to look up euthanasia, and not only for the correct grammar. Those examples are not euthanasia. Abortion is not the same thing as euthanasia.Why don't you just say what is on your mind, rather than setting these ham-handed traps you hope someone will fall into? It is clear what your opinion is. If you have something to say, by all means express yourself."
3244,"And well he should have ignored it. Your analogy is nonsense.  Can you state that in English? What does that mean?  What does a mutation have to do with a heart transplant? What are you smoking?  Certainly not. Why would you make such a remark? While a mutation that allowed a bacteria to metabolize nylon waste products is most certainly an example of evolution, heart transplants (artificial or otherwise) aren't. It is an ignorant assertion to claim that they are.  Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? Much less can science offer  proof  of evolution by means of organ transplants. The idea is simple minded at best.  since it seems to be important to you, why don't you offer  proof  that evolution doen't happen. Other creationists have already admitted that it does in this thread."
3245,"That's the rub: people worshipping the bible as opposed to their god. Fortunately, many people can cope with science being how their god did it."
3246,Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.
3247,"Yeah, I don't know why he is lying. I suspect because he wants to get elected and can't win Tn without saying he is pro-life. He has voted against the pro-life position 87% of the time while in washington.  Someone in the media should ask him why he is lying."
3248,You know I'm not saying that.  Is there no alley you'd avoid given the chance?  Was she looking for trouble?  Police would certainly want to know what she was doing there.

3250,"Actually, you are living in the past. That DNA changes is neither an assumption nor a prediction. It is an observation."
3251,"Yes, because atheists love it when New Orleans gets drowned in water and thousands die.

Maybe a couple of beers, some dogs on the grill, all topped off with us ******* on a crucifex.  Grow up."
3252,Nah I'm not debating this. I'm trying to show that this debate doesn't really prove anything. But I'm sure you can get the names of those who are willing to debate this and look them up in the future if you ever want an easy debate victory
3253,"You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?  I don't follow you here. Can you back up your little sacred  trust  theory? There is no trust between an embryo and a woman. An embryo cannot feel trust, it cannot even feel itself. Its really only a hunk of cells, and saying that it trusts the woman is like me saying that the flowers in my garden trust me to water them. And, at what point does a life become  sacred . I'm sure you've weeded your garden, is that an embarrasing disregard for sacred life? Is hunting an embarrassing disregard for sacred life? By your logic, i can call almost anything a  sacred life ."
3254,"Because she, like every other political figurehead, thinks it's alright for her to carry a gun, but not anybody else.  If she DIDN'T support a ban on all firearms, then why did she say  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them -- Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in -- I would have done it.   That doesn't mean anything."
3255,"Archangel fails to understand the basis of Animism (as usual).  Animism seeks to explain things it cannot by assigning them supernatural associations. Often that is done through a soul. The principle argument I've argued in their similarities is that of why they do such a thing. What cannot be explained now or its relation to the greater whole is credited to a supernatural being, a being or set of beings that exists not entirely of the natural world. Where ancient animists believed that lightning was associated with the Gods, and that Volcanoes were the manifestation of Pele, the principle is the same. What cannot be explained or understood now is of a higher being. How did this rock get here? Where did deer come from? How do they exist in the larger picture? Animists assign souls, or anima to the inanimate and animate objects as a way to place what they do not understand into a coherent organized picture.  Intelligent design is no different. Only that it has replaced lightning, volcanoes and rain with the human eye and origin of the life. While it may not use the same identical concepts of anima to inanimate object, the core logic is identical.  What is too complex to understand or explain now is of a higher being."
3256,There could be a point in the future that a foetus can be taken from the womb at any time and taken up to term in a laboratory.
3257,"Actually, they do. They just don't want it to leak out. But it's too late. The cat is out of the bag.

From there came William Burt in 1829 with the same idea to make a system of moving keys to be printed on paper; his as well was unsuccessful.

3267,"An abortion is an abortion. Your emotional use of the word  euthanasia  is pointless and irrelevant. Either you object to abortion or you don't. Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash.  I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion).  Don't like it? ... TOUGH!  And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself."
3268,So you have said.
3269,"Right. That certainly explains the many, many versions of Christianity."
3270,Just wondering if you are going to respond to the OP (as it was addressed to you to help you to understand something).  If you ask me I'd just ignore the negative comments that some posters make toward you. Just focus onexplanations of misunderstandings and constructive criticism.
3271,"I understand that the position is commonly called  Pro-life.  However, pro-life should not just concern abortion. Pro-life should be about safe sex, peace, stem cell research, exercise, healthy eating and pollution control. As of yet, I've never seen a Pro-life rally against obesity -- which kills more than any abortion clinic. It truly is  Anti-Abortion  and some can argue that it is  Anti-Choice.  The reason it's not call anti-anything is because the prefix  anti  implies a negative, and all of our connotations make it a bad thing. No one wants to be anti-choice.  And seriously, other than people who directly profit from it, who is  pro-death?   As for the original post, it seems that story is more about some African women not knowing how to deliver babies, or prevent them."
3272,"But in the context of Debater’s usual arguments on this board, one might presume that he is trying to imply that somehow a “side” that he favors is not being given a fair hearing. It seems to be an echo of the oft expressed creationist cry that it is only fair that if a scientific theory that they oppose on religious grounds is presented in science class, i.e., evolution, then their side should also be presented on a equal basis with science.I thought it might be of some interest to understand Jefferson’s motivations behind the above quote.After Jefferson left office and retired to Monticello he continued to do business with a bookseller in Philadelphia named N. G. Dufief. Apparently on some occasions, Jefferson would purchase books that were sent directly to him at Monticello and Mr. Dufief would act as Jefferson’s agent for payment. Jefferson would then, from time to time, settle accounts with Mr. Dufief.That seems to have been the case with a book by M. de Becourt entitled, Sur la Création du Monde, un Systême d'Organisation Primitive. Jefferson had seen notice of the book’s publication and presumed it to be “…either a geological or astronomical work.” He ordered it to be sent to him upon publication with instructions that Mr. Dufief be contacted for payment. Thus, Mr. Dufief became involved with a book that he had never seen. Mr. Dufief extended credit to Mr. Jefferson, as was his custom, and paid for the book.But such little technicalities never stopped the forces of good in the community. From the title alone criminal charges were brought against Mr. Dufief for crimes against religion. I do not know to outcome of the case but presume that Mr. Dufief was acquitted. The quote that Debater got almost correct is from a letter that Jefferson wrote to Dufief about the matter. At the end of the letter Jefferson discusses settling accounts by adding the unknown price of Newton’s Principia to his balance of $4.93 and sending it along to Philadelphia.Here are Jefferson’s comments on the case of Mr. Dufief from a letter of April 19, 1814."
3273,"This is where natural selection occurs: people who can better survive diseases survive more (obviously, I hope). Also, until recently, the average life expectancy was getting higher. At the time of the pharoahs, 30-40 years was normal. How is 70 or more less than 40?"
3274,"I believe the earliest gospel estimation is placed around 50 ad, which is almost 30 years after Jesus died."
3275,how is it discrimination when they aren't being denied rights everyone else has? They have no right that I don't have. Read my previous posts before you respond.Also affirmative action is helping those that are disadvantaged to do the same things that those that aren't disadvantaged like the American wiht Disabilites act. It's not asking to give them different rights.
3276,"** But here you blow it. No system, as a whole, is subservient, subordinate, inferior, or secondary to any or all of its parts. By simple definition a whole system is greater than, and superior to, any and all of its constituent parts."
3277,My bet is that it won't be natural selection.
3278,"As of this post, Project Steve stands at 703 Steves. The Steve-o-Meter's visual representation is a little misleading."
3279,"But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government."
3280,"The NT was compiled in the late 4th Century AD, being criticised at the time for the overtly political choice of which texts were included as Canon and which were rejected to become the Apocrypha. Further it is now generally accepted that the text was altered at a later date to comply with OT prophesy. Like The Saxon Chronicles, King Arthur or Robin Hood there is too much romanticisation and mythologising to be certain of virtually anything in the text."
3281,Actually true. But I fail to understand the point. mtDNA from Neandertals seems to indicate that they are not ancestral and did not interbreed with modern humans. Neither are mammoths ancestral to modern elephants. In both cases the evidence indicates that they are related species. What was your point?
3282,"Here is the way evolutionistic  science  works:  There is fossil  A  --->fact  There is fossil  B  --->fact  Evo  science  comes in:  since  A  is similar to  B --->fact  therefore evolution is proven!  It is so easy, so simple, so evident is not it?  Go ahead write articles, make movies, indoctrinate noncritical  minds, do the mighty NLP:  evolution is a fact   evolution is a fact   Go around chanting, dumb down pupils.  Do not criticise the Miller/Urey  proof . Spread the good news:   building blocks of 'life'  were  created in laboratory."

3286,"And, are ""birth"" parents obligated to the welfare of a zygote, an embryo, a fetus, do the zygotes, embryos, fetuses own ""birth"" parents?"
3287,"No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things."
3288,"Uh, my point was that gun control has become a different issue since the 1700s, not that it was suddenly a new point.  Grizzly, you say that gun control is 'always the first to go'. Godwin's law aside, what do you think of the Patriot Act and Gitmo? Do they not count as rights being eroded, to you? Or is it simply that you consider your right to bear arms more important that your right to privacy or your right to freedom from imprisonment without trial?"
3289,"yup, those damn libruls harping on about equal rights and other rubbish. Lets force our morality on them, quick!"
3290,"Hey, I said let's just ignore the fundemental problems. If the flood did happen what should we see?"
3291,And I maintain that your belief is dangerous to America and people like you should be deported to less civilized countries so you can truly appreciate what you had.
3292,"And I believe they should ban religious speech the defame gays or ban religion all together as a public nuisance and protect the public from its drug like effects. I understand, however, that to restrict others freedom of speech of one group today, might mean that my freedom of speech could be restricted tomorrow.  They have the right to free speech even free speech, I or anyone else diagrees with. This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech. With freedom comes responsiblity. The law suit for pain and suffering, I think is just.  Oh so many law suits to plan. Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity. This case now sets Precedent, that if I find religious speech hurtfull, or the actions of religious groups trying to fight gay people, marriage, or gay rights, I could sue for pain and suffering.  God bless Fred Phelps for giving fundies and religion a black eye. Fred Phelps is the one of the best things ever that could happen for gay rights. GO FRED."
3293,they may respect life but what about respecting the quality of life?if they cared about their children's future they would not breed like rabbits. It is callous to use their children to win the 'numbers game'quality before quantity.I don't deny that abortion is murder in the womb though.
3294,"Well, there's a little more to it since the courts ruled that abortions have to be carried out in the first trimester when the fetus is much less developed than one that could survive outside the womb (or ""room"" if you prefer)."
3295,"The idea of god having a plan for anyone is contradictive to the idea of free will. Either it is all in what he has planned or it is what he gave you the right to choose. And to go slightly off topic but not really, if gaof had a plan for everyone and only what is in the plan is what happens then it must be in his plan that I am gay."
3296,"Oh dear. We once again see the fallacious 'information' argument being used. The craters on the moon give us information about past impacts, do we demand that information has a 'sender'? Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars, do we demand that information has a 'sender'?  And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information' has a sender and recipient, genetic material has...neither. It's just chemicals and forces. Nothing more. There is no identifiable 'sender', and there is no identifiable 'recipient'. Sure, you can chuck a god in here or there if you like, but that's not where the evidence leads. DNA is not a code, DNA is certainly not a 'language', and it only falls under the definition of 'information' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does.  This is pretty much meaningless without elaboration.  Meaningless analogy as you are talking about deterministic chemical reactions, not the equivalent of  1000 books  whatever that is supposed to suggest - for example, in the context of chemistry, how do you know that a reaction  equivalent to copying 1000 books  is difficult or uncommon?  Well, no, as evolution is not a random process, but then you wouldn't know that would you?"
3297,Because electricity moves faster than a man's arm? Give me one example of this actually happening and I'll concede that it's not a ridiculous thing to consider.
3298,"I believe the question was  who?   I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.  The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.  Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now."
3299,"?? What are you trying to say?  Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other  truth  out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient."
3300,Do you think this resistance got their most useful weapons out of a normal store? Please don't try such arguments without knowing about European history.
3301,"I'm always honest! It would become a completely atheist planet in no time - what makes the earth different is Christ's teaching and actions while he was here, and the following ACTS of those who witnessed it. His Disciples (mainly Peter) were scared little rabbits while he was alive, and after his resurection, weren't afraid of anything. That historical fact and other similar ones have had quite an impact for Christianity. The debate about whether God exists or not isn't only about the origin/science debates."
3302,"Not a good week on the hominid front for Darwinists. First the homo habilis thing, now this (from your link):  ?This feature implies some level of Neanderthal ancestry in this otherwise modern human fossil,? the authors explain  Of course, this is not surprising since Neanderthal DNA is 99.9% the same as ours:  http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com...s.php?id=82519  Human/Neanderthal DNA 99.9% identical  Of course the problem here, is there is not enough time to go from Neanderthal morphology to  modern  morphology by way of RMNS. This is why science needs the Neanderthals be a different species and to go extinct, leaving no trace behind. But if modern humans descended from Neanderthals, darwinists will have to admit that the transformation happened nearly instantly."
3303,"Well, which came first, the ice age or the stone age?  Also, if the impact theory is true, then the world would have heated up for so many number of years before it could have cooled down. The asteroid would have been a global killer or something very close to one."
3304,"But psychologically speaking, a first trimester fetus is not a being since it lacks sentience. DNA is all it takes to confirm that something is human; like your fingernail pairings."
3305,"Not if you have permission to do one from the buyer. If I sold a firearm, and didn't know the person so well, I would do one. I have contacts in businesses who can do them for me for free. Its just a smart thing to do. Should it be the law? No way. But I would do it. Better safe than sorry in this instance."
3306,"Perhaps, but as studies have noted, contributing the growing of livestock is one of top things one can do to harm the environment.""The livestock sector is a major player [in climate change], responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2 equivalent. This is a higher share than transport.""I've read that methane and nitrous oxide have greater warming potential than Co2.Furthermore, IF the government were to become involved and create an objective to reduce meat consumption in a country I'm sure the people would be aware as to why and make their choices. Living green is already a popular topic so many people who are not already aware of efficient energy use would eventually learn if this issue came to a front."
3307,"I think I understand this.  The goal is clear, check.  Self-restraint is good, check.  But I do not see what this has to do with the OP. Could you explain, please?  Who are you recommending should use self-restraint?  The protestors?  Or are you saying, self-restraint is your recommendation for birth control?"

3310,"The 1995 book, Sex in America, by Gina Kolata, Edward Laumann, and Robert T Michael, which summarizes the results of the last comprehensive nationwide sex survey in this country, reveals that as many as a fifth of the women surveyed practiced anal sex. (The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex (1991) puts the percentage even higher.)  I think it's logical to assume that the overwhelming majority of these women were neither lesbians nor performing the act by themselves, but with male partners. The figure can therefore safely be extended to the population at large, give or take a few percentage points.  Given that most conservative estimates place the entire gay population of the U.S. at 3-5% (some ultra-right groups place it even lower), taken with the uncontestable facts that 1) few lesbians indulge in penetrative anal sex, and 2) a significant portion of gay men don't either, it becomes clear that, in raw numbers, the number of heterosexuals who are having anal sex far surpasses the number of gay people doing the same."
3311,"Your argument is akin to saying  We can't stop people over-dosing on heroin, so let's legalise it   Why have limitations on hand-grenades or mines? People use mines all over the world for bad. Obviously laws aren't going to work... but perhaps the laws are also suggestive of a particular ethos; a set of standards that the community believe are necessary for a civil society. Thus, a nation such as New Zealand, or Australia, promotes a more 'community-minded' citizen then an 'individualisticlly-minded' citizen. This also carries over into general attitudes towards one's neighbours. In America, you're in fear that what little you have is going to be plundered by blacks or hispanics, or commies or someone. Even the government's out to rip away your rights. This 'seige' mentality permeates American society.  For the interest of those who aren't aware, gun ownership for self-protection (from nasty criminals) is not protected by the Constitution ... it is written to state that a well-armed militia is necessary for the protection of rights."
3312,Or should we go to federal coda pertaining to the militia?
3313,"You need to read the whole article before you make such statements. The point of the article is that the provisions for divorce that are available to heterosexual married couples are NOT available to same-sex married couples because of the discriminatory federal law (DOMA) and because of state laws that do not recognize same-sex marriage, thus not allowing for legal divorce.  Read the whole article and see what you think. Shouldn't all married couples have access to equal rights and provisions for division of property when they divorce?"

I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage, but once its in its third trimester, you have no right to kill it."

3318,"Some interesting information, that website where you got your link from, ""Reasons To Believe"" (RTB) is not a creationist organisation. It is run by compromising Christians, such as Dr Hugh Ross. Answers in Genesis have got quite a lot of information on him and as a result have even more rebuttals to his arguments. Here are several links:http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4149.asp http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4128.asp I did notice, however, that the RIB article was written in the year 1999. This is most pecular, because the AiG article in which Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself is written in the year 2000. The following link is a very brief summary of how Dr Humphreys defended himself and his new Relativistic Cosmology from compromising Christians and evolutionists:http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs...10-10-2000.asp The following link is where Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself. It shows both the arguments and his rebuttals:http://www.trueorigin.org/ca_rh_03.asp I would strongly suggest that you read it.I can definitely see how you may doubt Dr Humphreys new Cosmology, that was a pretty heavy attack, the much of it went zip, right over my head. But I just can't help but feel that they mis-interpreted several lines and are using some straw man attacks. I personally cannot see anything wrong with his arguments, although if there is, he has given way for a new area of cosmology, a Creationist Cosmology. I hope that this helps clear up this little problem regarding ""Starlight and Time"". Got to go,Matt."

3322,"Oh, and I found this from here:http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291""The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.""It appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. And the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. The only one getting anything wrong here is you."
3323,"Well, your question doesn't need the macro bit in there as evolution happens or it doesn't, the ""macro"" bit is once again an artifact of our view on the world (ie. our short lives make it rather difficult to see evolution shape anything other than the organisms with the fastest of reproductive cycles.) Given we have evidence of life (fossils) changing over time (radiometric dating and stratigraphy) we know it takes many of thousands, if not millions of years for noticable to-the-eye changes in animals to occur. Once again it is important to consider perspective- we only have the equivalent of a few frames (fossils) from the movie of life (geological time) and there is much that is lost to history forever. Still, enough remains to support evolution, unless you were to purposefully disregard the facts we find.On your final point it is rather out of context, and I suspect not accidentally so. I'm not sure what on earth consitutes ""convincing evidence"" for any philosphical outlook on life, be it theistic or otherwise."

3327,"So thatÂ’s it Â– thereÂ’s nothing else to study on the subject? The process you describe naturally takes long periods of time. Do you wonder if, during this process, information/health/life could lie dormant for long periods of time, or if it would have to make some of its changes close to the time when other things changed, or when the system became operational? In mid-2001, the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics jointly presented the true nature and complexity of the digital code inherent in DNA. We now understand that each human DNA molecule is comprised of chemical bases arranged in approximately 3 billion precise sequences. Even the DNA molecule for the single-celled bacterium, E. coli, contains enough information to fill all the books in any of the world's largest libraries. ID proponents are often accused of saying Â“goddidit, that settles it, stop lookingÂ”, and it seems that atheists do that quite often as well. Can you quote any ID proponent saying what you said, that Â“we donÂ’t need to develop exact pathsÂ…Â”? Behe can describe exploration of paths, that arenÂ’t being explored to any great extent now. (too religious, don't-cha-know ) In his words; Â“Since the simplest possible design scenario posits a single cell Â–formed billions of years ago Â– that already contained all information to produce descendant organisms, studies could test this scenario by attempting to calculate how much DNA would be required to code the information (keeping in mind that much of the information might be implicit) lf DNA alone is insufficient, studies could be initiated to see if information could be stored in the cell in other ways Â– for example, as positional information. Other work could focus on whether larger, compound systems (containing two or more irreducibly complex systems) could have developed gradually or whether there are compounded irreducibilities.Â”  Â“Blind, purposeless, happenstance nature did it, that settles it, stop lookingÂ”? Is that your answer? Is the type of study Behe describes something for atheists to be afraid of?"

3343,Probably not. Very rarely do I run into a anti-abortionist who actually has a viable plan for decreasing what they protest. In fact some of the most ardent anti-abortion people I've met are also some of the most ardent anti-comprehensive sexual education people as well.

3344,"Really? So suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. You measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. In ten years you make actual measurements. The predictions of the first model for Mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. The second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (For comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- I may be wrong about this). So, are you saying the first model is wrong? The error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). What about the second?"

3346,"Ok, I'm going to have to question your statement as far as this post goes.I really don't like the fact that you brought out, how African Americans, abort because of poverty, and low education. But white people abort for different reasons. That is basicly what you said. I find that to be an insult. My cousin, was not poor, nor was she uneducated when she had her abortions. As well as my sister. I think that is some kind of rasist idea that alot of people like to keep as regards to black people. Because I never saw you pin a reason, on why white people abort. But in your mind its understandable. But WOE! To the uneducated black folks! Then you go on to state that black people should in fact take advantage of the higher education, and sports provided for them.By that statement, it seems to me as if you're implying that black people don't take the oppurtunity to benefit ourselves. Need I remind you, that black people are leading in the sports world. And that there are thousands of black people who are taking advantage of higher learning.And what is your advice for those who are white, who lead uneducated lives, and abort because of being poor. Believe it or not, there are alot in that situation. So don't you dare classify one race. And assume, they are uneducated, and poor. Thus they have abortions. Expecially since I see that with people of all races. It seems to me like you never took that into consideration."
3347,"parcum, they are like any other medical facility, saying this is like saying that just because my physician just happens to be do some surgeries, he will always tell me I need to have a surgery- because of course, he will make more money off me then. You dont like the fact that planned parenthood performs abortions, and so you feel the need to slanderize them. Some rabid pro=lifer told you that, and you swallowed it hook, line and sinker. You obviously have no clue into the idea of customer service- which is the field I work in. You try to do whatever is in the best interest of the customer, even if it sends them to your competition. IN the case of planned parenthood, it is against their policy to recommend that a patient do anything but dicuss it with their own support system, be that friends, family, clergy or whatever. Any employee of theirs who breaks that policy is making them liable for legal recourse, and will also be likely to lose their job.I wonder, does your high school offer logic courses?

I was famous for getting on the highway and cruising at 80 or 85 mph in a 65.

3356,"Just as you have a background in science Frog, I also have an extensive background in Christianity. A brief synopsis: starting at birth I was without consent given the supposed ""gift"" of Catholic faith. In highschool I met a kid and later on a girlfirend who were both Born Again Christians. I thought I'd dabble in it. The girlfirend and I went our seperate ways, but I remained a Christian and began studying the Bible. The transformations in me were mostly bad and far beyond the scope of this (we can discuss it on a different forum), but one important thing occured when I began studying the Bible in earnest. I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored. Don't ask me what they were because, again, this is not the religious forum and I'd be hard pressed to even tell you what they were, but I assure you there was a time I could quote them chapter and verse. Since that time I have tried my best to forget it. I realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible. I knew that if I pulled back from that, attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures, I could perhaps save my Christian faith. But I didn't want to become an apologist. So, in my mind I travelled east. I dabbled in Taoism and Buddhism which appealed very much to my love of Asian history. After a year or two of this, when I discovered there was also a strict theology behind these Asian religions, and it was not just a matter of reading Thomas Merton, meditating and burning incense, I realized that I had been acting like a rich divorced woman with much too much time on her hands (Think of the British sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"" --- greatest show of all time after Seinfeld), and that if you're really goign to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface. It was then, when all religious answers seemed to elude me, that I subscribed to agnosticism: athiesm with a parachute as my old English professor used to say. And on that note I remain today. I don't know the answer and therefore will not comment. Through all of it, however, one philosophy has given me freedom: the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we don't have the answers. Do you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago, and I can take their word for it? Hell, Frog, I don't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today, let alone 2000 years ago. I open the newspaper always skeptical. If you tell me something, you'd better be able to support it.Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims, publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests (or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design). The problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible. A bad comparison, but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so. Exceprts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water. I call Bible-thumpers mindless because this has been my experience, Frog. Up close and personal. They think inside the very tiny box of their scriptures and ask that we accept it by faith. But the basis by which we're really accepting it is widescale social acceptance. If enough people, enough books, enough teachers point to this single source and say ""it is truth,"" then the cud-chewing masses will usually fall in line. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am going to buy it. I would prefer listening to people, books and teachers who point to many different sources and say this is truth. If I want to see evidence of the Bible I can read the Bible. If I want to see evidence of evolution I can visit our excellent museum of natural history here in Pittsburgh. If I want to discuss evidence of the Bible I can talk to someone who has read the Bible. If I want to discuss evidence of evolutoin I can talk to someone who has read books from many different disciplines of scientific thought. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about the Bible I can open the Bible. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about evolution I can go outside, take a walk in the woods, scribble in my notebook and come back to this forum with a 47 page post full of questions: the important point here being that others like Lurch and Demon would either be able to answer them or point me in the right direction of someone who can.

3357,"Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"". Of course this ""law"" does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms, but it does hold for a few cases. And that's enough to clearly indicate evolution of those organ systems by their being retained from ancestors and then modified during embryonic development."

3369,"The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:""It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.""The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state.

3380,"Well, ""reasonable"" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?"

3386,"Here's my guess:  If would think that repeated attempts such as these found nothing or found something contrary to what was predicted, this could be considered failure of the hypothesis' and hence the theory's predictive value. I don't really know (or if anyone could estimate) what the probability of finding such a fossil would be. If it is highly unlikely in thew first place (and failure of fossils to fossilize is one thing that makes this more unlikely) then a single instance of finding nothing, would not really falsify much. Even so, I don't see how this means that finding something is not a validation.  Actually, I know next to little about the processes involved in paleontological research, so maybe I am speaking out of my elbow in this post. I just was impressed that the fossil was not found by happenstance."
3387,"The pro-life position isn't even formost about the law. It is about stopping abortions, period. That is why so many pro-life people work in counseling centers, not legal offices.

I am certainly pro-life, but I don't oppose very early term abortions or when the life of the mother is in definite danger."

3394,"The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason, or in the emphasis on individuality, or in the belief that humans are self motivated, or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system. The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason, and therefore there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge, and absolute moral and immoral thought and action. For Objectivists, once a principle has been discovered through reason to be True, that is the end of the discussion. If you disagree with the principle, then your reasoning is flawed.

For example, many versions have 're-interpreted' or re-translated' various verses to reflect certain political views and ideologies (which I find disgusting). For example, I have heard of a version that now singles out ""abortionists"" as evil-doers, and I have had a hard time tracking down online bibles that contain the actual KJV of Luke 14:26 - many have removed the word ""hate"" and replaced with a more conservatively correct ""love less"", which is not even what the original Greek was...So, not being able to find certain verses does not mean that they are made-up or otherwise inaccurate, it may be that various versions have altered/omitted some of them..."

One of the apocryphical texts may very well be written by Thomas, the apostle Thomas. None of the writers of the four well known Gospels were apostles, right? They were writers, heard the story quite a few years after and do not agree on all that much actually. There are definitely four different stories on how he was crucified for instance."
3403,"Well you just made the ultimate mistake. Trying to justify things based on your belief in God skews your views and doesn't allow you to make a logical decision anyways. This has basically just become a religious debate instead of one on abortion and I think if you want to find the answer to this question you will need to debate on the Religion board.Also if everything that occurs is Gods will, then isn't it Gods will that an abortion take place if it does occur?I won't debate that an aborted baby could have been responsible for an important event in the future if it had been born, but this is a rare event. I submit to you this idea as well if you like the cases of rare events. What if one of those babies grew up and killed someone who would be responsible for an important future event had he lived long enough to do so? That is a rare case as well. I'm sure you will say this doesn't justify abortion and I'll agree with you because both our points about low probability instances are so rare that they shouldn't matter in this debate anyways."

3407,"The big bang theory actually describes the universe very well and is the best working model we have. No one has developed a complete model of the universe that can describe all observations. That doesn't make the model completely false, it just makes it incomplete.Back in the day, Newtonian physics was dominant. Then came Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing), and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that. There are problems with General Relativity, which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe.I'm going to say it again: the model isn't wrong, its incomplete. Models get replaced by better models that better fit our observations.Big Bang merely describes the way the universe works, it doesn't make any predictions as to what was responsible for setting these events in motion."

You come on about once a month, spread a bunch of bull, and then run like to hide where it's safe and contradicting opinions can't reach you.  It'll force them to focus more on actual crimes rather than harassment tactics."
3427,#1 - Evolution continues today. Some organisms evolve relatively quickly. It has and is being observed. Do some research.  #2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena. It must have happened by itself if there is no Creator. There are several theories about the specifics. I happen to think lightning was involved.  #3 - It is thought humans evolved  away  from the other apes due to environmental pressures. When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate. That change in climate forced our ancestors from the trees which somehow contributed to our  rapid  and unprecedented brain development.  #4 - Geology and radioactive isotopes.

I suppose, even being a pro-lifer, that I could get behind justifying an abortion due to rape in consideration of the unwilling, violent conception and the mental trauma of the mother BUT I think that the rape should be reported within 24 hours for the person to qualify for this  loophole.  It should be reported BEFORE the victim is aware of any pregnancy. Coming forth weeks or months after the fact is too suspicious and gives the appearance that they are just crying rape as an excuse for a justified abortion."

3444,"Well, here is the article from the BBC yesterday. That article puts it here.  Eusthenopteron -> Panderichthyes -> Tiktaalik -> Acanthostega -> Ichthyostega  There are other examples of transitionals in the gap where they have placed Tiktaalik. From the age (383 million years), it would have fit in to the sequence like this. Panderichthyes -> Tiktaalik -> Elginerpeton -> Ventastega -> Metaxygnathus -> Acanthostega -> Ichthyostega  Of course I do not mean to imply that any of these is ancestral to any other. Venastega, for example, is more primative in form that Acanthostega, and something like Venastega would be expected in the transitional sequence. However, it was almost contemproaneous with Acanthostega.  And I'm not sure where to put Pederpes finneyae. It is apparently not as old as Tiktaalik. It would also date to the same period between Panderichthys and Acanthostega known as Romer's Gap.  Per Ahlberg posted a  hint  about Tiktaalik on the IIDB evolution board on March 30. Two articles and a News &amp; Views piece by Per and Jenny Clack were published in Nature today. NEWS There are pictures in Nature"

3447,"Well, I can more easily explain what it is NOT.In my latter ID days, I was arguing for a form of Directed Panspermia, with the aliens themselves having arisen by purely natural means - starting off as simpler organisms than us, but then evolving intelligence - and then creating life as we know it. Without getting into details, imagine what we humans will probably due in 100 years or so: create a new form of life (robotic) that is vastly different than our own and probably more complex. And it is a form of life we would be more likely to send out into space than ourselves, and that is better suited for being send out to other planets than we are. Analogously, imagine a form of alien life unlike that as we know it creating bacterial life and then sending it out in spaceships to populate other worlds. With our form of life being designed by a different form of life and rocketed here, that would be intelligent design of life as we know it.However, that is NOT what the ID movement holds ID to be: their's is a religious position down to its core, as became even more clear in the Dover, PA court case.Also, one could argue that Intelligent Design is a fact. When humans create a novel amino acid sequence, or modify a bacterium to perform a specific target function, then we are practicing intelligent design in biology. But that is NOT what the ID movement means. Theirs is a religious position that uses human design as an analogy, not as their goal.As far as Behe's ID, he made it clear in his Darwins' Black Box and in court in the Dover, PA case that he can't say much of anything about ID. He can't tell WHEN the designs were created, HOW the designs were instantiated, by WHOM or ""WHOMS"" the designs were created, or WHERE the designs and instantiations occurred. He's got 0 details. Yet he rejects evolution - despite the tons of evidence - because not every single I has been dotted in the origin of the bacterial flagellum. Behe strains out a gnat yet swallows a camel."
3448,"Chemist 99a: [quotre]Ok then remove the brain and see whats left of the mind.[/quote]  Bertvan: Would a memory exist without a language to describe it?  Chemist99a:  Bertvan: I would not discourage any scientist from searching for volition in computers. I would not urge that such scientists be excluding from science for continuing such a search. I don?t even think such a search ?endangers science?. In the meantime it is too bad materialists don?t feel the same way about scientists investigating the role of immaterial forces such as volition and memory in living processes.  Chemist 99a:  Bertvan: I?ve never seen a nonliving process exhibit volition, and I see evidence that all living organisms, including plants and sponges show some limited ability to respond creatively to stimuli. More from the article by WascallyWabbit:  Intelligent Design  Bertvan As unlikely as the notion of ?natural selection? organizing genetic accidents into intelligently functioning systems, it is the only origin of biological novelty materialists have been able to come up with, the only explanation that doesn?t include some form of volition and purposeful response.  Bertvan: (I?ve substituted EAM for ?Darwinism? because today few Darwinists would acknowledge that adaptations originate in living organisms rather than their genomes. Most Darwinists are still stuck on versions of genetic accidents.) All organisms some ability to respond to stimuli. I agree that plants and sponges seem to have a lesser choice of optional responses than more complex organisms. Yet even they are capable of some creative response. I?ve seen evidenceconvincing to me that even single cultured cells are capable of some limited free response. However the options available to a DNA molecule must be miniscule. Yet the Darwinists seem to grant pieces of DNA the power to ?selfishly? control entire organisms.  Bertvan: Every living organism and every cell of every living organism has some limited ability to change and adapt in response to stimuli, intelligently and purposefully. Once volition is acknowledged as an aspect of living systems, the mechanisms may be found.  Bertvan: Darwin may have been skeptical or reductionism, but twentieth century biologists who called themselves Darwinists were not. Twenty-first century biologists will turn away from materialistic reductionism and investigate the non materialistic role of consciousness, volition, memory and information -- none of which take up space."
3449,"The ID movements form of ID states that there are  large gaps  in the theory of evolution that can only be explained by the presence of a supernatural designer. Behe is happy to think that it is the christian god (like the rest of them), but they arn't allowed to say that, because if they do, they violate that annoying ammendment!  The ID argument is not scientific, because it's not falsifiable, and has no supporting evidence. The ID movement relies solely on LACK of evidence for evolution, which is complete bunk. Just because we don't know yet, it doesn't mean that godditit. (Incedentally, most of Behe's claims of  Irreducible Complexity  are already destroyed by science, as DamEtel will be more than happy to explain.)"

What's important though, is that the paramount concern should be that a woman must retain the right to control her own body all semantics of when life begins aside. For there to be true equality between the sexes (which I feel is one of the most important conditions to having a truly free, just, and legitimate society) woman must be able to stand on equal footing and they can't do that if they don't have some means of control over their reproductive systems."

3459,"Well, that's your own strong bias speaking. Many of the courts and scholars have disagreed with you."
3460,"Your argument, I believe. The one I said doesn't hold water. It appears to claim that the placing of restrictions upon items specifically designed for the killing of other human beings is somehow comparable to and a prelude for the banning of everyday items whose intended use is in no way connected to harm of others. Your title then equates this with a step towards a form of government in which one person is afforded executive, legislative and judiciary power over the country they control."

So once again I must ask, if they have this evidence on tape, why were no arrests made? Supposedly these are licensed investigators, fully authorized and everything. Why did they choose to let a blatant offense go unpunished? By law and duty they were obligated to make arrests on the scene."
3463,yea but ToE doesn't say mammals evolved from sponges -- it says we evolved from reptiles.
3464,OK try the US Constitution. We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation. Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited. Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority. Amibiguity and sharing of interests in various types of personal and social decisions is a necessary component of this system. We are built on compromise and that has served us well.

I believe the Bible fully supports the idea of free will and even assuming that it says nothing at all, based on the way some things go it is hard to believe a good God would not only allow it to happen, but to make it happen is even worse. I mean, what else is there? If we don't have free will and God is the ultimate power, then he must be the one making decisions for us. Can't blame the Devil for everything. Nah I guess you could, but that wouldn't make God sound too good either if he was letting all of his prized creations have their fake lives destroyed by a demon."
3471,"The deceived one is you Brady. How many of those alleged lives taken by gun violence were police shootings? How many by gang memebrs killing other gang members? Where did you come up with your figures Brady, VPC your namesake group? They are thoroughly discredited as you should realize by now. How many are suicides? The prevention models for these are different in case you were unaware. You fail to even consider how many of those lives were taken by criminals in the commission of a crime. Yet you would render us helpless to them in your quest for a non hostile working environment. Show exactly where in the constitution and Bill of Rights the wording for gun control. Here is a clue, they aren't there. If you were truely concerned about loss of innocent life then you would be supporting laws to keep the violent criminal away from society. Instead they are free after many arrests and convictions to prey upon a society that you would render helpless. Why Brady?"
3472,Very well-executed skewering of Galileo. emoticon_xagree
3473,"Actually, since Darwin first proposed his theories, the have not been falsified. Your assumptions and unsupported claims certainly don't do so."
3474,"An abortion is an abortion. Your emotional use of the word  euthanasia  is pointless and irrelevant. Either you object to abortion or you don't. Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash.  I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion).  Don't like it? ... TOUGH!  And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself."
3475,"Nope. No contradiction from Old to New.Deut 20: 1 When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses and chariots, a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them. For Jehovah your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. 2 And it shall be, when you draw near to battle, the priest shall come and speak to the people, 3 and say to them. Hear, Israel, you are drawing near today to battle against your enemies. Do not let your heart be faint; do not fear nor tremble, nor be terrified before their faces. 4 For Jehovah your God is He who is going before you, to fight for you with your enemies, to save you. 5 And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, who is the man that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man dedicate it. 6 And who is the man that has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle, and another man use its fruit. 7 And who is the man who has betrothed a woman, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in the battle, and another man take her. 8 And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, Who is the man who is afraid, and faint of heart? Let him go and return to his house; then the heart of his brothers will not melt like his heart. 9 And it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, commanders of the armies shall be appointed at the head of the people.10 When you come near a city to fight against it, then call to it for peace. 11 And it shall be, if it answers peace to you, and shall open to you, then it shall be that all the people found in it shall be forced laborers for you, and shall serve you. 12 And if it shall not make peace with you, and shall make war with you, then you shall lay siege against it. 13 And Jehovah your God shall give it into your hand; and you shall strike every male of it by the mouth of the sword. 14 Only, the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all in the city, all its plunder, you shall seize for yourself. And you shall eat the plunder of your enemies which Jehovah your God has given to you. 15 So you shall do to all the cities very far away from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 16 But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance, you shall not keep alive any that breathes. 17 But you shall utterly destroy them the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as Jehovah your God has commanded you; 18 so that they may not teach you to do according to all their filthy deeds which they have done for their gods; and you would sin against Jehovah your God. 19 When you shall lay siege to a city many days, to fight against it, to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees in order to force an axe against them. For you shall eat of them, and you shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field a man that it should be used by you to lay siege? 20 Only the tree which you know not to be a fruit tree, you may destroy it, and may cut it down, and may build a bulwark against the city making war with you, until you have subdued it."

3478,"We accept plasticity, but we do not accept that plasticity can account for what has been attributed to mutations and natural selection. It has only been observed to change minor phenotypes (shell thickness, type of bee).By the way, you have contended before that plasticity can cause a fish to change in response to predators (which benefits the fish). Now, you are trying to say that life doesn't evolve or change in any beneficial way.Cite your sources and make up your mind!"

3481,"Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfmIt is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something."
3482,"Bad, bad, bad. :( 1) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.1) Some, perhaps all ""Livestock feed"" is actually edible for humans; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico.2) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten."
3483,"Because I am one who likes see things from different angles. What better way to fight your enemies then to understand their viewpoint. Before I am attacked on the the last statement, just because I understand a viewpoint does not meant that I accept it as true or that I don't reject it."

3485,"So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.  You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions (a point I don't really care about) but unrelated to this topic...so if you want to talk about that, start another thread.  So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers?"
3486,"So you're saying your unwilling to discuss it, and you think that an oblique ad hominem (fitting in with nut cases) is a way to progress this topic?"

3489,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"

3493,NO ONE HAS TO HAVE A GUN! The point is is that the choice should be up to the individual. If a criminal thinks you are armed he will move on (or he has a death wish)
3494,because that's the subject of this thread: what designing a solution to a problem actually entails.
3495,"This argument is a poor one for the following reasons;  If there is no  sanctity of life , that is people do not have a right to their own bodies, then a woman can not have a right to an abortion, since the right to an abortion depends on this very same principle.  Specific rights, like  right to an abortion ,  right to free speech  are not free floating propositions, they are part of a structure of rights which is logically intertwined. The supporting superstructure cannot be removed while leaving the specific rights intact.  Clearly a baby is both genetically distinct from the mother, and at least at some stage in development acquires a completely independent biological system and consciousness. I'm not sure what you mean by this.  I also don't see how your  worldview  can determine these things, whether a baby is a bodily function of a woman or not seems to me a case of empirical fact, not ideology."
3496,"You will never help the poor with a socialist system. The first casuality of a socialist state is the spirit of charity. The concept of charity in European societies does not exist, because it is the government job to the help the poor.  Government officials just don't strike me as being natural care givers. What then happens is you get a token  official  who pretends to give a rats pututie for carring about the poor, to make all the heartless people in a socialist state feel good that the government is doing something."
3497,"No wonder we here in the U.S. are complaining about the stead flow of narcotics and drug gang violence flowing from the Mexican Violent Drug Cartel. No wonder we are complaining that the Mexican authorities have been complicit, and even corrupt, taking this illegal drug money and for allowing this problem to get this big and this bad.  Now the only way out of it is to blame me?"
3498,"Actually, it hasn't. Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor. Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences. It isn't that the DNA is different, what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different."

Would you suggest that people who think that is wrong should not impose their belief system on me? You would certainly think they should impose their belief system on me. Chances are you would say something like  well, I am a human so therefore I have certain rights  to which I would respond that chloe and I believe the fetus is a human and we believe you are a human too so therefore the same standard applies.  The argument about not pushing your beliefs on others just never works because every law is pushing beliefs on people."

3502,"The flying spaghetti monster is similar to the term ""flat earthers"" - ridicule without substance. It's much more recent however. It was concocted in June of 2005 by one Bobby Henderson, a young college graduate with a degree in physics. He wrote it as a joke, as a response when the Kansas board of education took up the question of the teaching of ID in schools. That web page is a long one, with all the little pictures & everything. It probably started more simply than that, and grew after it became the cult hit that it did. It got attention on many other websites, and in the press as well. The Washington Post reprinted it word for word, and a New York Times headline read ""But is there intelligent spaghetti out there?"" With that kind of publicity for a view that desperately gropes for talking points, it's not surprising that it comes up in many debates here. We should be able to get far beyond it in this debate - are you prepared? :) Both terms, ""flat earthers"" and ""spaghetti monster"" seem to come up much more often than ""happenstance origins"", or even ""Darwinism"", a 150 year old concept that's troubled by several recent discoveries. Happenstance origins is a serious term - I used it in my opening affirmative argument, and you haven't touched it. Can you?"
3503,"So you don't believe that God took a rib from Adam's side to create woman?  Genesis 2:21-23  So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said,   This is now bone of my bones  and flesh of my flesh;  she shall be called 'woman,'  for she was taken out of man.   lurch:  I don't have time to quote everything you said so I'll just comment on it.  You guys keep saying that  of course, religion and science can co-exist perfectly . When did I say that they couldn't? I simply said that fundamentalist Christianity and evolution could not co-exist. Catholics are a perfect example, they do not believe that they can pray to God directly. They believe that they have to pray through a priest, saint, etc. That is not fundamentalist Christianity. You keep trying to make an argument out of something that I am not arguing about.  You also say that creationism cannot co-exist with  science . You say that evolution is science. If creationism can't co-exist with evolution, then how can there be any evolution believing Christian fundamentalists? (thistown for example.) Creationism, by the way, is used very broadly. It is simply the study of how we were created, just as evolution is the study of how we  evolved . They can be used to mean the same thing if you are a Christian who believes in evolution.  BTW, science isn't the  evil work of Satan . It's man's way of trying to explain something so that they don't have to believe in something that threatens the way they enjoy living. (The Bible.)"

The 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us.

This law simply makes it legal for those who have their CCW to carry in Nat'l parks too.They ALREADY carry everywhere else. The Brady bunch makes it sound like there's something about the border of a park that will make us drooling, neanderthal gun owners flip our lids....but just in the park. Why are we perfectly safe everywhere else, but all of a sudden, we're dangerous......in the park?"

If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.  Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government."
3512,"A lot more truth to this statement that a person would think. My statement was in jest, but somewhat true.

3513,"How else should it be done? It is a constiturionally protected right. To eliminate that right, the constitutional protection must be removed first, is the removal itself, becomes unconstitutional."
3514,"Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata."
3515,"Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes."

3520,Of course evolutionists want to remove any possible religious connotation from evolutionary teaching. Evolution isn't science and to introduce religion has been found unconstitutional several times. And you are actually on a school board making decisions about what children are taught? How sad.
3521,Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.
3522,"Because they don't know any better. Besides, how many unwanted pregnancies have you had? How many abortions? Notice that most anti-choicers are men, which exposes the true hypocrisy in this dogma of thinking."

3524,"Walking-fish:A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating. They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable. Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth, such as Robt Gentry's Polonium halos, rate of decay in the earth's magnetic field, rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth. This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates. Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries. So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands, hire a young earth creationist."

Second, the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an XXXXX and a big fraidy cat. Because of his loonicy, too many people lost jobs wrongfully (and lives) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened.  Besides, the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place. They were more of a threat to themselves."

3552,"Too late, drug usage has already created those epidemics. Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily, but they already exist. I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain."
3553,And what's so wrong about that?
3554,"No, but the first trimester makes my point stronger, and given that 95-98% of abortions happen then it is a valid distinction."
3555,"I think I'm going to start a ""Hope After Propoganda"" site after reading that.  But really where the agony comes is when women go through with an unwanted pregnancy. Abortions usually solve a lot of women's problems, and most women never regret it."

3559,"So then, are we to presume that you would favor the sale and distribution of, to take the worst possible example, kiddie porn with no restrictions?  After all, the First Amendment says  Congress shall make NO LAW abridging freedom of the press.  BTW, re. Texas v. Johnson: Is a flag burning speech, and where in the Constitution does it say so?  I agree with the decision, which simply goes to prove that even a blind Antonin can find a peanut now and then."
3560,so whats your belief of how life/the universe began lurch? (if any)

3563,"both sides of the debate ?  It would be a lot better if you could supply SUBSTANTIATED FACTS instead of wildly inaccurate claims.  Let's start simple.  The original article documents the CBO's observations on the Republican plan.  By 2019, CBO and JCT estimate, the number of nonelderly people without health insurance would be reduced by about 3 million relative to current law, leaving about 52 million nonelderly residents uninsured. The share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage in 2019 would be about 83 percent, roughly in line with the current share.How do you justify claims about  covering only a fraction more ?  Unless you're talking about  covering only a fraction more  THAN THE STATUS QUO, and significantly less than the Democrat plan...  THAT I agree with."
3564,You're babbling.
3565,"Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere."
3566,It is the same as you saying  you can't know anything of the unknowable 
3567,But your own link says that the rise in crime was partially explained by the new system the UK police were using for recording crime and that the British Crime Survey showed a decrease in crime since 1997.
3568,"But you know it is more then just that. The poster gave a specific date that is relevant to when abortion was legalized. It shows the poster is being selective and may hold prejudice to fetuses who aren’t aborted by legal abortions. You see, it is the pro-life movement's selective outrages that makes me think they aren't serious about abortion as a whole. "
3569,"The advantage of being armed . . . the Americans possess over the people of all other nations . . .

3571,"And there is the difference. The postings I was particularly speaking of have to do with court decisions (such as Cruikshank) where hlaf a paragraph, entirely out of context, is quoted to support the anti-gun viewpoint.  I have looked at the major anti-gun web pages, I recognise a cut and paste job when I see one. Cutting and pasting a bunch of statistics is one thing, doing the same and making it your entire argument is ignorant."
3572,Because of my rH factor I have had several spontaneous abortions. I have never needed to have an induced abortion.  I am very sorry to note that I felt not a whit of regret over my abortions. I had more important things to attend to.
3573,"Yes. But that means that the cat  kind , a single pair, produced 4 genera with 36 species in, at most, a couple hundred years. And that doesn't even include domestic cats. It makes the head of any evolutionary biologist spin! Creationists who wish to deny evolution invoke hyperevolution for thousands of  kinds  to yield millions of species in hundreds of years. And yet, they deny evolution."
3574,"Well, scientists in the appropriate fields of science are working on that. I'm not a cosmologist so I rely on scientists in those fields to research those questions. I'm a biologist. I deal with questions of biology, that is living organisms. That is why I am concerned with how living organisms change through time. In other words, that is why I am concerned with evolution. While physicists, cosmologists, geologists and so on may accept evolutionary theory, that doesn't mean that their fields of science are ""evolution."""

3576,"Actually energy can be caused by matter. Newton's Theory of Gravitation shows that gravity is an effect of the presence of mass. The presence of a second mass within the gravitation field of the first mass gives the matter gravitational potential energy, which, without an opposite force to balance it, is converted into kinetic energy."
3577,"Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.  ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.  ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?"
3578,"Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals."
3579,"Actually that is exactly what it is. A theory is nothing more then an explanation of the relation of observations.  Or from the Webster dictionary:  the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one another  or from Wikipedia  A theory is in this context a set of hypotheses that are logically bound together  or from the text  Inquiry into Life  by Sylvia S. Mader  A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses.  I assume your refute stems from observations of the common refute that is used in refuting people who call a theory simply a  hunch  or  guess,  but as I did not define it in such a way your statment has been misapplied. A theory is in fact an  educated guess  based on fact (which I would of thought redundant) about how those facts may interact (which is what I pretty much stated above). You will most likely find no reputable source stating anything else (though they may use jargon) Scientific or other wise."

It means it shouldn't single out a religion. It shouldn't teach something just because it's religious, but it also shouldn't not teach something just because it's religious. Making a law banning the teaching of abiogenesis and ID as hypothesies would violate the first amendment because the only reason we would be banning it would be because of the establishment of religion. And even if the first amendment does say what you seem to think it does, you think the solution is to violate the first amendment more to balance it?"

Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless. My answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the Bible because they told of how Abraham tied his XXX to a tree and Jesus sat on his XXX in Jerusalem. Didn't phase them. They also ignored without comment references to Judge Roy Moore's monumental erection in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court building. Yanking fundy chains can be so much fun sometimes."
3587,"Yep, homosexuals join to practice a religion that hates them just so they can gain access to children.

3591,Not sure why you think this is science or how it is supposed to apply to a discussion of creationism v evolution. Science is not materialistic but naturalistic.
3592,The doctor would have to gain something for it to be exploitation. What does he gain? You see when you offer someone something for free that they might really want but can't afford it's called charity. When you suggest that these women need someone else doing their thinking for them it's called misogyny. Clear?
3593,"The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.  Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK."

3595,Humans cannot cleanse themselves of their sins.
3596,"And I'm saying all but 16 states had already had the law removed before the Loving case. Most of these were done via the legislature and very few had the law overturned by a court. In fact, only California comes to mind as a state that had the statue overturned by the courts instead of on repeal by the legislature.  Who knew...but there is a wikipedia page on this: Anti-miscegenation laws - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  It doesn't say whether or not it was via a court case or not but I know that California was a court case and Massachusetts and many Northern/mid-west state were via legislature action.  Also, the Supreme Court case ruled the Virginia law unconstitutional not the Alabama law. It is just understood that similar laws will be overturned thus they are negated."
3597,"Certainly... just like how the makers of Expelled have repeatedly refused to publish the interviews in full. It's not just that PZ and Dawkins object to the content of the movie -- the makers of Expelled don't want them to be able to object in the first place. It's always been their favorite argument against PZ to dangle over the head of his criticisms the fact that he hasn't even seen the movie. They can't pull that one on Dawkins anymore, which is to their disadvantage, but fortunately they managed to spot PZ before it was too late."
3598,"No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and  a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious."
3599,Indeed there is no diffrence it is still a dead baby but throwing a baby in a trash can and leaving it for dead is far more cruel than abortion.
3600,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"
3601,"Some in S Africa do not think their gun laws are strict enough. Some in New york city do not think THEIR gun laws are strict enough. This just shows that there are XXXXXX everywhere.In S Africa, you are required to have a permit to own any firearm. Any criminal activity, or ""questionable"" associations result in the refusal of a permit. Over 60% of permit applications are denied, and penalties for posession of an unlicensed weapon are severe. YET, unlicensed weapons outnumber licensed ones.The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element. Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal. They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway. Nobody is going to decide NOT to murder somebody because they fear being charged with illegal posession of a firearm.Gun laws essentially only apply to law abiding citizens. A criminal is, by definition, somebody who does not obey the law. You cannot legislate away criminality."
3602,"You have a habit of constantly posting statements by anti-gun officials. And when these statements and theories are called into question and challenged, you have nothing to post in defense."
3603,Actually it just took GOD a long time to work out the bugs in his ideas thats why humans only appeared very recently. We are special because he took his time to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to build his masterpieces - namely us. We are after all the crown of creation meant to dominate all the inferior life forms and to take whatever we wish from the planet. Are we not?
3604,"I don't give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either(obvious here I am not saying I don't care what happens to either, but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance). Neither one should have a right to kill the other...and for that matter, no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn. So my views are still treating them as equals.  and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can't prove."
3605,"So the fact that there are fewer crimes in britain is evidence, but the fact that there is a great deal more crime in S Africa, despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world, is not? In new york, the reduction in crime was the result of an overhaul of police and the criminal justice system. Couple pages on that:http://www.city-journal.org/html/15_1_ny_crime.htmlhttp://www.ny.gov/governor/patrecord/crime.htmlNew York started instituting prohibitive firearms laws in the 60s. Most of the firearms laws they ""enjoy"" now were put in place in the 70s (except for a brief round of idiocy in the 90's having to do with semi-auto rifles....""assault weapons"", which they banned despite the fact that the police commissioner of NY City testified that they had no record of one ever being used in a crime).So, they had prohibitive gun control for 30+ years, and then when they spent billions on theri criminal justice system and police, none of which had anything to do with gun control, their crime rate started to fall, and somehow you want us to believe that this was due to the gun control? Nobody here is that gullible."
3606,and she got punished for itGood thing too because it led to the law being changed. If someone thought drunk driving was an unrighteous law and so they did it and got punished...I don't think you will see much sympathy. It many states that is probably true for abortion.Why is it unrighteous anyway? Only because you disagree with it :)
3607,Forming something complex =/= increasing capacity and adaption   Yet another lie here:
3608,No surprises that an unemployed former public servant would support increasing the amount he leeches off everyone else.  It's a joke this is even something people would think about at this point. The titanic's sinking and you're thinking about whether to ask for a room with lilac lampshades.
3609,Whose hands do they have?
3610,"Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that.  Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states.  And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court."
3611,"If someone gets busted for providing a firearm to a criminal there is already Serious jail time, regardless of what you say you want. It is totally irrelevant what you or I want. Totally irrelevant. In fact no one is even asking us. We have a whole Federal Department dedicated to gun crimes and criminals. I can understand that you, and apparently people like the Illegal Mayors headed by Bloomberg might think they are not doing the job up to your standards, but Bloomie and his bunch was asked to cease and deist because they were ruining Federal and local investigations. The way I see it, is, you want special privileges with your law. "
3612,"I thought the critical factors were (are);a: When does a child's life begin?b: When does a new child's rights begin?c: What are the possible justifications for denying the rights of the new child (if any)?d: What (if any) should the punishment be for violating the child's rights by killing him or her unjustly?Can we not (at least) agree on what the ""critical factors"" are? If not, isn't all subsequent debate destined to be non-productive?"
3613,"There is some belief within the scientific community that neanderthals cross-bred with sapiens to produce modern-day caucasian Europeans. This explains the big nose, wider head, etc.  ... How could that possibly be racism?"
3614,Yes but if you try to change it to something unrealistic it will not work and we end up with a lot of unwanted children who are very likely to grow up with serious problems.  I can?t think of anything sadder and more immoral then a policy that creates unwanted children as a side effect.  The religious are so worried about the period of time the child is basically not sentient and will make suffer those who are developed enough to actually be sentient all for the luxury of indulging their silly counter productive religious beliefs.
3615,"1) the theories and laws constantly change, so it's not like there's one standard that's benn kept to. At best the 'theories and laws of science' are statements that fit with as many experiences and events as possible  2) If someone reports something against science, it's rejected as 'unscientific'  3) I'm rejecting the certainty of experience, so using experience to prove it is circular"
3616,"Holy grail implies it is like a religion, which it is not. If evidence is found that overturns this theory, it will be discarded in favour of a better one."
3617,"Because my relatives, friends, and even my own family members had at least one abortion each, and abortion is a very traumatizing proceudre, for both the fetus and mother. I'm just keeping the moral and legal right to life."
3618,"Look again. This time, try and put yourself into the time the Bible was written. Try to see things as they did. Then ask yourself how those scriptures fit into that time period. It's not hard. But you may need to take a few classes on how to analyze historical documents and Hermeneutics before you get it."
3619,"Actually, there is. Well over 200 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly imaged by various means. All but Pluto have been found since 1992, and way over half have been found since 1998. I notice that of your references, one was published early in the year that the first (third if you count Pluto and Charon) was discovered, another was published two years later, and the third was published in 1974(!). MY GOD!! 1974! I also notice that none of them have anything to do with comet origin."
3620,A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
3621,But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it.
3622,"Most scientists agree that there needs to be a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order for pain to be registered as such. The cerebral cortex is not sufficiently developed enough in the fetus to feel pain until roughly the start of the third trimester. Otherwise, the movements of an early fetus or embryo away from a stimulus are simply reflex action. Those of you who might have disected a frog in biology class in High School might have experienced it yourself when seeing the leg of a newly dead frog move under stimulus. For the novice, it may appear to be a reaction to a felt pain but it is not.Here is one link to a comprehensive study on fetal pain made by the American Medical Association:http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/294/8/947"
3623,"F--k'in A! right! I don't want some damn MAN deciding what's going to be legal for my body. They have NO experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag, they shouldn't be allowed to decide for us.They have no idea what pregnancy is like, the damage it does to our bodies and our minds, and they don't have to pay to support a child that we were forced to accept at knifepoint.Where is the logic is violating women a second time? Where's the justification for it? Doesn't the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all?Do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you'd be setting up with a total ban on abortion? Women who have been raped and essentially told ""You WILL have this child, you WILL carry it to term, or you WILL go to prison!"" would likely commit suicide as a result, meaning that TWO lives are gonna be lost."
3624,Again I have to correct you. Dark moths were not observed before 1848. Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moths both in Europe and in the United States. Merely claiming that there was no change is ducking the question. You didn't bother to inform yourself of the facts and now you return to your incorrect assertion again and again after having been informed of your error.
3625,"Your logic is that if no one was there to witness it, it therefore did not happen. Under that logic, creation did not happen because no one was there to witness it, God does not count because we can't even prove it exists, much less hold it accountable for being there to witness it. The entire argument based around the witness via your argument is worthless."
3626,"Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman."
3627,"The way the article that MRWrite linked put it is:  In an effort to ease some of these concerns, the drafters of the bill allowed both religious and civil officers to refuse to marry same-sex couples. Gay rights groups criticized this  opt-out  clause, saying they should be treated the same as heterosexual couples. "
3628,"So gun owners are being discriminated for  who they are.  I guess you could put it that way. You could also say that violent killers and serial rapists are being discriminated against for  who they are.  By the way, I support gay marriage but don't support the mayor's actions."
3629,"Certain people include the big bang in the ""general theory of evolution"". This is the statement I made and it is a fact and not ridiculous. I did not discuss the truth of the statement I made the comment the statement is made."
3630,"Please provide evidence that 'there are more fornicators are shacking up' instead of getting married. Or, is that more of your unsupported claims that you are so fond of.  As for perversions, you seem to be very unhealthily concerned with other people's sex lives."
3631,"Yes, yes I did. It was great. I can't get enough of The Daily Show and Jon Stewart  Did you see that Metaphysical Creationist lady? I'm sorry, I try to be non-judgemental, but that lady was a bit kookoo. Not in a dangerous way, just in that  Don't want to take a walk by her house cuz she might get you to come to sayence  kind of way."
3632,"Well, if you know people of color who are adopted then that must mean that there is no problem with the number of children of color who can't be placed in adopted homes!"
3633,And the Big Bang theory sugests a singularity as the beginning...  Not sure what you're getting at here or what that has to do with the Catholic position.
3634,"And once it has begun, which would you rather have?"
3635,"Oh boy, is this what the Anti-gun crowd has come to? Blaming the NRA for... a bombing? I think you have just lost about all credibility with me."
3636,"Yes, and depending on how you define morality.  I'm not asserting that just law can be determined devoid of right or wrong. Just that law should not step every time something is immoral.  Do you? For example, I deduce from your posts that you perhaps see homosexuality as immoral. For you don't think same gender marriage should be allowed. However, I'll venture to guess -- and you can certainly correct me -- that you don't think homosexuality should be illegal. Even though you think it's immoral."
3637,"Yeah, yeah we can all do math. Why do you even bother? You said statistics is just a game. -VOR  Take it seriously."
3638,"For the record, to interested parties reading -- subscribers to evolutionary biology or creationism -- I subscribe to evolutionary biology and having that taught in the public school system. And though I disagree with creationism, I support parents' right to teach their children creationism. For further information, please see the poll discussion."
3639,"Just like the first amendment starts with  Congress shall make no law , which is no less absolute. OR the fourth,  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . Do I need to go on? Every one of the original ten amendments, witht he exception of the 6th and 7th contain strong language that leave no doubts as to the fact that the rights are protected. Yet we DO have laws regarding free speach, the DMCA, etc..."
3640,I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.
3641,"Just because something is genetically predisposed does not mean it has a positive benefit, but I never said that it did. Homosexuality is different, because it has no negative reprocussions that are not caused by something social or religious."
3642,So you mean you cannot show me where I've said anything about my healthcare. So we've finished with that one.
3643,I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.
3644,Is the little baby upset? Too bad.
3645,"The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)  A small exerpt:"
3646,"The whole ""change the definition of marriage"" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings."
3647,I know nothing of Nedow.  That's cutesy btw.
3648,So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough. In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work. But gun ownership is still legal there.
3649,I know that you are a contrarian that gioes out of his way to argue nonsensical points.
3650,"Common sense must prevail. There are always exceptions to every rule. Barring severe physical ailments to the mother or the child, or a rape victim, if anything is done to prevent life from continuing, I can only see it as wrong. I am not a zealot, but I do feel strongly that unnecessarily discarding a developing baby is not a right that anyone should have."
3651,"And yet no other portion of lotts work has been refuted. His methodology has been scrutinized and found to be legitimate. YET, you are willing to completely disregard his work because of an unrelated comment?"
3652,"So is it immoral to kill a human, moral to kill an ape, and somewhat immoral to kill a human/ape hybrid? How about a human with tomato genes spliced in to have shinier skin, is it a bit better to kill them? As far as I know there is no  person gene  per se.  I'm really thinking planet of the Apes here, is it right for the apes to enslave Charlton Heston because he's not Ape? Or would it be right for a bunch of humans to enslave Cornelius on the grounds he isn't human, even though  he can talk ?"
3653,There is NO such thing as  pro-abortion  No one wants every single fetus to be removed. All the more reason why each individual should be able to decide what is best for them at the time they become pregnant.
3654,Tyranny? What happened to Germany a few years after it legalized gun ownership? Hitler rose to power. Ownership of firearms was common in Iraq while Hussein was in power and didn't stop Hussein from being a tyrant.  NYC has also experienced a lot of decreases in crime in recent years. Utah (one of the most pro-gun states) has a higher rape rate than places like New York and California. I have yet to see any smoking gun that guns deter crime.
3655,"the fact that the world is governed by laws of logic is exactly what eliminates god. since logic exists, god is not needed.i suppose you assume that logic needs an intelligent initiator of some sort in order for it to exist? why? logic dictate that adding quantity causes that quantity to increase. this would occur with or without god's existence and needs no devine intervention to be consistently true. logic dictates that a system in equilibrium has a total of equal opposite forces and that the sum of all the forces in the system is 0. this is not contingent on god's presmce either. the more explanations of phenomena that can be logically explained, the less god is needed. god and logic are indirectly proportionate. an increase in logic causes a decrease in god"
3656,"Actually he doesn't believe in a liar God like you, so really it's YOU who's the blasphemer. And he's a Christian, you're a Biblist. He actually follows Christ, you just try to maintain the credibility of your God-Book."

3658,"Police are probably much more aggressive than the average citizen, but most of the time their aggression is channeled against the bad guys. And don't you find it significant that a gun, a symbol and tool of violence, can raise levels of testosterone? What kind of effect does testosterone have on behavior? Dogs become more friendly when testosterone is reduced in their bodies through neutering: ""One of the most important behavioral advantages of castration is that as adults, these dogs will tend to be less aggressive both toward other male dogs and also people. The androgen (male) hormones, of which testosterone is the most important, are responsible for the development of many behavioral patterns. When young puppies are sexually mounting their 7 and 8-week old litter mates this is because of androgen surges in their bodies. The same is true with aggressive behavior.""Benefits of Neutering (Castrating) Male Dogs & Puppies"
3659,That explains Figure 6 of the following? Its a flood zone of a riverbed? How about other areas where there are trees growing through 2 separate coal seams?  Google Image Result for http://www.grisda.org/origins/images/24017-12.jpg  This helps make my point about review of evolutionary books. My personal review of this small part of some book explaining how the petrified forest came to be because of a riverbed elsewhere is a big thumbs down.  If that is the best you got I am looking elsewhere for answers. Shame on you for accepting that from your evolutionary high priest. Can you even see that no explanation was given?
3660,"And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?"
3661,"It's just the same flip flopping over and over. Depending on the argument,  science doesn't exclude the divine , {then switcharoo},  science proves there is no divine.  Just depends on the setting of the argument. (you do have your copy of Victor Stenger's book; God - The failed Hypothesis / how science shows that God does not exist, don't you?  Now you and five trolls will come pouring in here with needling and ad hominem attacks, to cover the weakness of your position. Your taunt of  XXXXXX  already got it started. I probably won't respond - it's funny and depressing at the same time."
3662,It is unclear how this 'natural argument fits in with the concept of rights. We have a right to defend ourselves against maniacs even if it is natural for them with their mental condition to want to kill us.
3663,"But the fact is, that son of God Jesus was a lier and that Bible was just a story book but we are all fool to deify them !"
3664,"Now you're claiming that a gun is a precision machine. Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as  assault weapons  are  inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip . Which is it?  Prove it then.  Then you've got absolutely no justification for supporting gun control, you should be supporting criminal control instead.  Then why do you keep supporting laws that would restrict access to guns, rather than making it harder for violent offenders to get out of prison and back on the streets where they pose the greatest danger?  Then what's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms? Do you fear something in particular? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better?"
3665,"No, and no.  First, evolution provides the only scientific answers for how humans got here: we evolved from non-human ancestors. that record is written in both the genes and the fossils. Science might even be able eventually to tell you what the forces of selection were that propelled this evolution.  Second, Evolutionary theory is NOT a theory of the origins of life: it's a theory about the origins of species once life exists. There is a separate scientific discipline that deals with origins of life, called abiogenesis. And there are several lines of scientific evidence that suggest plausible ways of how that might have happened.  Why can't Creationists get these details right?"
3666,"But...but...I just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the Ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. Now I'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.As to driving...don't care. What I'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. There's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. You saying they can't do that?"
3667,"A lot of the hoplophobes argue that the SKS is an  assault weapons . Yet the SKS has no pistol grip, no adjustable buttstock, no threaded muzzle, no flash suppressor, no bayonet lug, and no detachable magazine.  Basically these weapon-fearing paranoid nuts are stating what we've known all along:  Any gun is an assault weapon if we say it's one! It doesn't matter what features it has, we know better than anyone else! "
3668,"No. In 1996 there was a shooting massacre in Port Arthur, in the countries south. The new government had just been voted in, and it was their first act, right on the back of this massacre, to tighten gun laws up significantly. Riding on the back of public horror at the massacre, it was rushed through, approved by both the upper and lower houses, and made law."
3669,I'll let you know to what extent the movie documents it. I'm off to see it in a few. :)
3670,"I admit I didn't know who Sermonti was at first. A search on Wikipedia returned Ciacco, one of the characters of the Divine Comedy by Dante. a Google search led me to Giuseppe Sermonti who has written against evolution since 1980. He is known for expressing the need for 'purpose' to be part of science, giving such examples as:  In the presence of the inducer (lactose) the cell produces an enzyme with the purpose of utilizing lactose4).  In case you never took biochemistry, this is an incredibly well understood chemical process and requires no purpose beyond the interaction of well understood chemicals."
3671,"Besides being terribly wrong, that's not evolution and has nothing to do with evolution. Perhaps because you know so little about orbital physics you think that the sun rising and setting is any kind of evidence for the earth orbiting the sun. It isn't. You would have to actually understand a little about it to know that. Nobody, from Copernicus onward, used observations of the revolution of the earth to conclude that the earth was in orbit around the sun."
3672,"Ah the Accuracy International, a high quality, high cost precision weapon. Available in .308 Winchester, .338 Lapua, .300 Winchester Magnum, and 7mm Remington Magnum. Essentially nothing more than a common hunting rifle given a massive overhaul.  I don't know about that listed range, however. The maximum effective range listed is 800 meters. Then again that might be wrong and these short action calibers might have a 1,500 meter effective range, meaning that the claimed abilities of the .50 BMG are mediocre in comparison.  Hard to say really. The boxes of common .22 rimfire ammunition I get say that they're dangerous out past a mile, and that's a tiny little cartridge suited for vermin."
3673,Well the blame falls to the county for issuing illegal marriage licenses. Such is the price for acting outside the law.
3674,"Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief."
3675,"People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things."
3676,"They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken."
3677,"The 1860 Colt Navy Revolver is a .36 caliber single-action revolver, which means the hammer must be pulled back and released by the trigger for each firing.  It's what's termed a cap &amp; ball pistol, meaning a measure of gun powder is placed in each front opening (6) of a revolving cylinder with a normally round lead projectile 'ball' used to compress the powder. A 'cap' consisting of fine gunpowder encased in a tin cap is placed on a nipple at the rear of each cylinder opening. The revolver hammer is pulled back (cocked), trigger pulled which releases the hammer to fall and crush the cap, which creates a small explosion of fire directed by the nipple to the measure of gunpowder creating a larger explosion which propels the projectile (ball).  These are black powder guns, low velocity and a mess to clean after firing. Lots of websites on the history and and many, many excellent reproductions."

3683,"I think you're over-complicating the anti-choice position. A majority of anti-choice posts I've read are essentially based on their 2000 year-old mythical belief system, when women were not considered a particularly valuable portion of society for tasks other than child bearing and scullery purposes. Unless, of course, capable of immaculate conception, still unproven, yet enjoying dogmatic status. If you refute those mythical beliefs, regardless of any country's constitution, to those posters you're actually less than a piece of real estate and definitely non-human, male or female."

3698,I'm glad to see you've finally come around.
3699,"Well, stated that way, there is no problem with religion and evolution co-existing. Many evolutionary biologists are religious. Dr. Kenneth Miller of Brown U. is a practicing Christian and a respected evolutionary biologist. He engages in debates from time to time with creationists and ID proponents. There is little problem with the theories of evolution and most main-line religions around the world.The real debate is between a minority of United States fundamentalist christians and science in general. You have seen on this board that even though the theories of evolution are biological, several creationists have insisted that somehow there is a grand theory of evolution that includes the origin of the universe, the galaxies, the solar system, the planets, the earth, and life on earth. Typicaly, creationists claim that they don't oppose science but only evolution - and by that they mean cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary physics, biochemistry, geology, most of physics (relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, embryology (evo-devo), paleontology, paleoanthropology, and on and on. What is not opposed is trivial and limited that data upon which scientific theory is built, not the theories.So to answer the question can religion and evolution co-exist? Without question. Evolutionary scientists do not study matters outside the domain of science. Science is naturalistic - methodological naturalism - and cannot observe and study the supernatural. The supernatural cannot be quantified. I have yet to see an equation that represents the power of God. That is not to claim that things outside of science do not exist or are not valid and important. It is just that science is not the proper tool for the study of such matters. Questions of faith and morals fall in other domains - theology and religion, for example.Can creationism and science co-exist? Probably not. But the problem is not with science. It is with creationism. Creationism establishes its conclusions before any evidence is examined based on ""divine revelation."" The problem arises when science, without regard to religion, uses the scientific method to arrive at conclusions that cannot be reconciled with creationist conclusions. This makes science the evil work of Satan, and it means that scientists are trying to escape responsibility to a god based on primitive mythology."

3712,Who ever made such an argument?
3713,REALLY?  let me reword it for the simple people ...  If you are old enough to decide to die in the military for YOUR COUNTRY - you are old enough and mature enough to reasonably care for fire arms properly.  IF you can LEGALLY join the military (as in not a traitor or a criminal) you should ALSO be allowed to own any weapon you can personally purchase.

3716,Erector sets anyone?  I've never in 5 years on multiple boards seen a user able to hold his own in a science discussion with a theory that cannot be tested. I've however seen a pattern of deliberate ignoring of users who poke holes in their theories though. Apparently they'd rather ignore how they are wrong then fix their problems (yet they criticize the very nature of science).  People say that civilization has advanced. These people make me think long and hard about that.
3717,"Actually energy can be caused by matter. Newton's Theory of Gravitation shows that gravity is an effect of the presence of mass. The presence of a second mass within the gravitation field of the first mass gives the matter gravitational potential energy, which, without an opposite force to balance it, is converted into kinetic energy."
3718,"No, nothing to do with it. Economics is not the product of morality...the most you can say is that one system of economics will be more flexible with different morality systems. It would be hard to argue that capitalism isn't the system to best handle different moralities.  And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality."
3719,"I hate to break this to you but this is racked with illogic.  Well, ok it's  logical  but the premises rely on things that are pure assumptions.

3727,"Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)).  Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of OklahomaÃ•s Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (1998))."

My take: Mathis lied a lot."
3739,"That's a completely different argument, order does not imply a creator."
3740,"I would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. Second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. They have no buisness doing that."
3741,"Doesn't matter if they ""give it up"" or not. They don't legally issue death certificates for abortions. Imagine that. Death certificates are ONLY issued to once living persons. OH WAIT!!! I think we just proved that a ZEF is not a ""person"" emoticon_xgood"
3742,"He has a bit more basic information about R.A.T.E. on his webpage.TO also has a page critiquing R.A.T.E. methodology.Sorry, I know you're looking for more substantial personal feedback, but this is some good basic information that doesn't rely upon a billion links.You also might consider asking this question on iidb.org, and maybe Dr. Meert will respond to you personally.More importantly, let us not get hung up on analyzing the raw empirical data only. For example, if I use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for light to flood the room after I turn on the switch, and I come up with 0.06s, you can't argue with my empirical data: I timed it at 0.06s. The fact that human response time is comparatively lousy and that a stopwatch is awful for extremely short time intervals is more significant that the stopwatch reading itself. This is the primary error that R.A.T.E. makes."
3743,"Responsible contraceptive use is indeed less exciting of a topic to debate than abortion. The only debates that do occasionally arise occur when someone on the pro-life side suggests abstinence only education, and is then attacked by those on the left. I am glad to see that there are many on the pro-life side that agree that abstinence only education might not work. I genuinely believe that better sex education in the schools and a cultural stress at keeping sex safe would go a long way in reducing unwanted pregnancies. Now that AIDs is not as dangerous, it seems that there is less of a cultural push for safe sex than there used to be - since condoms preventing spread of AIDs could also prevent unwanted pregnancies.  Anyway, this topic will unfortunately likely die out. At least it was worth a try."
3744,"There is NO such thing as ""pro-abortion"" emoticon_rolleyes No one wants every single fetus to be removed. All the more reason why each individual should be able to decide what is best for them at the time they become pregnant.  emoticon_xbye"
3745,Are the commuters who deface or tear down the anti-abortion ads exercising their right to free speech and expression?
3746,"You're telling us we're soft on crime? You're the one who is portraying the two men who were shot as victims and dismissing their crimes.It's ironic, those two criminals who cross the border illegally with malevolent intentions, robbed a guys house, and were legally killed are poor, innocent victims, yet this 80 year old man who just tried to defend himself and didn't hurt anybody is a mothertrucking, baby-eating criminal who deserves to be locked up.You have such a distorted view of right and wrong, Brady."
3747,"The big bang theory actually describes the universe very well and is the best working model we have. No one has developed a complete model of the universe that can describe all observations. That doesn't make the model completely false, it just makes it incomplete.  Back in the day, Newtonian physics was dominant. Then came Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing), and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that. There are problems with General Relativity, which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe.  I'm going to say it again: the model isn't wrong, its incomplete. Models get replaced by better models that better fit our observations.  Big Bang merely describes the way the universe works, it doesn't make any predictions as to what was responsible for setting these events in motion."
3748,"You're obviously an Obama supporter, they're the only people who wouldn't be upset at his abusive tactics of threatening lawsuits against anyone that runs unfavorable ads against him, thus showing that he doesn't support the First Amendment."

3750,"Keeping porn legal and accessible on the internet, keep taxes high, keep abortion legal....keep people voting democrat. Send as many people to hell as possible."
3751,Yet another example of a court ramming gay marriage down the public's throats. I wonder how long it'll take DC to generate a ballot initiative to reverse the court?
3752,"But in both situations, there are things that an individual can do to reduce the risks of bad things happening. There are also things that cannot be done in either situation to completely eliminate risk. I already mentioned that there is a genetic component to heart disease. My entire point has essentially been that human beings don't always deal with risk in entirely realistic ways."
3753,"If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that."
3754,"Actually it is. All the countries with public healthcare systems rank higher than the U.S. We are number 37. I thought we already went through this.  Every scarce resource is rationed in every system. For example healthcare is rationed for the uninsured, the uninsurable, the dropped ones."
3755,"Here's a quote from mayr regarding selection,   Only relatively few individuals in a given generation would qaulify and survive the selection procedure. That small sample would be able to preserve only a small amount of the whole variance of the parental population. Such survival selection would be highly restrained.  What Evolution Is. pg. 118  So....do you evolutionists agree with this? Let's take humans. Are only a few people in this generation  fit  enough to go on to breed? Is Mayr smoking crack or what?????? This theory is pathetic."

But the child, whose life you ended before birth, you gave No-chance to; so what's this rationalization - only in 'your mind' - re ""a 2nd. chance to make it right""??See you recognized & admit caving-in to ""dumb peer pressure"" before then compounding acts of irresponsibility.But your mother:1. She was ""ashamed"" - was she selfishly more concerned with herself?, and what people would think of her?, and you? and the family? - so, let's just ""Quietly kill it""?and2. She was ""ready to kill me"" - right: 'Kill ! this! baby!, before I kill you' - type-thing. great; that's a *lesson for Pro-life* not! emoticonXBanghead So your mother failed the *both of you*, bigtime! - and while you can't change that part of your past,to a degree - much larger than you most likely realize, you are shaping your 2 current children's life. And from your rationalizations (about the baby you killed), the concern is that you  model soul/mindfully  for your children, good/honorable behavior.

3760,"With regard to this statement you have to consider:  1. How can anyone know what product an  intelligent designer  wanted.  2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.  But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants."
3761,"Let me get this straight. You are going on Plato saying that not beleiving in Zeus, Mars, Apollo, et al. is like a diease in the brain as supporting Christianity?"
3762,"And a lot of people are made uncomfortable by a presence of a mother breastfeeding her baby in public. You can't simply let standards of discomfort rule and guide the course of law. There's no constitutional or human right to be free of discomfort and not intimidated. If you're intimidated by somebody walking a large, powerful looking dog that could probably break your arm in its mouth, should we take steps to prevent such dogs from being owned, or walked in places where other people are present?I'm sure if you look you can find plenty of women who are uncomfortable in the presence of black men, for whatever reason. Should we take action to free them of their discomfort?"
3763,"Well, you have me there. I didn't do a statistical analysis, but I'm not a statistician either and couldn't perform an analysis even if there was enough data. However, if such an occurrence were probable, you'd think that scientists would have an easy time of producing the evidence."
3764,"wow, I never thought a qoute would be so stupid as to compare it to a house. Fine then what if I compare your head to a house that is housing ur brain. But it would be perfectly legal to rip it out and steamroll it on the street for allto see.(by ur rules of course this would be a perfectly acceptable thing to do)"
3765,"Because the 'founding fathers' were not as foolish and gullible as people like you (especially, in foreign countries) to believe that ANY form of government is above the possiblity of tyranny against it's citizens."
3766,Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
3767,"And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a ""high powered rifle"" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics."
3768,Intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle for everyone or for those who are married?
3769,"Only a fool would deny the validity of Geology in legitimate science. Just as only a fool would deny the bible answers our questions in spiritual matters, such as how did we get here. But to apply Geology to a false science such as evo is to corrupt it and will no doubt be proven to result in false conclussions ln many areas of its application.  So much for this thread that was started in order to bait and mock rather than seek to learn or actually teach anything."
3770,"I see that river runs wide and deep on the left bank, de Nile."
3771,"Being new isn't a problem. Nor is uncertainty about a position. The way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places. However, a problem with message boards is that, without experience, it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith."
3772,So there you have it: AMENDMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION.
3773,"The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it."

3776,"And you do what many atheists do when they donÂ’t know what else to say, you clang the fallacy bell."
3777,"So you condemn these people (the pro-lifers) for not helping, then acknoweldge that they can't actually go into the clinics to talk to them - you did say that one of your gripes was that where you work, you've never seen any pro-lifers offering any help. Now you know why."
3778,"Then surely you can see that happenstance origins taught in science classes on the level that it is today comes dangerously close to violating the establishment clause of the first amendment! Do we rectify that by attempting to eliminate happenstance origins from science class? Nooooo, we rectify it by allowing the proper amount of ID in science class to balance it!"
3779,"First of all, death penalty cases usually cost more than keeping a prisoner alive for his life. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=108&scid=7"
3780,"Demographics plays a role, but it does not explain away the whole shift in the numbers."
3781,"Evolution  Read slowly for comprehension.  Evidence from Living Organisms   If species change over time, then scientists should be able to cite examples showing that a group of living species may have come from a common ancestor. Let us examine one of many cases for which this seems to be true. Gracing the islands of Hawaii is a family of birds commonly called the Hawaiian honeycreepers. All Hawaiian honeycreepers have similarities in skeletal and muscle structure that indicate they are closely related. However, each of the Hawaiian honeycreeper species has a bill specialized for eating certain foods. Scientists suggest that all 23 honeycreeper species apparently arose from a single species that migrated to Hawaii.   Aren't these  new  parts?  http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Hawa...eycreepers.gif"
3782,So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
3783,"While Huntard is correct in stating that all species considered to be human walked upright, there are some humans alive today who do not.  Misconduct claim fuels dispute among ?wrist-walker? researchers"

3785,I just want to say that i am doing a paper for school also about abortion and until i came to this forum web site thing i didnt have enough information..  I just want to tell you thank you soooooo much jim's trucking for all those web sites you posted i know they were intedned for xbig_bootiex i just thought about checking them all out .... i cant thank you enough those web sites helped me out alot.. i dont know what i would do without this site literally once again thank you jim's trucking your an hehehehe
3786,"If anyone is pushing ID, YEC is an issue. ID as a ""foot in the door"" maneuver in an effort to teach science. The problem is that most school boards are made up of Christians who think that their religion is somehow supported by science, and they don't see the harm in teaching their idea of god as science. You seem to fit that picture pretty well."
3787,"Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton."
3788,"I'm sorry, but that's not what my version said.""No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the LORD ."" Emasculated = castrated Emasculation was not an accident. (What this verse has to do with the death penalty is beyond me.)"
3789,"Well said.  With this religion, the gap is very wide between the  average guy  and  authority , because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government."
3790,So it is perfectly legal to shoot someone whom you think might possibly attack you in the future with a gun...seems if anything it is far more like removing the guns from people who can't be trusted with them.
3791,"Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims.  PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful."
3792,Anti abortion people want to take a womens right to an abortion away period. Would you force someone to get a sonagram of a tumor and be forced to look at it and think  do I really want to have this tumor removed?  That is exactly what a fetus is and for some women that is how it is viewed.
3793,"Hey, dont give religion on public schools credit. At least crack tastes good."
3794,"You wanna compare foreign nations even though no two stats are comparable or similar? Fine, let's look at China and their rising gun crime."
3795,"A broken-down tv set is not a valid parallel. It doesn't reproduce, and there is only one of it. Life, on the other hand, does reproduce (at least some organisms do).  It would be interesting for someone to make a counter displaying the number of times natural selection needs to be explained to creationists.  Actually, that would be easy: infinity. They just don't get it."
3796,"I'm not sure what you're thanking Kronus for (or simone in post #3). All either has done is confirm that no, you can't prove god's non-existence. I infer from your gratitude that you feel that an inability to prove its non-existence makes some kind of point in favour of its existence: if so, think again. An inability to prove the non-existence of leprechauns does not make their existence any more likely either."
3797,"Still dumb to compare the two. Both are no good. Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.  Stoner is not good, alcoholic is not good, herion addict is not good. You ask if I have evidence...yes, my own two eyes. Don't believe me then so be it, but there are many articles that say the effects of marijuana...at the very least it is like smoking. I stress very least."
3798,"But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves. "
3799,"Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?"
3800,"Of course the other reason why pro-life people might oppose the  morning after pill  is that it is thought that one of the ways it works is by preventing the fertilized egg from attaching to the uterous, thus forcing the fertilized egg to be aborted..."

3802,"Actually he doesn't believe in a liar God like you, so really it's YOU who's the blasphemer. And he's a Christian, you're a Biblist. He actually follows Christ, you just try to maintain the credibility of your God-Book."
3803,"My GOD! anti gay or not, where's common decency?? My heart breaks for that poor family. I hope that hospital has to pay through the nose for what it did to those poor children, denying them the opportunity to see their dying parent. I really don't care what the politics are in that poor, backward state. there is simply no excuse for treating childen like that. Also, this is a hospital, and there was an accurate medical history available to them they did not avail themselves of. This is gross negligence!"

3808,"Good has nothing do with logic. Explain what good and logic have in common????  The Christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from God.  God is transcendent; that is, He is beyond the material universe being its creator.  God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature.  Therefore, the laws of logic are absolute.  The are absolute because there is an absolute God.  The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes, and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue."
3809,"SNIP  This opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an  assault weapons ban  because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier."
3810,I believe they got XXXXXX at all the conservates on this board. So they went and joined a commie discussion board where they feel more welcome and can send congrats to each other for being smarter than regular people.
3811,"Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory. Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved."
3812,"let me try to translate into words1. if there is a god in this world, there is a god in all worlds2. there being a god is a possibility3. If there's a god in all worlds, there's a god in this one4. There not being a god in all worlds implies that there's isn't a god in any world (all or nothing)5. There is either a god in all worlds or there isn't a god in all worlds6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world7. if there's no god in this world then there's not a god in all worlds8. There's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world.9. Since god is a possibility we know the statement <there is no god in any world> is false.10. Since there's a god in all worlds there's a god in this one from 3Is this the right interpretation? If it is there is one flaw in it. #9 is flawed. Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world."
3813,"That could certainly explain a lot of our erratic, short-term political goals.  I've always felt that cocaine, with its mind-boggling profit factors and volume, was never declared #1 during the crack era because the money was so big payoffs had infiltrated law enforcement and legislative areas in such high positions of power that it was downplayed as a problem of Columbia and Peru. So we send troops to Columbia for fulfilling political agendas, pack our prisons with addicts and low level dealers and chase pot growers while cocaine management, other than a couple of high-profile cartels who threatened our puppet in Columbia, remained virtually untouched."
3814,"It's true, I find the story on sites that are generally anti-bush. However, this was a radio show transcript, not a site.  Larry Flint says  'I've talked to the woman's friends,' Flynt said. 'I've tracked down the doctor who did the abortion, I tracked down the Bush people who arranged for the abortion,' Flynt said. 'I got the story nailed.  I haven't seen it either confirmed or denied by anyone more reputable."
3815,"I don't see how one can be a agnostic and be a Deist either. Deism requires a origin, some form of a clockmaker. To not be sure that such a being exists is to fail one of the most basic ideas of Deism."
3816,"While this is true, the number of abortions at or after 21 weeks is not insignificant. According to the Guttemacher Institute, 1.2% of abortions occur at or after 21 weeks. That translates into about 15,480 abortions. This thread, of course, is talking specifically about those 15,480 abortions."
3817,"Why should your belief of that being the case take precedent over the belief that that is not the case?  What gives you (or any group) the right to impose your views on other people, directly affecting their rights, simply for an idea you have of  ideals  that not eveybody agrees with?"
3818,So says the master of cherry picking.
3819,"Doesn't count. Took place in a ""gun free zone"". By law no guns are allowed there, so by law this incident couldn't take place."
3820,"I've not honestly watched it yet (have crappy internet connection at the moment, might watch when I go home from Uni), but it could be just die to stimulus/response or a pure reflex. The brain could easily not be involved and its unlikely to be aware of what its doing, if its not just another artefact of the speeding up the film (i.e being poked and moving due to being manipulated but seeming to struggle rather than being moved)  Pro-choice and developmental biologists are quite different, I'd be worried if you had none on the pro-life side of the debate yet all agree on the period of time it takes for certain structures to develop."

Even if dropped to 9 and 15, it's still 24 million less than Hillary and Company claim...making their 47 million lose weight down to 23."
3822,"Most of these ammendments were rushed in thier writing. They have all sorts of issues and problems. Most will be shot down in the courts with in the next year. Too Broad or cover more than one issue. Most will be found unconstitutional. They are just an obstacle, not the end of the war."

3824,"Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example."
3825,Why should we listen to you when you don't listen to us?
3826,No.  Try this: Object to blanket laws requiring a woman to remain pregnant without consideration for her personal circumstances.
3827,"Irrelevant. Even if we assume that accusations of religion's negative influence are misplaced, two wrongs don't make a right. Either Darwinism and social atrocities are related, or they are not. Frankly whether they are has nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is true or whether science expels dissenting opinion. The topic is completely tangential to the alleged point of the movie, which is because the movie is pure propaganda intended to dupe people like marc into thinking that these issues are topical.  The classic example is: gravity makes countless people fall to their deaths every year. This isn't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death; no, this is continual, yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community. This is because scientists are evil and out to destroy dissenters by letting gravity do the dirty work. We must dispel this mythical gravity idea as pseudoscience and replace it in schools with Intelligent Falling theory."

Clue: they're not above his waist."
3829,"From the data we have seen regarding crime trends in britian since the gun ban, the ONLY people who have benifited from that particular bit of legislation are the criminals.  Crime in britain has been on a steady rise since the ban was passed. They are even considering arming their police officers now. It seems logical that reversing that particular bit of ill concieved legislation would benifit ONLY law abiding citizens. THe criminals apparently have not obeyed the ban, they simpley get their weapons through other outlets. Recently they have started convrting starting pistols. In America, a converted startign pistol would be a pretty poor choice for a weapon, there is good chance you would be laughed at. Apparently in Britain, people are being terroriz4d by them/"
3830,There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.

3833,"Well, I am a creationist, and I would hope I can think logically (it's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have). The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple. In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it's environments. In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds. If this is possible I pose a few questions for you.1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it! That's a classical example of circular reasoning.I am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do. If you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1106ng.asp. This article also has many links to other articles with even more information."
3834,"And if people have a  religious belief  whereby they don't think blacks should vote, or that interracial marriage should occur, should governmental officials who have those  religious beliefs  just be allowed to ignore their duty?  What if I had a religious belief that prevented me from performing my governmental tasks for Christians? Should that be respected as well?  They are paid to do their job. People who get to pick and choose what their  job  should entail because of their religious beliefs should find another form of work.  If when I was in the military, I had suddenly stood up and said,  Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.   Should that be respected and I keep my  job ?"
3835,"I think VTs reason for posting that video was to show that this 12 year old girl has more wisdom regarding abortion, and sensitivity to human life than most adults possess today. And she rightfully pointed out the true and very real downsides of what abortions represent for the women who get them.

Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a  fully developed  one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were  totally useless , is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions."
3858,"So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.

Not sure where you stand on those issues - but I am a strong proponent of doing more of this as a way to address abortion. All kinds of energy goes into the legalities.

3880,"In fact, the period when theology was the ""queen of the sciences"" we generally refer to as the ""dark ages."" Science in the modern sense is only about 400 years old. You can get a hint of how the ""queen of the sciences"" operated by the fact that Copernicus (a priest) withheld publication of his heliocentric theory until he was quite certain that he was close to death; in fact, legend has it that he saw the first copy on the morning of his death. He knew what the consequences of his theory, that flew in the face of the geocentric dogma of the ""queen of the sciences"", would be. Giordano Bruno and Galileo both found out the consequences of stating theories that were in conflict with the ""queen of the sciences."" Only when science broke free of the domination by the Church were scientists free to follow the data to the conclusions rather than begin with the conclusions did real science develop and begin to develope real scientific theories. ""Creation science"" still begins with the conclusions and then tries to find data that will fit the dogma, even if it is sometimes contradictory. In ""creation science"" there is no hyopthesis, no prediction, and not test with the power to falsify the hypothesis. ""Creation science"" is pseudoscience."

If the reason a pharmacy kook is refusing service based on their belief that doing so is contrary to their religious beliefs (or that they are supporting a behavior that is considered bad in their religion), then is it not clearly illegal?The grey area is of course if they lie and say it's not religion, it's just ""ethics"", or ""whim"". In that case it may not be illegal, but if I got that in writing, that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim, it makes it easy to fire them since it's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons (race/religion/color, etc.)Up to the courts I suppose.

3900,"What you are talking about is irreducible complexity; it is the only argument against evolution that appears to be totally immune to rebuttal.I have thought this issue is far over debated like gay issues but perhaps that are because I have an objectivist view point. I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID.They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence, but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth, but it's also evidence for the earth spinning.Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement ""life forms are similar to other life forms"", This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well.Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology, direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation, it would have to be original useful DNA, or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination."
3901,"Yes they are mutually exclusive SD, or else God is a liar. Can't you see that? Tell me how God could have created the Heavens, the Earth and all life as described in Genesis less than 10,000 years ago, AND simultaneously allowed intelligent life to have evolved through random mutation by way of natural selection over a period of billions of years? Explain that massive inconsistency to me in a rational and consistent manner if you can.  The bottom line is that when all is said and done, either ID or evolution will be proven to be 100% wrong. And it won't matter to God at all if the other side is only partially right. But the side that's wrong has had to have erased Him from the equation in order to get to that fallacious conclusion, and that side is evolution which exists for the purpose of offering a secular humanist answer for how man came to be here."

It shows obvious similarities that are almost certainly not coincidencial.In part I, the fish and salamander look similar to everything else (note the curvature and the small flaps under the head).However, in parts II and III, the fish and salamander begin to look different.You can see where this is leading, right? It is leading to the assertion that these organisms are related, but that the fish and reptiles are not as closely related to the mammals as the mammals are related to each other.This assertion is also backed up by the fossil record, but that isn't as visible as this picture."

Or is this just your own personal belief?  The ultimate justification is that they're in place to keep the government at bay and in check through the various tools provided to us by the Founders who didn't want another King George running around.  That's like saying that if you can't prove an animal's existence then it obviously doesn't exist, even if it simply hasn't been discovered yet."

3913,"Though I am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning, I need to address yours points.I get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on - i.e. not only in late term. I would contest this. Up to around the beginning of the third trimester, the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with ""nobody home"" - i.e. no mental existence (no thoughts, no emotions, no sense of self, no feelings of pain, no ability to experience their environment - nothing). I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body. As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness, it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive. It is the person who effectively resides in the body (through mental brain function or belief in a soul) who we value - not the body itself. From discussions with those on the pro-life side, it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME. What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value. The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions, thoughts, feelings of pain, etc. Apparently, its value dropped significantly (at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question).However, once there is ""somebody home"" in that body, then I would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account. Biologically, neurologically speaking, such mental functions can't start before around the beginning of the third trimester. So, I support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions (mother's life, significant risk to health, mercy killing deformed fetuses, etc.). Then it makes sense to speak of an ""other"" to whom one has responsibilities.One last point. I have heard a few pro-life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro-choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a ""defense rationalization"", where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong. You don't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say. As a general rule of thumb, I tend to think that most people believe what they say. However, many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are. I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer. Where the pro-life camp is concerned, I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future. This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME, not for what it currently IS. As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason (note: they represent a minority of the pro-choice side), then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason.So, instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro-choice supporters, search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit. That would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt."
3914,"I'm not sure where anyone said it related to evolution, the big bang, etc., but I might have missed something."
3915,"Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"

Thus, the notion of all-powerfulness, which leads to such a notion, is also absurd."
3924,"Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from?

The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies."

3955,Really??? Maybe you should do a little research before you make sweeping statements like that. -- http://www.rainbowbaptists.org/
3956,But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought. I have read some discussion about various other possibilities. Maybe several forms of life arose in various environments. Eventually they then had to compete for resourses and all but one went extinct. And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population. The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms.
3957,"I believe that anyone should be able to choose death at any time. If a criminal asks for the death penalty, give them a psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental state.

As I said, only humanity has evolved past having to survive in the natural World as all other animals on Earth do."
3959,The law doesn't provide for that. It's a pay as you go proposition. It's actually even worse than some people think it is. It is not actually necessary to have actual intercourse to bring about pregnancy. But the DNA donor will still have to pay the piper. That's the law.
3960,"Entirely wrong on this point. I was in sierra leone during hte rebellion, nad they did have a working government structure from begining to end. Civilians in rebel controlled portions of sierra leone were hacked apart with machetes (literally) and horribly treated because they had no way to fight back. In several circumstances, entire villages were bypassed by the rebels becasue one or 2 people had ignored the ban on guns. Rebels showed up, took fire from the town, and went and found an easier town to pick on. There was a move by certain british folks who worked for certain british companies to arm the civilian population. Unfortunatly, the UN impoased an arms embargo against sierra leone and short circuited the plan."
3961,"I know what you meant.  My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.  Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.  By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.  In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.  The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.  By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?  If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply  vote  it out of existence. No need for the courts at all."
3962,"I think it could impact the health of the man. Seems you are downplaying the role of a man in a childs life. For shame!  I don't know how you could say the two aren't comparable. You argument is that the mother shouldn't have to support someone that she doesn't wish to support. You are now trying to qualify it by saying a mothers health is the main concern because health is more important than money. So your standard seems to be  If the human is being supported by another and may adversly hurt someones health than there should be a choice. Otherwise we can restrict choice.  Ok, what if child support will cause the man to have to eat worse or work more and thus hurting his health? Does this not qualify now? The man 1) didn't have a choice and 2) has his health adversly affected.  Looks to me like you just have a double standard."

3965,how is disproving the best explanation scientists can come up with for the diversity of life without divine intervention not an argument for divine intervention?

3967,"I find the neo-marxist approach to political science interesting and useful. Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful. Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces. This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute, efficiency. There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them. How do you feel about marxism, socialism and communism, and why?"

But a parasite is considered a living parasite when it is sucking on your blood . An unborn can be using the mothers resources but still be a life. A human life.  Keep in mind this post is about when is a person a person...So keep it on track with when is a life a life."
3970,"I know that also. But it still doesn&#8217;t say when a fetus becomes a human being. If God knew him two weeks before he was born, he would have known him in the womb. But for 8 1/2 months he wouldn&#8217;t have know him."

3974,"So sex is only a privelage for those who can phisically give birth? Abortion is not Black and White as you are trying to paint it to be. It's much more complicated. Having a baby, even giving it up, causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain, and most people just cant have babys. They cannot care for it, and they cannot bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere. As I have said before, this is much more complicated than you think. Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester, so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they cannot support a baby.This is an interesting article:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/I would suggest reading it, just to get a better Idea of our position."

It's exactly that kind of comment that makes people with a smattering of scientific education say 'go read a book on biology before you say that dogs evolved into humans'.Humans did not evolve from dogs and ToE has never suggested that this is so.

3992,It did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. Nobody knew the mechanism till that era. And of course HGT is just another form of variability to be taken into account.
3993,"You actually think Evolution works by what creatuers  want ? You think they just got up one day and said, ""ya know Bob, I wanna evolve."" !!Oops, there goes my tail!!One want an organism can change is due to being in a different environment, isolated from the previous group. Mutations can occur, and if they aren't killer, they are passed on. Changes in genetic material through mutation add to the gene pool and are passed on through mating.If you are an isolated group of animals, and you have enough mutations and mating, you will change over time. The environment, through one process, can choose who succeeds and who doesn't. It's natural selection. There are other mechanisms, of course, so that's not the only one.We already know that Human brain development could possible have occured due to a new diet, in a new area. Meat allowed for a larget brain, which in turn allowed for better skills, compared to other animals. Humans used tools as well, which was aided by using hands. Eventually, these animals descended from the trees and ceased to be arboreal creatures, because they needed to use their hands for tools. You can't do that that well if you are swining in a tree."
3994,"What is information? Natural selection is one of the most important mechanisms of evolution. You see, there is no requirement in evolutionary theory that there be an increase in information. Someone lied to you and you didn't know enough to realize it. You just took it because it is what you wanted to hear."
3995,"But the Court went further than necessary. They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the ""right to abortion"" ON DEMAND at any time. That was an exercise in judicial activism. They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied. It's not the Court's function to legislate from the bench. It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus' rights are protected."

3998,"I think Carlene is referring more to the 'implanting a fertile embryo/zygote into the uterus' IVF version rather than just using donated sperm cells. So essentially the various healthy sperm are selected and incubated with healthy eggs (so you have selected them to avoid a birth defect, or because most of the eggs are unviable and you are using a donor one), a selection of viable embryos are then given the chance to implant themselves in the woman's uterus.The process involves a lot of zygotes being created, many of which will be unviable and a lot may have been able to develop properly but seeing as usually only one will implant they end up wasted. I can see pro-lifers objecting to the slightly wasteful technique (with some just discarded and not even given the chance to develop) but I think in this situation you can't really complain about the ones which didn't implant - seeing as this happens often enough in normal people, and may have been the reason the couple went after IVF in the first place.Might be wrong, but in short I think she means IVF rather than artificial insemination. I'd also like to hear the reasoning if it is actually insemination though."

Just out of personal interest lets say you took away the rights of the law abiding to own guns how would that shooting be stopped, cus i am pretty sure the drug dealing criminal would still get his gun Illegally. A gunner you say went on a massacre? I am pretty sure you mean a criminal went on a massacre and maybe if somebody like Doc or Old sarge was there the end death tally would have been alot different."
4009,"Well, I'm not sure the principles of physics and such would be any different - surely God could make them the way they are now and suspend them at will.That said, it seems reasonable, from a biological/geological perspective, that the following observations would be made:1. There would be a single mass extinction event for ALL flora and fauna, not numerous, asynchronous extinctions in differing environments encompassing particular groups of creatures2. This mass extinction would coincide with a single, large, relatively uniform stratum of a more or less heterogeneous composition, or perhaps a very few strata still with the same basic property, not numerous discontinuous strata3. there would be numerous complete fossils of all creatures living at the time, to include soft-bodied creatures (since rapid burial followed by fossilization is much more likely to preserve soft tissues either via imprints or actual fossilization)4. the complete fossils should all be found in contemporaneous strata, i.e., human fossils should be found in the same layers as dinosaurs5. The biological species concept should be very simple to define, as all living (and extinct) creatures would be, first of all, much less diverse, and each 'kind' would be simple to classify6. there would be no reason to find, or even to expect to find, a unity of basic forms or functions or genomic content in extant creatures (e.g., no 'universal' genetic code, mammals with more or less than 4 limbs, etc.)Well, that is a few off the top of my head..."

I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?  Likely, the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen. Other inert gases could have done the same."

Harry Potter is about witchcraft like Star Wars is about NASA. This is the same silly as those who fretted over the DaVinci Code. It's FICTION.  By the way you spelled  jerks  wrong.

Rom 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;  ...which suggests that Paul considered Jesus' conception to be fairly routine. EZ, evidence contained within the NT points to a gradual evolution of Christology over a considerable period of time."

4019,"This is not a part of the argument, though. Whether or not the woman can or cannot perform activities she wishes to do (which is not the case in pregnancy, btw, or at least varies greatly according to the individual) is irrelevant; it deals with the moral question of disconnecting someone who will die if they are not connected with you. The argument is equally applicable no matter the womanÂ’s mobility."

You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is."

The USA was the very FRIST government ever to be rulled by common and free men. When the USA first had the vote, Europe still had kings and emperors. Europe has become more like the USA and needs to work harder to become more like the USA. The USA had true freedom for more than 100 years before Europe started to get rid of their kings. In a few European countries they still have thier kings. I do not want to see a return of kings the the USA. Europe is almost like the USA, they just need to try a little harder."

4032,"Ah, I see.Your reasons are secret reasons. On a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! Nice debate.Who's really playing the game here?I have already listed on a number of posts why it's not constitutional.Since you missed it (It's only the first post in the thread)For gay coupes right to be married (Or the same legal status)1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender.2. It's a contract between two consenting adults.3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare.It's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights (hetero couples only), and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers. It's now a public issue on a significant scale.Of course, maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage, we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim, but why your reason is also not constitutional.You can call it games, I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights, such as yourself, really can't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights, other than saying ""well I want to""...or in your case... ""shhh...it's a secret"".You know what WE call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments? Losing the debate. I realize winning and losing..i.e. being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion, where anything goes...but out here in the real world actions have consequences, and words...yes, imagine that, have specific meanings. You verbally support a movement that restricts human rights, yet won't give us reasons for your position. I find that appalling. Yet you are content with labeling me as ""playing games"".

I haven't read from all sides, however."
4036,Yes but if you try to change it to something unrealistic it will not work and we end up with a lot of unwanted children who are very likely to grow up with serious problems.  I can?t think of anything sadder and more immoral then a policy that creates unwanted children as a side effect.  The religious are so worried about the period of time the child is basically not sentient and will make suffer those who are developed enough to actually be sentient all for the luxury of indulging their silly counter productive religious beliefs.

First you claim that the entire forelimb would have been useless, and when shown that it was not you claim that the feathers could not have existed because they would be useless, and now when shown a fossil that shows feathers, you are surprised that there are not more.I suspect that not all of the feathers on this creature are apparent in the fossil.http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather5.jpg http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather9a.jpg http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather11.jpg But there are enough to show that feathered dinosaurs did, in fact exist. Any argument about whether or not is is possible that such creatures existed is moot. It is irrelevant that you feel that such limbs would have been useless.

Besides, as I mentioned, Feduccia has just published a detailed study on the embryology of bird digits. It supports his view, of course. I don't have a problem with that and it is certainly an issue worth study. My days of ornithology and embryology were long ago.  Also, since those papers were published there have been several more feathered dinosaurs and primative birds discovered. Things are moving fast right now. Jeff Polling also has some information about the Ruben et al. article.  But the  bird hip/lizard hip  bit is pure nonsense that demonstrates profound ignorance or intentional deceit. The correct information is so easy to find. That sort of conduct certainly casts a bad light on creationism."

The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks."

I was engaged via private message on another forum by a user (who regularly boasted of his recreational drug use) who insisted guns were bad. When challenged with stats from the British Home Office (the person in question was a Briton) he replied something along the lines of 'Well, I don't care any more'. Which I considered odd, as it was he who initiated the debate. Given that, and other comments during our brief correspondence, I concluded that he could not reconcile the stats with his stance (the fact that rape, homicide, violent assault and theft all increased while rates of firearm ownership decreased, and the police themselves were dis-armed) and simply refused to admit his position may have been poorly informed."
4065,"So then the anti abortionists POV should, in your opinion, overrides the POV of the woman that the issue concerns? Why is it that to you the religious belief of the anti abortionist is more important then the body of the woman? The fetus is a parasite on the woman, just as a tape worm is. Are you then saying that if the cult of the tape worm arises, then their religious belief should then be forced upon those who suffer from tape worms.Yes I know there is a difference between fetuses and tape worms but the principle is the same. Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body?"
4066,"Oh, and I found this from here:  http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.   It appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. And the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence.

4072,"I find the neo-marxist approach to political science interesting and useful. Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.  I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful. Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.  I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)  I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.  I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces. This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute, efficiency.  There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them. How do you feel about marxism, socialism and communism, and why?"
