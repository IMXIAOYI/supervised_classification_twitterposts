0	Actually I'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway.   Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from "righteous" to bitter.
1	And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world.
1	So why is it a white man can't just think himself black, or vice versa?
1	Given your very poor English (spelling, punctuation and basic sentence structure), I think the assumption that anyone can understand 'exactly what you are saying' is a very poor one.SmileyPS I have highlighted some of the errors in latest attempt.
0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).
0	what the "eff" are you talking about?! wrong thread buddy.
0	What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said. Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not.
1	Such as what? It is not like putting two electrodes into the Earth and getting a measurement on some sort of gadget. The only way to measure how old something is, is by using a set of arbitrary assumptions. There are few things that you need to take into account, such as the rate of decay, and so on.Creationists know that there is something seriously wrong with the radio-metric dating methods. Explain this then, carbon dating of wood under lava that was erupted from Rangitoto (an island volcano near Auckland, NZ) indicates that the erruption was around 200 years ago (the name is said to mean "Red Sky", suggesting that the Maoris, who have been their for 1000 years at the most, witnessed this event). Yet potassium-argon dating of the lava rock has given ages of up to half a million years old! Now this alone is a big flaw. Any person who uses their logic can tell that the result of the potassium-argon is way out, it should be less than 200 years. The radio-carbon date is only restricted to thousands of years, because even after several hundreds of thousands of years, there will be no more radio-carbon left.The above came from Snelling, A., "Dating Dilemma: Fossil wood in "ancient" sandstone", Creation  21(3):39-41.Creationists don't have (by their own admissions) all of the answers when it comes to radio-metric dating methods, but they can see enough that there is something seriously wrong with the underlying assumptions. Professor Richard Mauger says: "In general, dates in the "correct ball park" are assumed to be correct and are published, but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepencies fuly explained."
1	I know..... I've wondered from time to time exactly what this improbability is. I mean most of us would find the probabilities of dealing a given sequence from a deck of 52 card pretty "improbable". I guess its best to avoid those tricky fact things and stick to words only.
1	http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/jones.aspWhen Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools, could it be that he "hardly knew the field, and didn't have an answer" that would fit the time constraints of his decision making? Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago? Why can't today's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago, and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas? Maybe because human nature doesn't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first.
0	Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had. 
0	as far as all observable evidence dictates, the laws of nature are what sustains the universe. there is not one single function of nature that isnt on "autopilot" as it were. that is, no function needed to sustain the universe occurs outside of natural law. what's more, nothing that defies natural law (whether universe-sustaining or not) ever occurs in observable realityI'm glad you responded Nu Leader. this is this issue that really hits the religion/science divide. as it is, God has been gradually and subliminally coralled in the spiritual realm. there is absolutely nothing in the physical and observable world that is a function of God, or a manifestation of supernatural power. in other words, in the realm of the physical, God has no turf. even if God does exist, he does not (and by biblical definition, cannot) physically manifest his being nor the effect of his powerthis leaves us with the spiritual realm. this realm, whether it exists or not, does affect people. yet this realm is as elusive and intangible as God himself. the same realm that God is believed to abive and reign in, is said to be the same realm that humans enter only when they die. i have many thoughts about the effects of this spiritual realm on reality, but for now i think its sufficient to say that God is limited to the spiritual realm only
0	So we agree..... What I want to know is why the vocal homosexual 'lobby' insists on the term  marriage?   emclean, the sanctity of marriage would not be the only thing about marriage to be (harmed?) changed. The whole definition of marriage would change, too.
1	That definition isn't what I'm disagreeing with :) I'm just pointing out why it's not happening here.Retroviruses, as I said, open up some very interesting possibilities. I'm not aware of any conclusive research taking place - I know the immune system makes use of them but I don't think there's any evidence of immunity being passed down in that way: early mothers' milk is the mechanism for that (packed with a payload of antibodies to prime the infant's immune system).To be honest, I think the existence of that system rather stomps on the plausibility of Lamarckian inheritance; why bother going to all that trouble if the parent could simply code immunity into the genes it passes to its offspring?
0	You just don't get it. Americans are freemen. Your faith in governments over people is humorous... How does it fell to lick the bootheels of your government overlords..... Rights are inalienable to man. One man has NO right to intefere with another man. I should be able to do as I please as long as I do not intefere with others... How does your government feel about that?
1	You know what the funny thing is about all of the "links" that they have found between ape and man? I could easily find people today that look exactly like the "links" that scientists have found. Maybe you should try picking one "link" from the site that you gave me. I could give you creationist sites, but that wouldn't prove anything more than your site proved. Here's an alternative theory: creation by God.

1	Sarah Brady is a straw purchaser then. She knowingly broke the law by buying a gun for somebody else instead of letting them go through the NICS check system. Who knows what else she's done and who she's supplied guns to.
1	Wait on, we are confusing our history here.Catholic Church was a branch of The Church, along with the then Byzantine Orthodox domonination.The Great Schism was between the Roman Catholic Church of the Papacy and the Orthodox Church of the Byzantine Empire. It took place in 1054 when the then Pope excommunicated the Byzantine Emperor from the Church (who, not to be out done responded with his own excommunication of the Pope).They might of patched it up had it not been for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade initiated by Pope Innocent II. Oooops!The Protestant Church was formed by Henry VIII when he declared himself head of the Church in England in 1534 in place of the Pope by the Act of Supremacy, so he could divorce and marry as nescessary. He never did get a fit male heir though.....
0	Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional.
1	This is why arguments like  well, our population is out of control  never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying  Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!  I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better.
0	But you're missing one important fact. NONE of those "reasons" are required for marriage. Absolutely none of them. Any combination of man/woman can marry for whatever reason they want. Even if it's just drunken fun.
0	Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get.

Anyone who doesn't like insurance premiums is free not to pay them, at least until the gov't takes over.  Happy New Year
1	The war isn't the reason banks shelled out millions of dollars to people who could never repay it. All that money came from somewhere, like corporations that expected to see a return on their investments. They got nothing, they laid off people as a result, which lead to the rates of unemployment and the housing fiasco.
0	Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?  Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.  Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?
1	This is a false dichotomy. We are limited by the English language on this subject as "beginning", "before" etc all reference time. Time is just a dimension of space-time however, thus something could have existed "before" (in a non-time sense) the beginning of space-time. So we might have had an absolute beginning, a partial beginning, or no beginning.
0	** Back to the dark side,eh, and 'argument by personal attack upon the character of your opponent'?
1	Whether Darwin did or didn't reason this (and he didn't) is irrelevant; the fact remains that the evidence supports evolution.
0	But the question is Can you prove your belief system is true? And all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. And ask yourself this. If the idea of God is such a man made plague, then God doesn't even exist right ? So if God doesn't exist then what has He done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? Why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? I challenge you to come up with a rational answer.
1	You didn't bother to read the link, I see, which said:"During the 70-year Babylonian captivity, from 606-537 B.C., the southern kingdom of Israel, Judah, had lost it's national sovereignty, but retained it's tribal staff or national identity.2 It is very significant that in the book of Ezra we read that during the 70-year Babylonian captivity the Jews still retained their own lawgivers or judges.3 The Jews maintained their identity and judicial authority over their own people even during 70 years of slavery. The scepter had not been lost during the Babylonian captivity."
1	But you are forgetting life-without-parole (and I do mean WITHOUT parole). With life without parole, there is also no recidivism.
1	But if the state refuses to recognise their right to commit to each other in a legal union, then they are being denied at least one right which is available to everyone else.  This can also affect legal entitlements.  Leo

1	A belief in Adam and Eve is a fundamental necessity to being a Christian at all. Jesus Christ believed in Adam and Eve, after all He created them.Gen 5:2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. [Adam means man]These arevthe words of Jesus Christ. You will notice He refers to the Old Testement as History.Mat 19:4  And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, Mat 19:5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Mat 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. Mat 19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? Mat 19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Joh 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God. Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. Joh 1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. Joh 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. Joh 1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. Joh 1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. Joh 1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. Joh 1:9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. Joh 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. Hitler said it was necessary to attack America because the best aryan stock had already moved here and would evolve into the master race.
0	Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.
1	When treating a woman, her situation is taken into account instead of a black-and-white  Its a life must protect  attitude. It seems more compassionate to consider the situation of the patient, instead of making arbitrary rules.
0	This is what socially inept losers do when they know their argument is ####, deny they ever made one.I've asked repeatedly for an example of the evolution of a new body part in a population and all you've done is confirm the fact that you're an absolute #####.
0	Archangel is right on this one. It's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person.  It does no service to the pro-choice lobby to display the sort of attitude that says  we don't value human life . If you think abortion is an acceptable moral choice then you have to make a case either that the fetus is not human, is not an individual, is not alive, or is in some other way not worthy of respect. Or you have to make a case that ending it's life is in some way justifiable in spite of these things.  I am pro-choice, but only because I don't believe you can legislate about an issue like this unless there is near unanimity. The suffering and anguish caused by banning abortion is substantial and should not be dismissed, but equally when abortion is legal it should not be seen as a substitute for contraception. How to achieve this is a difficult one, without causing psychological harm to women who feel they must make that choice.
1	Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference.
1	That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod.
0	Well, that aughta shut you up, eh Hank? LOL! :p Way to disprove the virgin birth, IMRAHIL. Of course neither the virgin birth story or the creation story are true. If a similar occurance were to happen today, the same ppl who believe it could have happened in antiquity would consider it ridiculous, and scrutinize the occurance to a degree they would never question their dogma.
0	That is the point. They are not neighbors, there are in a relationship and would get married if they could. I know my partner and I would! But despite your fancy wording they did stop Gay Partner Benefits. Hundreds lost there healthcare, now those people will take their tax money and leave Va. most likely to go to Mass. where they can have healthcare. And those in Mass who disagree with gay marriage may move to Va. Again, soon we will be a divided nation.
1	This argument is self-defeating. A theory is not a fact, no matter how much evidence may support the theory. Bad wording. But again, if you claim something as a fact, you must have proof, verified in both your method of reasoning, and the reasoning utilized by the person you are proving the fact to.
1	Wonderful News. Nice to see that at least some of the states here in the US have some common sense and are at least heading towards equality for gay couples. Good to hear about Oregon joining in soon.
0	You keep starting all these threads on gays, that&#8217;s called obsession.
0	Because those who are pro life are against a womens right to own her own body. Her body her choice and none of anyone elses business. Remember control freaks are everywhere.

0	How would you know about who winds up dead more? You don't prove anything either.
0	Then why are you and other "antis" so hung up on preserving it for your exclusive use?
0	It comes down to two groups  1 religious groups that believe that their religious freedom is more important then gay peoples religious freedom, that their religious freedom is more important then the safety and protection of gay families. That their religious beliefs and freedom is more important then gay equality and civil rights.  2 Heteros that believe that gay people are sick, diseased, less then human, and that their family structure is the only one that should exist.  In both cases groups that have a sense that they are privleged and their privlege is more important then the rights and lives of gay people.
1	So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.
1	Note the operative word is particular. The point being there are a miriad of people who can take on the responsibility of a born child. That is not the case in pregnancy.
1	Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings.
0	Because of your question " What is your definition of pure", I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense.
1	Problem is, the child support isn't owed to the woman but the child. Before abortion, the child cannot claim any rights on anyone as it is not accepted as a person. Afterwards, it is a different issue.  On the other hand: if a woman raped a man and had children, would he be expected to pay support: I suspect not. There was a recent case where a woman gave a man a blowjob and then impregnated herself with the semen. Her suit for child support was rejected on the grounds that there was no way he could have expected birth to be the outcome.
0	Only if we come up with some reason to keep bumping it...  Maybe we can paste a linked quote every time the claim is yet again uttered? Technically, it's relevant and on topic...
1	Actually they are what make us animals. It's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human.  There is no precise definition as to what it is that makes someone a person. An in-fetu fetus are not a person IMO even though they may well have a brain, nervous system and organs.
1	But the point you miss is that a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly; a puppy is NOT a full grown dog; a ZYGOTE and a FETUS are NOT children.  These entities have not YET grown or developed or changed into those other entities.
0	In the word's of Marilyn   We, the people of the United States, in order that we shall have the right to preserve a State free for all races, shall achieve this end by the use of non-lethal weaponry only for our continued survival as human beings. This free State entails our personal self-defense as well as our right to our food consumption. In keeping with current government law, if we so choose to possess a non-lethal weapon (be it either upon our persons or within our private homes), we are obligated to store these aforementioned weapons plus any ammo relating to its use in a manner which will serve to protect the welfare of a minor child. To further secure our persons, we have the right to wear bullet-proof body armour, plus live in bullet-proof houses as well as drive bullet-proof vehicles.   Umm... Well.

1	I think that you should check with cosmologists, astrophysicists, astronomers and the like to see why most scientists accept the findings of those sciences, even evolutionists. I suggest you read some books.The Whole Shebang: A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report by Timothy Ferris, emeritus professsor at UC Berkeley. A really good writer, Ferris has taught courses in journalism and science writing, as well as english, philosophy, and astronomy - a total of 5 diciplines at 4 universities.Other books that may help you to understand the topic are:Wrinkles in Time by George Smoot and Keay Davidson. The book is a report on the COBE experiments that verified the predicted unevenness of the background radiation. A good explanation of cosmology in general.The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene. These books require some scientific savy, so they may be a bit too difficult for you.

0	Well, 'convenience' is a debatable word here - its convenient for you to let a great number of people in Africa die because you want a TV, or electricity or a holiday, whilst its far less convenient for someone to have to carry a child. They will actually phsyically suffer whilst you just don't get the latest in modern western luxuries. Abortion as a means of birth control is just not a good idea though. 
0	Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies. Bush has reduced access to b/c (including e/c). A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush.
1	Indeed. Cobb County Georgia. And the sticker was found unconstitutional in Federal Court. The problem was that it was religiously motivated, was placed only in biology texts, didn't say anything true that the teachers weren't already teaching, and actually was not accurate. The sticker was found to be unconstitutional because it violated the second prong of the Lemon Test. I suspect that you don't know what that is. Anyway, the 11th Circuit reversed.

1	Radiocarbon is nevr used for 'millions of years'. It's used to measure human developments.  I suggest you read this.  Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.  This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another. In the process the paper refutes a number of misconceptions prevalent among Christians today. This paper is available on the web via the American Scientific Affiliation and related sites to promote greater understanding and wisdom on this issue, particularly within the Christian community.
1	Just by being something man made, this cannot be a right. Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God. For example, life, liberty, and property. I understand that many people do not have health insurance. It sucks, and everyone knows it. It is not a right, it is a good. Goods can be purchased in a competitive market priced based on the law of supply and demand, well in our capitalist society. This is an expensive good, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have it. That is just the way it goes, there are ways to fix it, there are ways to make it cost less, but not everyone is going to get it no matter how hard we try. Unless, God makes it a right, it is not one.
0	George Bush won the majority of votes (the first majority winner in 16 years) in an election with the highest turnout in US history (>117Million voters). The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody. Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate, something that never happens in a Presidential election year. This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control.  11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins. If liberalism ISN'T dead, then it's in ICU on a heart and lung machine.

1	I know very little about evolution, but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes, so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape. Instead, I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor, but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago.  Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me, since I said, I am by no means an expert on evolution.
0	I believe Jesus is a role model for the human race. I believe he is a very powerful idea. But what I do NOT believe is that there was some dude with a beard running around Israel healing the blind and preaching about his God. So, in a sense, I don't believe Jesus was a literal person in the ancient world, but more of a fable. Like Harry Potter is today.

1	Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I don't agree with this. I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena, only speculations as to what (if anything) may have happened before the Big Bang. If anything did (eg previous Big Crunch) that is not outside time, that is only time that is inaccessible to us in terms of observation. 
0	I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.
1	And just how does your description differ from materialism not one bloody jot - unless you intend to admit of supernatural hypotheses which are untestable empirically. Does your version of  science  admit of non-physical, non-material expalations. If so tis not science ore even  science  its pseudscience or superstition or worse.
1	No!  At conception we are a person and human.  All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.  A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.  The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.  The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.

1	Actually, I don't remember that they did. What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe. As I recall, most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so. So now, besides their other so called 'peer reviewed' magazine, they want to pretend that they are doing science here.

0	SP: Hello again. I hope you are well. God is difficult to define. One would not expect a finite being such as myself to define clearly and completely an infinite being such as God. However, as with any person God has defined himself. We all definie or identify, ourselves by various methods. What we like and dislike. What we do, where we go, where we have been. God has done this as well in the bible. He has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes (The ten commandments for instance). He tells what he does (he is a creator for instance, He loves, he has mercy and grace.) He tells us where he has been (He is the God that is, was, and will be, in otherwords exists outside of time).There are other things naturally. I can tell you some because as a finite being I will take a life time getting to know him. This is true with any person. You cannot completely define your closest and dearest friend. It is impossible because people are infinitely complex. You can know your friend none the less. This is true of God as well. You have heard me talk about God on this forum for quite sometime. This is how God is defined. You ask an impossibly broad question. Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they don't know. I know some not all. So do you. This is right. To assume that we should be able to define God completely and accurately is illogical.
1	So why cannot juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis? Under the theory of variable neurophysiological development, we could suppose that some individuals under 18 will have a fully developed moral understanding, and also some individuals 18 and over who do not.
1	Many Atheists I have encountered call God a human effort in wish fullfillment.THat seeking God and salvation through Jesus Christ is an illusion.Many of these folks are quoting Freud whether they know it or not.Ha! In the end, he was a Theist!
1	But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.
1	Yes, it happened through mutation. What do you mean by "what sort"? I assume you're looking for something more in depth than "the genetic sort". I'm afraid I can't rattle off the difference in the sequences if that's what you want. If that's not what you want than you'll have to ask a more specific question.

0	But why did you fear them, JP? Because they would discipline you? That's my case...and, so far, I guess I'm the only one that voted that way about God.  Some folks see God as a smiling XXXXX, skipping around throwing little flowers all about while we make wrong choices, sink deeper in sin, and try to cover ourselves in a blanket of self-righteousness.
1	Actually they already tried, see my previous posts. The city council rejected their ballot initiative petitions. Fortunatly for the people, half of the city council is up for re-election this year. Expect to see some new faces on the council.
1	You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.  The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable. The promised veto threat didn't matter in this instance. He was  standing on principle.  Well, same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view.

0	IMO, that's beside the point. The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people. Sure, people may still oppose gay marriage even if it's done legislatively as opposed to judicially, but at least then they'd have the chance and opportunity to do so. With only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important. So I think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat. Of course you feel they shouldn't have a say, so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat.
0	Well, you are apparently admitting that I am correct in that we do not know for sure. What God has to do with it I do not know, because I did not bring that side of the debate up. My argument is purely of logic and philosophy.Consider for a second that you are wrong, and that abortion really is the killing of thousands and thousands of people. Then is abortion a woman's right? Of course not. No one has the right to take a life for the sake of convenience (I'm not talking about aborting because the mother's life is at stake, for now just clear-cut convenience). So you commit a logical fallacy by assuming women have this right, because you assume that people are not being killed, while you provide zero hard evidence that this is the case. So, once again you are risking thousands and thousands of lives based on a hope.
1	That is so non-specific as to be nonsense. How is that comment relevant to any discussion that has gone before? Who has ever claimed that body parts are made up by placing one gene on top of another. I suspect that the remark is the direct result of your ignorance of the topic.
1	Tell me, how does a link to a religious nut who thinks the New Testament was first written in Aremic , despite tons of evidence to the contrary, have anything to do with refuting the scientific theory of evolution?
1	Actually, evolution occurs on the level of the population: individuals don't change, but populations do. See the examples above.

God has lifted his protecting hand because of my letter.But seriously, 3 people I ran into today told me they saw it. Two were people at work: one just said she read it without saying how she felt about it, the other went a bit farther to say that it really didn't offend her. But if you think about it, just her comment indicates that she felt that the way most people would respond would be negatively. The other person was my dentist, who I just happened to have an appointment with today. He starting talking at great length about Hugh Ross, and Gerald Shroeder, and how his own personal faith in Jesus and science get along just fine. I listened for about 15 minutes, only saying a few things now and then. And when I did, I didn't argue against his position ... I just pointed out that people really have to accept that evolution is true and that the Earth is billions of years old, which he had already said he accepted.

1	I may want to give a quick reminder that the bible was written by human beings, not a supernatural entity or Jesus. It is very unlikely that Jesus or God had anything to do with the bible, since the bible is not a very righteous, and preaches much hate. People who truely believe in doing good in the world and being followers of God would not even glance at this 2000 year old abomination.
1	--------At first glance this statute seems to merely track the now-expired federal AW ban, and I would watch out to see if its supporters are selling it as such. It is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban! I don’t know if it is being sold as merely a “common sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us,” but if it is, then here is why that argument is fraudulent: The old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an AW (in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an AW) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features, while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature. That is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms than the old federal ban. It looks like the old federal ban definitions were used as a template for this new statute, but whoever wrote it decided to change it down to 1 offending cosmetic feature knowing full well it would ban far more firearms. If I were you I would let my legislator know this difference. For comparison, here are the AW definitions from the old federal AW ban:18 U.S.C. § 921  is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the Code, and it defines a federally banned AW as follows:(30) The term "semiautomatic assault weapon" means -(A) any of the firearms, or copies or duplicates of the firearms in any caliber, known as -(i) Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs (all models);(ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil;(iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70);(iv) Colt AR-15;(v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, and FNC;(vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9, and M-12;(vii) Steyr AUG;(viii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and(ix) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as (or similar to) the Street Sweeper and Striker 12;(B) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -(i) a folding or telescoping stock;(ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;(iii) a bayonet mount;(iv) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and(v) a grenade launcher;(C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -(i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip;(ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer;(iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned;(iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; and(v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm; and(D) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of -(i) a folding or telescoping stock;(ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;(iii) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds; and(iv) an ability to accept a detachable magazine.(4) for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device, machinegun (as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)[this being the tie-in to the NFA tax ban on machine guns]Note, by the way, that these definitions still exist in the US Code and have NOT been repealed or have expired.  What expired was a portion of another statute, which made it a crime to possess these weapons. For reference, that statute is 18 U.S.C. § 922  [which lists several acts committed with firearms considered to be crimes. The AW ban added the following language, which has since expired but still exists in the Code]:(v)(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon.(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of the enactment of this subsection.(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -(A) any of the firearms, or replicas or duplicates of the firearms, specified in Appendix A to this section, as such firearms were manufactured on October 1, 1993;(B) any firearm that -(i) is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action;(ii) has been rendered permanently inoperable; or(iii) is an antique firearm;(C) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than 5 rounds of ammunition; or(D) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than 5 rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine.The fact that a firearm is not listed in Appendix A shall not be construed to mean that paragraph (1) applies to such firearm. No firearm exempted by this subsection may be deleted from Appendix A so long as this subsection is in effect.(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -(A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);(B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;(C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving a firearm, of a semiautomatic assault weapon transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or(D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.(w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.(3) This subsection shall not apply to -(A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);(B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;(C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving ammunition, of a large capacity ammunition feeding device transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or(D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of any large capacity ammunition feeding device by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.(4) If a person charged with violating paragraph (1) asserts that paragraph (1) does not apply to such person because of paragraph (2) or (3), the Government shall have the burden of proof to show that such paragraph (1) applies to such person. The lack of a serial number as described in section 923(i) of this title shall be a presumption that the large capacity ammunition feeding device is not subject to the prohibition of possession in paragraph (1).

1	So the argument there seems to be that gun crime has been rising despite the strict gun laws of England. The statistics show both a rise and fall in gun crime:"In the year ending 31 March 2005 provisional figures show a:"16% reduction in the use of handguns 9% reduction in robberies involving firearms 6% reduction in serious injuries from firearms offences Despite these figures, the number of overall offences involving firearms has been increasing each year since 1997/98. And crime involving imitation weapons was up 55% in 2004-05 compared to the previous year. (Source: Crime in England and Wales 2004/2005)"Also of concern is a rise in the number of young people carrying real or imitation firearms in an attempt to boost their image or from a mistaken idea about self-protection."http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-v...ime/gun-crime/In addition, the rise in gun crime may be mostly due to the big rise in the number of replica and air guns being used in crime:"Imitation weapons were used in 3,332 offences in 2004/05, an increase of more than half (55%) from 2003/04....Ball-bearing (BB) guns are easy to purchase and often look like real weapons....Anti-firearms campaigners would like to see much tighter controls for all other types of weapons, including an outright ban on the production, sale, and possession of BB guns, airguns, and replica guns....The police say that in 2003 replica firearms were used in an estimated 60% of robberies and four out of five of all firearms offences. Nearly three quarters (72%) of firearms seized by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2003 under Operation Trident, set up to tackle gun crime within London’s black communities, were replicas, air guns, or starter pistols."http://www.crimeinfo.org.uk/servlet/...ory=factsheets

1	The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes. I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them.  Cybererratus is a very interesting persona. He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.  Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.  And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.  I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling.

1	Since when? So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized, then it means I agree with them? I thought this was a discussion board. That means we, you know, DISCUSS THINGS.Now, if I had said "Here is AiG's article and I couldn't agree with them more", then you would have an argument.As I did not, you don't. Now, do you retract your false statement that what you quoted was my reasoning?
1	But creation isn't a theory and it's definitely not science. And science isn't based on assumptions and extrapolations. Perhaps you should take a science course. Science is based on observation, hypothesis, prediction, and testing.
0	Excellent point. If the government only gave civil unions to everyone (heteros and gays alike) and the churches got to do the religious side of it, Civil Unons would be excellent. Unfortunately, those opposing gay marriage would never agree to such a thing.
0	Well both could be a good mother because i know a mother who was very certain she didn't want her baby and went for an abortion but was too late on in her pregnancy to have one and then she was going to give himup fpr adoption but as soon as he was born she loved him and couldn't bear to give him up and know she's a great Mum. Being a good mother mainly depends on what you are like with you're child after birth.
1	So do I, but my reasoning is highly speculative, even by my own standards.  there is no doubt the human body is all about manifestation of energy, not just electrical. just saying  hi  is creating sound energy through the kinetic energy of your jaw muscles, lung and vocal cords, which was converted from the chemical energy stored in the food you ate.  but proving that energy occurs in the human body does not address the question of life itself. If life itself is a form of energy, then it must either be constant at all times (ie, cannot be created or destroyed). Or, it can be converted from one form to another. or both...
0	This statement almost defines pathetic. Anyone who requires the gov't to validate who they call family, or who they love and share their life with really needs to get their priorities sorted out.
1	 Laws restricting ownership of any weapon is unconstitional.   Are you saying that private citizens should be able to own nuclear and biological weapons according to the second amendment?
1	Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.

1	Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.
1	So we can't base our definition of  kind  on mere appearances?  I mean if we are going to put things into categories and call the category  kind , we should do this by common appearances. A penguin is in the same kind as a hummingbird, but is a lobster in the same kind as an oyster? Obviously a lobster and a shrimp would be in the same kind, but could a dolphin and a manatee be in the same kind? Did they evolve from a common ancestor kind?  And since apes look and act so much like humans, didn't they just evolve from humans? By all appearances, they we must all be in the same kind.

1	But a scientist makes his bones by clashing with what people want to hear and being correct. Eventually, if enough supportive evidence is accumulated, then old theories are overthrown. The problem with creationism is that there is no theory and there isn't a single thread of supportive evidence.
1	And yet the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center can come up with only a handful of incidents where a concealed carry holder assaulted another. Not even 300 incidents, as opposed to countless hundreds of thousands of concealed carry holders who have never done anything wrong. The math speaks for itself, you lose this one as well.
1	Yes, it means the kind of regulations that would be necessary to create an effective militia, not necessarily those aimed at protecting public safety. And it is because groups like the NRA don't advocate such legislation that Cornell says that neither side is interested in protecting or returning to the original right to bear arms.
0	Oh wait, I have...I was a creationist for 18 years of my life. 10 of which I was coherent enough to understand some aspects of science and about 5 of which I understood the more complex ones. I know all the Creationist arguments, I have used them. And I used to be a darn good creationist debater...I could almost convince atheists who just didn't understand enough science to refute me. I had learned evolution in high school. I could repeat the facts, but I didn't believe them. I never argued with high school biology teachers becasue they didn't know enough about it to argue back. Then cam college. I took a course in evolution, because I am a curious and open-minded person. I went to class I took the notes and I talked to my prof. during his office hours. For each of the proofs he gave me, I gave him reasons (creationist arguments) that they weren't proof or that they were wrong, and he was able to easily refute any argument I gave him. I always questioned him and refuted things in the book, but he always refuted mine right back, and he did a better job and used undeniable empirical evidence. (No I am not going to give you any here I have neither the time nor the degree) At this point I was a very confused Christian, I talked to other Christians, I found sites online and then I found a creationist debate site. I asked what they thought and after hearing points from all sides: atheist, hard-core creationist, theistic evolution, self-righteous butt heads. I came to my own conclusion with all the facts that I had. Since then I have seen Kent Hovind speak...and I uh...won't go there. The fact of the matter is...can my belief in an old evolved earth withstand creationist arguments...I would say so. Have I taken classes in Creation...heck yeah. Will I take more in the future...sure if I think they have anything to add to my knowledge. In fact there is a professor at my college who is a creationist and if he ever speaks I will certainly go to hear him. So am I close minded or afraid to learn something new or change my opinion...no. I look to find the truth through facts and knowledge. Because after all when you find truth you find God. So instead of attempting to turn my question back to me, why don't you actually ask yourself...are you afraid to take a detailed class in evolution taught by someone with a PhD...could Creationism stand up to it. I can't answer that question for you, and I can't even tell you whether you should try to find the answer or not, it's your choice. But don't forget, whenever you believe something don't just belive it because someone said so, find out WHY you believe it to make sure that you should
1	On the face of it, the implication is that this kind of thing happens all the time; that everywhere you look, stress-induced hypermutation is occurring, and along with it adaptive mutations are occurring disproportionately often - that this is part and parcel of everyday evolution.The ardour with which this evidence is brandished is, however, misleading. In only a handful of studies, using specific strains of bacteria with specific genetic features under specific environmental circumstances, have specific adaptive mutations seemed to occur with anomalous frequency. There is no suggestion that these cases are in any way generally representative, and even if the results were being interpreted correctly, the idea that they constitute evidence for a pan-species mechanism of internally directed evolution is, unfortunately, wishful thinking.But what of these rare anomalous cases? The most famous was reported by J. Cairns and P. L. Foster, in which a dish of starving, non-growing E-coli (a particular strain with a Lac- mutation) appeared to preferentially induce a reversion mutation (to Lac+) in order to enable growth when the only source of energy was lactose. Moreover, the mutation did not occur with such frequency if lactose was not present, if there was another growth-inhibiting factor in play, or if food sources other than lactose were available. On top of that, although the adapted bacteria showed evidence of accumulating other non-selected mutations, it was nowhere near enough to explain the rate of adaptive mutation, and the bacteria which didn't adapt showed no accumulation of unselected mutations at all!Understandably, this looked to them, and other people at the time, like a pretty cut'n'dried example of an environmentally-or-organismically induced adaptive mutation.However, the nagging problem remained that this event was completely unprecedented, and was not observed in the general case of bacteria under starvation conditions. Why was this strain of bacteria so good at inducing this particular reversion mutation in just those circumstances?The answer, as it turned out, was that the experimental assumption of 'no growth' taking place in the e-coli colony was in error.The strain of e-coli used in the experiment had a 'leaky' (inefficient) mutant Lac allele, with only 1% to 2% of the normal ability to process lactose. That 1% to 2% was then deliberately 'smothered' by the experimenters through the addition of scavenger cells which mopped up the product of what little lactose the e-coli could process, effectively halting their growth. Because the later, visible growing colonies of e-coli had a reversion mutation to lac+, the experimenters deduced that mutation was required for growth to be possible.However, what they did not take into account at the time was that during normal growth prior to incubation on the test medium, a small proportion of the e-coli colony experienced a duplication of the leaky lac gene. This mutation conferred no advantage - until the colony was plated on lactose. Now, the second copy of the gene increased the total amount of lactose they could process beyond the ability of the scavenger cells to inhibit growth, and the e-coli could (slowly) grow and divide.Within these slow-growing microcolonies, selection favoured those cells which experienced further lac- duplications. And the more lac- duplications a cell has, the more likely one of them will experience a reversion mutation to lac+, explaining the apparently anomalous frequency of that particular mutation. When this happens, cell growth rate jumps considerably - but now it is the additional lac- genes which are holding the organism back, destabilising the chromosome and tying up resources which could be more efficiently processed by the lac+ gene. Selection now favours those lac+ revertants who lose the unstable lac- duplications. By the time the microcolonies become visible to the naked eye, they consist almost entirely of lac+ revertants.This hypothesis agrees with all observations related to the earlier experiments, and was verified in a number of ways, including repeating the experiment with a colony composed entirely of duplicate lac- bacteria, increasing the number of microcolonies 100-fold, which tallies with the ~1% background rate of chromosomal duplications in those bacteria. Also, bacteria in the late-arriving microcolonies were observed to possess residual duplicate lac- genes.In short, the results of the experiment agree completely with classical evolutionary theory.It should be noted, by the way, that in addition to the late-arriving 'directed mutation' microcolonies that causes such a stir, the original experimenters also observed the expected number of early-appearing colonies from pre-plating revertant mutants, a la L&D.EDIT: Reading further around the subject, it seems no stress-induced hypermutable state was involved either. Apparently, 10-20% of the bacteria with lac- duplications also possessed 'dinB' (a mutation-promoting gene apparently, though it's beyond the scope of my research here) on the same plasmid. The mutagen 'came along for the ride' so to speak, as selection favoured the duplication of that section of DNA, and induced hgher rates of mutation in - yep - 10-20% of the adaptive population.So not only was the hypermutational state of that subpopulation not the cause of the adaptive mutation (clearly, since the other 80-90% of adaptation happened without it), it was actually harmful.Live n learn!2ND EDIT: The same experiment yields similar results with lac- situated within the chromosome itself, only with 100-fold fewer colonies, reflecting the lower incidence of chromosomal duplication and reversion events in comparison with plasmids.

0	And??? What is the question? So none of the conditions that I mentioned and maybe some that I didn't even have the knowledge to consider don't exist in a zoo. And yet, I have some doubts about the survival of an animal in +100 degree temperatures when it is adapted to an environment where 50 degrees is hot, and -30 is common.
1	Yes, really.  Lungs from swim bladders? Takes millions upon millions of years? What's so crazy about that?  Again, minor changes over sufficient time add up to what?  What makes you think that lots of little changes can't do the job (apart from incredulity, that is)?  Where is the barrier to stop minor changes adding up to big changes?  Where did you get the idea that a dog evolved to a human? It's exactly that kind of comment that makes people with a smattering of scientific education say 'go read a book on biology before you say that dogs evolved into humans'.  Humans did not evolve from dogs and ToE has never suggested that this is so. It's that kind of comment that makes me wonder how much you know about biology. My nephew knows that humans evolved from human like ancestors; not dogs and he's only 11, for Christ sake!
1	Well, I incorrectly assumed that anyone attempting to enter the discussion would at least have a grasp of the most fundamental principles. It is quite strange to encounter someone in this day and age who lacks any knowledge whatsoever of the mechanism of adaptation since it was explained 150 years ago. It is one of Darwin's original hypotheses, independently arrived at by Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin called this mechanism of adaptive change natural selection. It is based on a few simple observations and inferences. Here is how Ernst Mayr, formulator of the biological species concept and one of the evolutionary biologists responsible for the modern synthesis, put it:
1	But wouldn't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves? That is, does one have to believe that the two specimens (which share biochemical similarities) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient (and more scientific?).
1	The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it.
1	Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, "Turkana Boy" It is also sometimes called "Nariokotome Boy". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil.
0	Oh, buddy, Atheism has EVERYTHING to do with that. The morality-less framework of Atheism ALLOWED them to justify the horrors that they inflicted.
1	Or, spend three months pregnant and then get an abortion, then you lose only one  potential  human instead of four. (WHY MENSTRUAL CYCLES, GOD, WHY?!)  NOTE:  To clear up any misconception, I am not promoting, condoning, or admitting to the act of rape. This is simply parody of what happens when we use unrealistic standards. I'm sure that Joe doesn't promote the rape of women to prevent the passing of unfertilized ova, but I think that his lack of doing so is inconsistent with his position expounded upon above.
1	A radio telescope can see wavelengths that we can't, and then electronically map those wavelengths to colors we can see. Here's an example:  http://science.hq.nasa.gov/skyspy/ht...sn1604rad.html  Or, on the other end of the spectrum, you could use an x ray telescope, again mapping the wavelengths we can't see to those that we can:  http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/so...solar_014.html  Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at.  If we can't see the wavelengths that something is giving off, then we can't see it. Every object around you right now is giving off infrared light, but even if the room were pitch dark you wouldn't be able to see the glow because our eyes don't pick up that wavelength. It would just look dark.  Mistakes are always possible, but not due to what you seem to be concerned about. For the sort of science you seem to be refering to we don't use naked eye observations. We use machines designed to pick up the appropriate wavelengths of light. We know the limitations of the eye, and so built tools that can do things the eye can't.
1	Just like the Brady Campaign. Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals, most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with, or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and weren't crimes to begin with.

1	It's a consideration, but I doubt we should be promoting this under the  population control  banner.  All these figures are really telling us is that society needs further education when it comes to contraception.

1	1) you're assuming that all Christians are biblical literalists  2) you are ignoring the fact that these people are specific people chosen by god (as the link points out)  3) you are ignoring the fact that Psalm 139 saying 'All the days ordained for me were written in Your Book before one of them came to be' suggests that whether you are aborted or not is God's plan anyway.  4) you are assuming that God knowing or making someone makes them a human being: doesn't God know plants, and make and measure the sea?
1	Yes, it recognizes there will be religion in our country, it allows all to follow which ever religion suits that individual as long as it does not impose upon others who do not follow that religious system. Our constitution allows for dissent, opposition and opinions. It actually requires such dissent in order to come to conclussions which would serve everyone equally. If for some reason there is a practice which excludes certain individuals from the protections of the law, then it needs to be challenged.
1	No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se.
1	With what? The Theropod dinosaurs were the size of a large bird, were excelent runners and probably ate insects. The first birds, as far as we can tell from the fossil evidence, were gliders so probably spent time in the trees. Small, agile, gliding dinosaurs could exploit an previously unoccupied niche.
0	So far, you've been nothing but wrong.
1	I know at least one person from the Netherlands who owns a pistol. Are you sure that it is ENTIRELY illegal to own a firearm, or is it possible to obtain a permit for one?Also, the whole "school shooting" business in the US is not really any sort of major problem. The thing is, the media reports every single incident making it seem more common than it really is.As far as uses for a gun: In the US lots of people live in rural areas where it could take police about an hour, or even longer, to respond. People in that situation cannot rely on police protection. In addition, our police force is NOT obligated to serve as a protection force for citizens. Instead, our police are supposed to solve crimes after they occur.People in the US grew up with firearms and shooting sports. Hunting, trap and skeet, and target shooting are important parts of American culture. In fact, our government thought it was so important for citizens to be able to use firearms that they created the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). The CMP sells high-powered military surplus rifles at cost, to US citizens.Joszi and Bram, what experience with firearms do you have? Maybe a day at the range would change your opinions. :) pickleweaseler--The US of A (the REAL best country to live [in])

1	But, of course, religion is a mere matter of brainwashing and programming. Some people, very obviously, need this sort of intrusion into their lives because they can't figure it out for themselves.And, there are some very profound and meaningful religious teachings.However, if one is not permitted to question the tenets of a particular belief system, I find that dangerous.Like in your sect. You do expect complete obedience, do you not? No questioning of your authority?
1	Will it be 100% legal for you to carry a gun?If the answer is yes. Then so what? So what if people react with panic? If you are 100% legal, then it is your right to carry a gun. Your rights are just as important as thiers.I was once reported by a woman at a gas station for carrying a gun. I was not carrying concealed. I was very professionally dressed and driving a very yuppie car. When the cops came by, I was not the one the cops were XXXXXX at.BTW before the cops arrived I had removed the pistol from my hip and placed it in the glove box.
0	How long ago were those instances? Things have changed a lot in my opinion, over the years.
1	The likely flaw of this argument is defining Communism. Communism as defined by Marx and Engel has never been implemented. Furthermore, Communism as defined by Marx and Engel IS democracy. Often people either forget that or have no idea what Communism is. Historically, Communist supporting ideology candidates that have won democratic elections have been removed by force (or attempted) by Western powers. Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, several African nations including Mozambique, the list is actually quite long.
1	That's incorrect. The Constitution begins with Article 1 which does not contain the Bill of Rights. The Constitution contains seven articles which are followed by the Bill of Rights and the rest of the amendments. If you really are from England as you claim then I guess your lack of knowledge about the American Constitution is understandable.

1	Well, the unborn qualifies for this...so we can conclude, using YOUR logic, that the unborn...from conception on....is, in fact, a human being.  You can remove the foot from your mouth now.
1	As Mach pointed out, you (Montalban) are arguing with yourself here.You stated that "bacteria needing nylon to survive" is put forth as evidence for evolution. Then you said that an alternate view was that there are some bacteria that need nylon to survive.Anyway, an actual alternate view is that the experiments performed to determine whether the bacteria could survive on nylon alone could not have been exhaustive. There may still be a natural substance on which the bacteria survives. It may even be similar to nylon, but it has yet to be discovered. This is a big maybe, though.

1	No, if abortion were no easier on the woman there would be no reason to keep abortion around. In fact, if transfering the fetus were easier (say, teleportation), I would be against allowing abortion.
1	Here's what those verses - and the one in the middle of them that he conveniently left out - say.
1	Because Apes, monkeys and chimps are on different paths. You wouldn't expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda-like animal. things evolve to fill niches, we currently fill a niche, there is nothing pushing apes, chimps or other primates to fill a niche that is occupied. 
1	Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.
1	Well, look who's all pompous about something, and still get it wrong. Either way, earth or universe, you are still wrong, as for many decades the age of the universe has been put in the high single digits to the teens. We have never claimed it was 4 billion years old, that would just be retarted, as that is the age of the earth. Maybe you should check your facts and make sure you don't get them wrong whentrying to argue about the subject.
0	Even if it was murder, do you really expect me to side with the party that broke into Martin's house and robbed him?
1	You really have a strange definition of faith.Scientific laws require reproducible results (patterns).That's how they got to be laws.I believe that the acceleration due to the gravity of the earth will have the same value tomorrow that it had yesterday because there is no indication that this pattern will change.It's not because of faith, or at least certainly not due to the kind of faith required to believe in the supernatural. Your definition of faith sounds like an exercise in solipsim.I can't prove you are a human and not a computer so I have to have faith that you really are a human (despite all the patterns I have built up in my brain over time.)
0	That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.
1	The war isn't the reason banks shelled out millions of dollars to people who could never repay it. All that money came from somewhere, like corporations that expected to see a return on their investments.

0	No problem. I personally believe killing innocent children is wrong. Yet, I also believe that a woman's decision to murder her child is between her and her god. I wouldn't remove individual choice. It's not mine to make.  But this isn't the right forum for that.  Back to the OP: False dichotomy, or obfuscation and refusal to answer the stated question?
0	A murder is an illegal killing. Abortion is currently legal, thus an abortion is not a murder.  And I support the right to kill unborn babies or not as the mother in question see fit.
1	You know, I'm thinking of suggesting that they put a permanent link to an online dictionary on this forum. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=designedYou could take "intelligently" to mean that the being is conscious of what it's doing; that it's doing what it is purposefully.

You don't matter enough to have rights or the rights you want are labeled to be trivial.Because your violating those rights of "someone". Though those "someone" can not name the right your violating.

1	it means you can join the national guard, get a clue.
1	Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of  creation science  and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.  But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.
0	Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.  (Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)
1	And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.
0	Dunno. It's not like any evidence has ever been presented, so how can we say?
1	And who gets to decide if it is "justified"? Rest assured that the right-wing fundies won't allow YOU to do so for yourself.
1	Because there is no reason to do so.
1	so do you think the Soviets, er -- silly me -- I mean Darwinists, will put 2 + 2 together and proclaim to the world that since one's environment (diet, environmental toxins, etc) can cause disease that one could eliminate/control this disease by eliminating the environmental source that's causing it? I think this would explain why cancer is getting to be so wide-spread in society and why younger and younger people are developing it. The cause of disease has nothing to do with the genes themselves...as Dr. Bruce Lipton says, "It's the environment, stupid." Of course if this little secret got out (that people could cure themselves by changing their internal and/or external environments) then Big medicine, including millions and millions of people would be without a paycheck. We can't have that. The sad thing though, as your article indicates, is disease doesn't just end with the person who has it...diseases often get carried forward into future generations, making children (and their children) more vulnerable.
1	No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word "prayer?" Why not?
1	Why should he put it in context when even most Christians don't? The majority of Christians in the world are not bible scholars and know very little of its actually history. There are some who even believe that the bible, as a whole, has existed unchanged since the beginning of time. They are really surprised when they find out it has really only existed, as a whole, for around 1600 to 1700 years, and that it has been revised several times with books being added and some removed, and even some edited.
1	It depends, now, doesn't it.  What are you looking to do with it. It is a great set of stories to derive moral principles out of, if you look at it in the proper light (THe key is stories). From a historical point of view, it gives insight into the culture and concepts of an early people.  Like anything, it is what you make of it.
1	Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.  NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require  26 .  If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.  A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors.

1	"cave men" did not leave hieroglyphs, unless you want to call ancient Egyptians cave men. The first drawings in caves were found by Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola in 1879.
1	I think the definition of human, in context, would be a person that is alive. Dead does not make them human in this context. Scientifically, human may mean Homo Sapiens, but there are other methods of defining humans. One of them is their capacity to love and to worship. Worship is not seen in another animal. Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed.Either way, loving and worship are behaviors and as my psychology prof used to say......."Dead people don't behave."

I'm sure it was a lot more than 35 mph!And you have the nerve to talk about "responsibility" or how this woman was a jerk?Or to call me names?Dearest, I never speed because I take my responsibilities as a citizen so seriously, and i have never received a speeding ticket.Were you driving under the influence as well?How many lives did you put at risk, Archangel?What pomposity! What hypocrisy!
0	Is there a difference?
1	Thou shalt not commit adultery. I'm to lazy to look for anyone dealing with premaritial sex. Adultery and premaritial sex are sin, because God says not to participate in them.
0	You mean yours. Make up your mind as to whether or not there's a problem and what it is. State for the board.
1	Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings.

1	Yes, there are differences, but the claim is not that the other stories were identical, just that they preceded the time Jesus is claimed to have lived, and that elements of these various Â“foreshadowingÂ” stories were very similar to those told about Jesus.  Continuing for a second on the idea of the eucharist having been Â‘borrowedÂ’ by Christians from earlier traditions:
1	According to what? Are you saying you should be able to kill a baby 2 inches from being born if you wanted? It isn't born yet.
1	Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:  1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.  2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood.
1	Mandatory storage laws are in violation of the Second Amendment because they interfere with personal defense, by making your defensive weapon inaccessible when you need it. I don't care if you use the justification of it only applying when you're not at home, that's not good enough; trouble can follow you home and attack before you can unpack your weapon now that you're there.Then there's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose. Responsible people already lock up their guns, they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers, they don't need a law to tell them to do what they're already doing. Such a proposal takes away responsibility, it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it.There's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that isn't a crime or a threat to anyone's safety. Who should law enforcement be targeting more, a dangerous gang with ties to the mexican mafia, or a single mom who forgot about putting her pistol in the safe before going to the grocery store?Police resources are limited as is. I don't see why we should be squandering what resources we have, going after people for technical violations rather than true crimes that victimize anyone and everyone.
1	You have  shown  no such thing to be true. You have asserted, without evidence and without study.
0	No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public.
1	(Sorry to hear you lost an hour's worth of work... I hate it when that happens!)I may not have made this clear, but here are the facts:1) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization. It is pointless to argue this fact, because the evidence to suggest that this is true is insurmountable. The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child (whichever label you choose) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens. Period.2) Just because something is human does not necessarily make it a 'human being' or a 'person.' These are not scientific terms. It is impossible to 'prove' that a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being' under all possible interpretations of a 'human being.' The argument could be made, for example, that a 'being' must have some sort of self-awareness. It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness.So, to answer your question, regardless of what anyone believes, a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on.My question to you: What do you consider to be the reason the pre-birth baby is a 'human being' that deserves 'personhood' according to the law?
1	Actually it was a watch on the heath. Yes, you can see the difference, but what is that difference? If you haven't identified it then you are as clueless as IDers are in how we detect manufactured artifacts.However, IDers have given you a clue. They just ignore it themselves. This is from Behe's Darwin's Black Box:"For a simple artificial object such as a steel rod, the context is often important in concluding design. If you saw the rod outside a steel plant, you would infer design. Suppose however, that you traveled in a rocket ship to a barren alien planet that had never been explored. If you saw dozens of cylindrical steel rods lying on the side of a volcano, you would need more information before you could be sure that alien geological processes -- natural for the planet -- had not produced the rods." Michael Behe, Darwin's Black Box, pp 195-196
1	Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born.  And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption.
1	The founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote. They didn't want mob rule and chaos. "Most of the Founders believed that property ownership was essential to good citizenship and therefore that only property owners should be able to vote. 'Property', in those days, also included slaves, of course, and half of the Founders were slave owners....The maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote. In 1787, there were about four million people living in the 13 original states. But only about four percent of them, it is estimated, could vote. Excluded were the one million slaves, the two million women, anyone under the age of 21, and all non-property owners."http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/22/lonsdale.html
1	A minor point, but your opening question is confined to "during pregnancy" and your concluding scenario is confined to childcare. The baby has no need of breast milk or a substitute formula until it is a breathing human. In that case, the mother (at least in the USA) is obligated to feed it, whether she uses her own milk or a substitute.I do not understand the interest in things before the 14th Amendment.*************************The 14th Amendment:Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,(See Note 15) and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void. Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. **************************This has little to do with a mother's obligations and rights regarding her children. It does prohibit states from denying rights, but it says nothing of a mother's milk. States do have laws against deliberately starving children.
0	Out-and-out lie. There's really no other way to put this.
0	Whey do you think you will be that mature. Let us know. In the mean time, your constant superstitions delusions based on ancient mythology are boring.
1	Yes, although that line changes over time.
1	Ok, this doesn't address my point which is that none of the current bills in congress lower the costs of health care or anyone.
1	No, Mega posted a long editorial from the guardian which was written after the police arrested the owner of a conversion factory. It's interesting that they claim the gun crimes stats have gone up, when all the sources I've seen show that violent gun crime has gone down. That's the guardian for you. It doesn't show that we have high crime rates whichever stats you accept.
1	Actually, there is no such implication. However, there are some things that we might expect if all life is descended from a common ancestor. For one thing, we might expect that the molecule of heredity would be the same across all life. We find that it is DNA. We would expect that the particular codons that encode amino acids would be quite similar for all forms of life. That turns out to be the case, except for minor variations in some primitive forms of life, the DNA code is identical across life. We would expect to see a nested hierarchy of species and we do. We find that house cats are similar to the other 36 species of cat, which are carnivores, which are mammals, which are tetrapods, which are vertebrates, which are chordates. We would expect to find transitional species between major groups of animals, and we do. We find feathered dinosaurs and birds with bony tails and teeth. We find whales with feet. We find reptiles that are very much like mammals, even some with a double jointed jaw that was part of the transition of reptile jaw bones to the inner ear of mammals. We even find mammals that lay eggs.
1	So you see, Brady, you're wrong again. The McDonald ruling wasn't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups. Quite the opposite. The McDonald ruling was about striking against those with racist and evil intentions who would use the law to render innocent people helpless for no good reason. It was as much about protecting minorities from harm as anything.
1	What's your definition of pure?
1	Although few mothers would do such a thing, I think that it is clear a mother would have the same right to do this as with a world-famous violinist. The fact that we would disapprove of such a women is not really important: emotive reactions don't constitute proof. If they did, the writer could simply say: 'I think women who have abortions are terrible' and his job would be done.  I'm dubious about the whole human rights basis of much modern debate on issues like abortion - I support neither the premises, reasoning or conclusion of the violinist argument. But this whole counter-argument seems to me extremely weak.
0	Arguments are infinite, your time is not, Slave. This claim is opposed to Real Ultimate Truth. Go back and beg Society to take pity on you, Slave.
0	Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.
1	Different version here too. "No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD , even down to the tenth generation." Forbidden: not permitted or allowed
1	I think your theory too simple. Guns make it easier to kill people. Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun? "From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders. (Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes."http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm
0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).
0	You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be.  This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs.
0	If you can convince me that your soul mate, best friend, the one that you can't think of anyone else you would want to share your life, dreams, fears, successes with, who knows what your thinking and loves you anyway and feels the same then sure I guess I would consider it. Since we are on the subject of ridiculous how about a snowflake or a pine tree or a sunflower seed, talk about love blossoming.
1	But you said that they happen at the same time, then you contradict yourself. Make up your mind. And high pressure systems can prevent expansion while raising temperature.
0	You mean yours. Make up your mind as to whether or not there's a problem and what it is. State for the board.
1	Well, ok. You're wrong because evolving viruses are examples of evolution, as are bacteria and the new strains that have become resistant to antibiotics. But if you want some examples I'll give three. I certainly hope that you have the courtesy to read them and actually think about them.
0	Your question, which has been pointed out already, has a theological basis - God is supposed to have given us dominion over the rest of creation etc. But what separates us from other mammals (if we restrict the question to that class of vertebrates) is reckoned to be  self consciousness  - the human mind that can deliberate upon and analyse its own thought processes.
0	funny how darwinists, when presented with evidence that lifeforms are intelligent and dynamic -- which refutes their mechanistic theory -- turn around claim it as evidence for their theory.  Go figure. I guess that's about all they can do at this point: play dumb and hope nobody notices.
1	I don;t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india, and don't really see it's relevance, since colonial india is gone. I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).
1	No, the origin of the universe has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. Scientific disciplines have bounds. Biologists don't have to account for cosmology because it has nothing to do with the evolution of life on earth. However the universe came into being doesn't affect the theory of evolution. However life first arose has no bearing on the theory of evolution. The ultimate origin has nothing to do with the theory of evoution. I don't see where the definition you quoted does anything to make this point.......
0	Ho, hum... humanist, atheistic babble that does nothing but keep you running in circles, thinking you are actually getting somewhere.
0	So Steeeeve, you think that  fewer than 1000 deaths  per year is a reasonable price to pay for outlawing elective abortion?  And to add to what simone said figures on abortion as quoted by a site with a Roman Catholic agenda are one of the least unbiased souces of information you could cite in this debate.
0	You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd, to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling, right?
1	You know what? You're starting to remind me an awful lot of reverend Jackson and reverend Phlaeger (the one who said they were going to kill anyone that didn't support their ideas of gun control). The claimed that a gun shop owner was intentionally violating the laws of Chicago and selling all kinds of weapons to gang members, simply by being one mile outside of the Chicago city limits.Your entire argument is that since there are firearms dealers within a certain distance to the Mexico/America border, then they must obviously be outfitting the mexican drug cartels.You've hung yourself with this article you just posted, and I'm gonna explain why. The ATF has said there are 6,700 licensed dealers along the border, meaning they know exactly where they are. So why exactly isn't the ATF going in there and breaking them up for their illegal activities? After all if close proximity is an unquestionable sign of guilt, then the ATF must know that these guys are equipping mexican drug cartels with fully automatic machine guns (the kinds that the American people can't ever get) and grenades and rocket launchers, and maybe even the odd nuclear warhead.The ATF shut down Red's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos. So why aren't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they're doing anything wrong? It's illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp, and it's not possible for civilians to own post-'86 model automatic weapons, so why isn't the ATF doing something about it if they're breaking the laws?Seriously Aussie, what is it, is the ATF saying "We know they're breaking the laws, but they're not doing anything illegal we can bust them on"?
1	But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed. Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process, which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given.
1	You are correct. That fossil species have gone extinct is an observation.
1	No it doesn't!It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone. WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us, plus the cost of keeping them in jail. The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions.It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole.
1	Sandy suppose you lived in New York and knew it was 3000 miles between California and New York Now suppose there was a car that was parked in your driveway that you also knew had been driven from California and that car had a maximum speed of 100 miles per hour. That would of course mean it would have taken at least 30 hours to make the drive. Do you see how you could deduce that the car was at least 30 hours old?  ThatÂ’s the same principle used for dating the stars and the universe. If we know how far away a star is and we know the maximum speed of light, then the star must be at least as old as the time it would take for the light to get to the earth so we could see it.
0	Well that explains the twisted thought pattern on our constitution is broken.
0	Pretty close to what we are doing.  It is going to be outdoors, in my boss's backyard (nice area). It will be small, family, friends, 40 people tops. We will have some kind of food, haven't figured that yet. Got a really small budget. We plan on the vows, and rings and our parents doing something.  Lucky for us, we have great friends who want to plan it for us. But some details I feel we should decide.
1	oh, now we're getting somewhere. Explain more, please. Oh, and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too.
1	The war isn't the reason banks shelled out millions of dollars to people who could never repay it. All that money came from somewhere, like corporations that expected to see a return on their investments. They got nothing, they laid off people as a result, which lead to the rates of unemployment and the housing fiasco.
1	Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.  Barbarian observes:  It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.
1	Really? Please cite the scientific papers that report fossils of Marella, Yohoia, Naraoia, Waptia, Canadaspis, Pikaia, Opabinia, Anomalocaris, Hallucigenia, and Odontogriphus being found in Russia, Israel or Sumatra.
1	Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely, if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else. What interest would a state that doesn't recognize gay marriage in the first place have in allowing gay divorce?
1	I donÂ’t know if you actually read his/her entire post but God was invoked into it. So why canÂ’t I use any reference to God if they are using it?
0	You praise my former country's health care plan, championing it over anything else America might have...and you don't even know whether or not they get sick pay from work?  First you praise Canada's system, even though it only applies to Canadian citizens and it's a three year wait to become nationalized. And now you're praising Britain and you don't get sick leave over there.
0	Maybe they did it on purpose? They push through the amendment to quiet the RR while the issue is a hot botton topic, but make sure it's unconstitutional so that it'll get shot down.  Just a thought.
0	Oh, I LOVE semantics games emoticon_xhoho
0	So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.  You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions (a point I don't really care about) but unrelated to this topic...so if you want to talk about that, start another thread.  So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers?
1	If Obama gets elected he will walk straight into the worse financial crisis in the states for decades. Within weeks Russia,North Korea and Iran will test his resolve( China will wait to see what he does). This will keep him busy for a while. The last thing that he will want to do will be to address controversial issues like gun control or abortion. This will come in his second term or never!
0	And not one of these geniuses has even attempted to deal with the meat of my argument but will go around the edges of what I say looking to create disputes on terminology and senseless minutia. Anything to derail the thread.
0	You gather information from other forums, then use it as bait on yet another forum? Exactly how many forums do you belong to? I would hope you wouldn't be too surprised that others sometimes ignore you. Is this your main activity in life?

1	No other thoughts? I am doing this for a project and I've talked among peers, but no one seems at all knowledgeable or interested. I have more than an inkling as to why, but...O'well, no big problemo for me.
1	Thanks Patriot for the well researched response.Although I am not a gun rights advocate, I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding, here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons.First of all, I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange, and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary.However, the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature. That is, guns that are able to be fired rapidly, have a large magazine, and reasonable stopping power. Thus, although the ban would not eliminate all of the "dangerous" weapons ( I assume that an M1, the rifle that beat the Nazis, would be legal) it does cover a lot of them.Of course, most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what purpose the gun serves, it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want, no matter the purpose.What gun control advocates would say, however, is that the constitution says 'arms' not guns, and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this. I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons, for example. And, I for one, hope that is not what they meant, particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism.A common remark is "why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor?" The problem is that we don't know what the intention of everyone is, and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them.Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon, but the point is that (I think) most people don't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want, so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own. I don't think that I covered all of your points, Patriot, but this is getting long, so I will cut this off here, and I hope to get a response from you. I will be interested in your thoughts.-Dan
0	I see that you fail to see the logic that the less dominant Siamese twin ALSO has a right to their own body. One is not supporting the other - they are supporting each other so their rights are equal. Besides, both have a mental existence so, at least for me, abortion (or, in this case, one being killed for the rights to body of the other) would not be allowed.
0	It's just the same flip flopping over and over. Depending on the argument, "science doesn't exclude the divine", {then switcharoo}, "science proves there is no divine." Just depends on the setting of the argument. (you do have your copy of Victor Stenger's book; God - The failed Hypothesis / how science shows that God does not exist, don't you? Now you and five trolls will come pouring in here with needling and ad hominem attacks, to cover the weakness of your position. Your taunt of "XXXXXX" already got it started. I probably won't respond - it's funny and depressing at the same time.

1	So in short the best case scenario is we go from $6,000 per capita to.......$6,000 per capita. Basically this would mean less care for the already insured and more care fore the under insured..well, some of them.  This seems optimistic to me.
1	Well you should protect yourself of course, that is your right (and duty) as a human being, but that's not what the 2nd amendment is for. It's just convenient that the tools that protect you from tyranny can also be used to protect yourself against criminals.
1	We know this because the kids destroyed all the interactive exhibits within a day when the Earth Gallery opened. I for one was most upset as I'd been wanting to have a play too emoticon_cry
1	It's not an "arrogant assumption" to point out that religious faith involvesmaking a "leap in the dark" - it's a metaphor that attempts to illustratethe facts of the case.I'm saying that given ADEQUATE EVIDENCE, science, IN PRINCIPLE, cananswer all questions concerning the MATERIAL world. That is actuallyquite a limited statement if you bother to read it carefully.Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not havebeen accomplished in any other way, is not "raising science on a pedestal"- it's merely reciting the obvious.Yes, I am saying that reasoned arguments from anthropology can and doaccount for the evolution of morals, the law, etc. in human societies. Thegrowth in complexity of physical organisms is analogous to the growth ofsocial complexity in human societies: the study of the former can throwlight on the development of the latter.I have not tried to address the torrent of "points" that cascade intothe of rest of your post: I don't understand what you're talking about.As for the allegation that I'm driven by "ideology" - I haven't a clue whatsectarian policies you think control me.
0	First, I didn't say everyone in the world was religious, I said everyone in the world believed in A god. Second, the majority of the world believes there is a god, and the others don't want to believe (hope there isn't) a god and/or they believe they themselves are the only god of their body.
0	But why did you fear them, JP? Because they would discipline you? That's my case...and, so far, I guess I'm the only one that voted that way about God.  Some folks see God as a smiling XXXXX, skipping around throwing little flowers all about while we make wrong choices, sink deeper in sin, and try to cover ourselves in a blanket of self-righteousness.
0	As much as it pains me I'm going to agree with Mathew here. If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want. If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.  Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government.
0	think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is "wrong" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image

Totally irrelevant. In fact no one is even asking us.  We have a whole Federal Department dedicated to gun crimes and criminals. I can understand that you, and apparently people like the Illegal Mayors headed by Bloomberg might think they are not doing the job up to your standards, but Bloomie and his bunch was asked to cease and deist because they were ruining Federal and local investigations. The way I see it, is, you want special privileges with your law.
1	Yes. Because evolution requires an old earth, supersport has lumped geology into the evil conspiracy. As our best explanations for the formation of the earth appeal to cosmology, that field as well as astronomy fall within the realm of quack science, according to supersport. In fact, every scientific discipline that has any connection whatsoever to evolution must be corrupt; obviously, chemistry is one of them (we can't make glycogen or DNA without magical, "atheistic" polymerization, right?).
1	You seem to be arguing that a corpse is a human.
1	No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as "proof" of a young earth.

Even with all their tanks and superior arms, the nazis couldn't prove their superiority in short order.
1	But doesn't the walking fish still exist? Here's a photo and an article of the Walking Fish, also known as the Snakehead. It's becoming a real nuisance in this Country since its natural habitat is in Asia.  http://www.city.arao.kumamoto.jp/sis...e/mutugoro.jpg  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...snakehead.html  So how is that evidence of evolution at all? It breathes air, walks on land and still survives and thrives in the water in the modern world. Exactly what evolved from it again?
1	But we also don't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason. Your first part is already false (proved above).
1	That's the thing.  JPSartre12 can't point to anything inaccurate, so you see this mundane complaint that *you're posting something I don't like* ...  Quite frankly, if Christianity insists on trying to tell the government how it should perform marriages, I think that street should cut both ways and the government should be able to have input on how religion performs marriages...  JPSartre12's reply is reflective of the *anti-gay Christians are seeking discrimination against gays, but we're going to try to pretend we're the real victims while we bash them* school of thought.
0	Bigotry??  I have no idea what you mean there.  Anyway, I can't speak for the other thread, but I raised an issue that no pro-lifer has addressed, including you. So if you want to really have a discussion, start discussing instead of bickering.  Do you think that protesting a Planned Parenthood clinic might have an unintended consequence of discouraging someone from visiting who planned to obtain birth control, (or a Pap smear or other non-abortion service) thereby increasing the likelihood of an unwanted pregnancy (or cervical cancer, etc.)?

It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. (I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide). So cudos to those men.

C'mon Simone... let's coddle those little bats of common sense back under the belfry of reason where they are supposed to roost...

1	There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction.  As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the  Son of God  and the  Son of Man , which means  Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.  I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.  Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws.
0	Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.  You said you vowed to rob people and fight the government, and said that you have no problem with a women ending up broke and on the street. You've not really been all that nice yourself
0	Oh, and keep your lie - I mean, explanation - consistent with your entire post!
1	And pro- choice  doesn't distort? That alone shows an unreasonable look on the issue.  I agree that many are uneducated about the subject (which helps the pro-choicers I might add) and I think many that get an abortion are not educated about whether or not it is morally ok to do. Many have just grown up with it and assumed it to be ok (which neither side of the issue should support...there is nothing wrong with education on an issue).
1	The dead ones can't, and things like Cystic Fibrosis or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency are going to kill you easily before you reach sexual maturity without medical care. Genetic disease - kills people - dead people don't have babiesThe rest of natural selection fits in as lesser versions of that, healthy animals have more children and more of those survive. Hungry and unhealthy ones are going to have fewer, and likely fewer healthy ones. The cycle continues.
1	It should be noted that other exotic amino acids are also used by a few other codes (derived form the original). E.g. Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded for in many archaea and vertebrates. Archaea, however seem to be the most primitive organisms, thus these encoded amino acids must have been fixated early on.  Thus an interesting question can be applied to an  evolving  code as posited in the above quote:  Are these  still evolving  mRNAs, still evolving? Or did it hit an inevitable global optimum?  Secondly, from the article:
1	You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.  Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.
1	I would be interested to see where I made such a claim. Prove your assertion.

1	And to deny that there are no transitionals without having the integrity to at least making an effort to learn what you are talking about is ridiculous. There are lots of transitional fossils. Museums are full of them and more are being discovered on an almost daily basis. There are news stories that report them all over the place. Try reading At the Water's Edge: Fish with Fingers, Whales with Legs, and How Life Came Ashore but Then Went Back to Sea by Carl Zimmer. It will tell you about two transitional series. Also read Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight by Pat Shipman for the story of what we can learn from even limited transitional specimens and why. Also read The Mistaken Extinction: Dinosaur Evolution and the Origin of Birds by Lowell Dingus and Timothy Rowe. I found the book excellent even though recent finds of feathered dinosaurs have made some of the material a bit dated. It will give you an idea of how the fossil record fits together. At least you might learn what a transitional is.
1	I'm not familiar with the book, so can't comment upon it first hand. However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too. As I say I haven't read the original so cannot judge the quality of the link I'm supplying, so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well's case.
1	That ad is a flat out distortion of Palin's view.Her view is that the state governments should decide how to regulate abortions. The consequence of that view is that the state governments would be free to allow abortion, or prohibit abortion, on whatever basis and to whatever degree they wanted.
0	Oh irrational-boy, please do try to understand basic concepts.It's simple, I've been through this before.If you know something of the unknowable, then you contradict yourself. It's a self-contradictory statement. One you're fond of, I realize, but illogical just the same.You can test this by trying to show me something that is unknowable. See the dillema you face? Yes, self-contradiction. You may be so use to this feeling that you've grown numb to it, but in black and white, you are making a self-contradictory statement.This is the same reason you have to have faith. Rational demonstration is useless when trying to show something without evidence or without rational demonstration, which is the case with your "unknowable, self-contradictory" idea of a god.This is why you MUST believe through faith, which requires no rational demontration. It's no secret why faith needs no evidence, it CANNOT use evidence, it's the opposite of reason. Why do you think the term faith exists in the first place? Reason does fine with the rational world. You needed a word to fit the irrational. Otherwise, why would you need faith?It's the same reason you can have 1000 different gods and beliefs of gods out there and not a single one is somehow "more credible" than any other. They are all based without reason, without evidence, irrationally.All ties together rather neatly doesn't it?Science >> ReligionReason >> FaithRational >> IrrationalEvidence >> No evidenceReason: Capable of seperating truth from false (to degree, based on evidence), and thus produces knowledge (That which we find to be true).Faith: Incapable of producing ANY KNOWLEDGE----------------------------------Stick to your side of the fence please, unless you adopt reason as your means.-Mach
1	And I have left them feedback to see what happens. I noticed this particular entry was sourced from The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition so it is not something Dictionary.com wrote.  I can see Iuris' point but the entry is still laid out wrong if this is the case. As written,  Godlessness; immorality , implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym. I think this is because some use the term  godless , an adjective, to mean immoral but  godlessness , a noun, to mean atheistic.
1	Peppered moths simply emerged from the egg according to background...their  evolution  had nothing to do with random mutations or natural selection. Butterflies exhibit the same ability...they can emerge with specific wing variations/markings according to predators and other environmental influences. There is no selection.  http://ourfcs.friendscentral.org/mot...yphenism1.html (see bottom picture)  http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm  The authors note that what's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time  yea...no kidding.

1	Well, it happens in virtually every thread.Some disagreements are between individuals of essentially the same basic system [Protestant Christian vs Protestant Christian], [atheist rationalist vs atheist rationalist]. Many disagreements are between individual of differing belief systems. In such cases the individuals often use the same word to mean two different things.What is “evidence”? Well, that will depend on your core belief system. Sacred writings may be excellent evidence for your belief system, but when you say the Qu'ran proves an issue, the Christian says “That’s not evidence!”.One side tries to convince the other side that their core beliefs are incorrect, so they really have no evidence for their position.
0	There has been a lot of social speculation here, but none of it answers how legalizing gay marriage would harm the sanctity of marriage.  In other words can some one tell me why are a couple of fruits getting married going to lesson my marriage?
1	What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.  It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.  If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion.
1	Well, creationists claim he said that. However, there is no real evidence he ever did. They give two sources.. one says it is was in the 100th edition of the 'origin of species), and the other one was on the centinial edition (which is a real trick, since that is 4 years after his death). No one seems to be able to find the primary source for that quote. Imagine that.

1	Oh, it certainly is an issue. Martin Killias, a Swiss criminologist, did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in Switzerland. However, my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations. The law in Switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key.I don't think Switzerland is a gun-nut utopia.

If you haven't identified it then you are as clueless as IDers are in how we detect manufactured artifacts.  However, IDers have given you a clue. They just ignore it themselves. This is from Behe's Darwin's Black Box:   For a simple artificial object such as a steel rod, the context is often important in concluding design. If you saw the rod outside a steel plant, you would infer design. Suppose however, that you traveled in a rocket ship to a barren alien planet that had never been explored. If you saw dozens of cylindrical steel rods lying on the side of a volcano, you would need more information before you could be sure that alien geological processes -- natural for the planet -- had not produced the rods.

0	While 'commonly' may or may not be true, this does end up happening at least some of the time (and possibly a lot of the time). It's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent... for example, a woman enters a clinic because she's confused and thinking about getting an abortion... she wants to consider the option of abortion, though she's not really comfortable with the idea. The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure, and that lasting psychological effects rarely (if ever) occur. The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman's life. I'd encourage you to read the book  Forbidden Grief  by Theresa Burke. It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions, and the experiences they have gone through. Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion. (In reality, short of physical force, no one can 'force' you to do something you don't want to do, but things can be said and done to mislead a person --intentionally or otherwise-- into thinking that's what they want themselves.)

We have seen hawthorn maggot flies speciate several times as additional suitable plants have been introduced to the U.S. We have seen strains of laboratory flies speciate several times such that none are able to interbreed with the parent species anymore. We have observed two species of gulls that share a common range and do not interbreed, except that they are the extreme ends of a single population the encircles the world.

1	Thus showing in that analysis which include all possible codes (not only biosynthetically restricted codes) that the genetic code is partially optimal with regards to error minimization. It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code.From article 3The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including:A) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred.B) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information, i.e., information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences.Thus, two more features for which the code is close to being optimal. What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e. the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information.In article nr.4 The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed. The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic (biosynthetically restricted) relationships between amino acids.A few interesting observations can be made:Firstly, from the article:

If it is a bird, why does it have a tail, grastalia, teeth, pre-orbital fenestra, and on and on. If it isn't a bird then why does it have feathers, opposable hallux, pneumatic bones, a furcula, and even a small carina in one specimen? How can creationism explain Archaeopteryx?http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/...graphica_1.jpg

1	Bristol Township, Pennsylvania  From the Times of Trenton of March 13, 2009  Clerk shoots robbery suspect  A knife-wielding robber who entered the Windsor Pharmacy on Wednesday night was taken down by a store clerk using a handgun, police said.  Matthew Perry, a 21-year-old Middletown Township resident, allegedly went into the pharmacy just after 8:30 p.m., displayed a knife, and demanded the pill oxycontin. Police said he began to struggle with a store clerk who resisted him.  A second store clerk, who had a valid permit to carry a weapon, pulled out a handgun and fired one shot at Perry, hitting him in the arm and chest, according to police. Police said Perry fell to the floor, and was taken to a local hospital by the Levittown-Fairless Hills Rescue Squad.  Perry is being guarded by Bristol Township Police, and will be charged pending a review by the Bucks County District Attorney's Office after his release.  **Account originally posted under  New Jersey  due to the source, but it has since been pointed out that Bristol Township is in Pennsylvania.**

1	I'm referring to your comment about the hip replacement wait times. That has nothing to do with Medicare.  If this is the case than you'd be wise to figure out why this is as opposed to blindly assuming universal healthcare is the answer.

It's not something I've spent months on previously and had all possibilities covered: I was wanting others to take a look and see if they found a gaping hole I overlooked.I've gotten your (tentative) agreement, and no counters that actually refute my reasoning, so I may move on, using this as a premise for my next step in a larger 'logical argument'.
1	No. This is just more evidence that Archaeopteryx was a theropod dinosaur. As one of the articles I read stated, this is the nail in the coffin. Some of the characteristics that seemed to be more bird-like in other specimens can be seen to actually be dinosaurian. For good reason were two specimens classified as Compsognathus .
1	That sounds good to me. Although it might be easiest to preserve flow later on it we don't actually mirror each of our posts once comments arrive (and inevitably digress) - just let people quote/cite us from this one if needs be.

Sometimes the oppressor finds in a minority it oppress a mirror of itself. They think it is right to oppress us and see can not see that we have no interest in oppressing them or even revenge for the oppression.

0	nobody said that incest was the same as homosexuality. however, Im sure you would agree that people in incestuous relationships are being socially pressure similar to the gay community a few years ago. so think about it, an incestuous couple cannot legally get married or benefit from any of the rights that homosexuals are protesting for. yet, like gays, their position is that they are consenting adults that are not hurting anyone by their actions. the sanctioning of gay marriages will very likely open the doors for incest marriage. bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments, since their logic is about the same (i.e., not illegal, not hurting anyone else), and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future.  while nobody equated homosexuality to incest, there are grounds of commonality between the 2, and thats what the discussion was about. I hope you see that

1	You are too easily refreshed. Flew is not a biologist, and his assertion that  biologists' investigation of DNA has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved  is one that many biologists would challenge. Essentially, all Flew has concluded is that some Great Unknown Thing is responsible for the existence of life and the universe; and in common with most cultures throughout history he has named that Great Unknown Thing god.  Even if we were to accept this reasoning, the GUT that Flew envisages is a million light years from the anthropomorphic and anthropocentric tyrant-father invoked by the Middle Eastern monotheisms. He has conspicuously omitted from his statements any notion that it is interested in (or even aware of) humankind, let alone that it requires our worship. He does not, you will note, believe in an afterlife.  Professor Flew is entitled to his opinions, as are we all; and his assertion that the level of complexity observed in living organisms requires a non-naturalistic explanation is just that - his opinion. That said, any christian crowing over Flew's 'conversion' is clutching at a pretty slender straw.
1	You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.

1	You mention that the US leads the world in gun violence. Free societies often pay a price as a result of free people making bad decisions.  I would rather live in a country like ours where some people carry guns. If people who lived in Rawanda a few years back had a few guns, I believe they would have prevented thousands of murders and mutilations (inflicted by machetes, btw).
1	Right. We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot investigate the supernatural by natural means. Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R. Miller for example.
1	Walking-fish:  I basically agree with you. I guess I was being redundant in this regard. I was thinking out loud, in cyberspace. But it is interesting that we humans may be the first species to actually go beyond the need for this death &amp; reproduction cycle by genetically or artificially reinventing ourselves. But now I'm thinking out loud again on the web.

1	More misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. This implies that evolution is some kind of progress. That idea is the reason that Darwin objected to the use of the word  evolution  in reference to his theory. Evolution is genetic change in populations over time.
0	Typical little child, all he can offer is condescending insults while never daring to refute the arguments made. But you're in good company as that is all your cohorts can do also. You must reject and denigrate that which is just as reasonable an explanation of the available evidence as your side offers. That's why it's a waste of time going around in circles with you guys. But I've made my point. Again,What is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it. But for you evos to claim victory based on your interpretation which is as biased as ours is, is the epitome of arrogance. We may have to agree to disagree peeling, but don't you dare just assume you're right and the debate is over because you have proven nothing absolutely.

1	Typical YEC misrepresentation. Professor Olsen has no qualms with the concept of evolution- what he does not see is the link between birds and certain theropods. If you think he does not think evolution is correct I suggest you send him an email asking for his views. Here is his address:olsons@si.eduOff course, you might be trying to infer that because their are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant. I disagree, but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within, lets see......... how about Christianity? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable?
1	Gay pride is positive, unlike what these people are doing. Do you have some information regarding a gay rights ad campaign that can be compared to this one?  I laughed when I first saw the ad on MSNBC's Hardball tonight. It shows the fear, insecurities and the fallacies that guide anti-gay equality rights activists.
1	And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology.
1	Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by "friction".By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation.

Sometimes I think they won't be happy until this country becomes a third world country at least techologically and scientifically.
1	We cannot prove the existence of God for, by definition, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe.

1	Well by the Flood, I assume you are refering to the description given in Genesis?Fossils we find today have been attributed to a remarkable variety of environmental settings that allowed them to be preserved. Also, you seem to be refering to the preservation of large animals such as terrestrial vertebrates, which are far rarer than fossils of marine organisms with calcarous skeletons. In that regard, some types of rock are basically one huge fossil as most of their composition is derived from dead animal material.There are just so many different types in which creatures are preserved it is not possible to consider the events within the context of a word like "tragic" Unusual? sometimes. In some cases the word inevitable is the most apt.Also, there are quite a few numbers of ways in which animals have been preserved without the direct involvement of water/sedimentation- terrestrial invertebrates trapped in amber, tarpit "traps" like those of the famous Rancho la Brea with remarkable preservations of ice-age mammal fauna and mummified animals from desert environments (off the top of my head). Plus then you have a whole set of fossils preserved in water conditions where there has been very slow, low energy deposition of sediments, like black shales and the Lithographic limestones of Solnhofen.

1	You obviously misunderstood the question. The question was, "how does one explain evolution?" Instead, what you have offered is the creationist straw man assertion about what evolution is. Of course, evolutionary theory has no more to do with the existence or non-existence of any deity than does physics, chemistry, or even plumbing for that matter. They are all equally "atheistic" in that they do not deal with supernatural deities. All of the above (except plumbing) are investigations of natural phenomena. Science does not study the supernatural because it cannot. It lacks the necessary tools to do so. And until you can quantify your god for us, it will remain that way.And of course, anyone who doesn't lack the integrity to learn at least the basics of what they are arguing against before arguing knows that evolutionary theory doesn't deal with how life, the earth, the universe, or whatever, arose. It seems that you didn't understand the explanations that were offered in this very thread. Evolution deals with how and why heritable chanages in life occur. Evolution deals with heritable changes in populations of organisms. If there are no organisms, then there is no evolution.

1	Except that in some things, Ham and others cannot so judge. Their axioms are, by their lights, not congruent with reality but an accurate description of it. Note two standard responses where there is an apparent incongruity: we've misinterpreted what the bible says*; or, this will all be explained at the end of days.In all other contexts, we'd describe such people as insane, of course. Here we merely deem them pious.* Note that, for the literalists, "firmament" became "expanse" once we knew that the heavens were not a solid object into which stars could be affixed.
1	So although you provide absolutely no evidence or source to back up this claim we should just accept that the memo is authentic until some disproves it? How does such reasoning even begin to make sense?  I'm very suspicious about the legitimacy of such a memo. Here are two bogus quotes attributed to Sarah Brady by some people on the pro-gun side:  People that are willing to make up such quotes would probably also be willing to make up such a memo.
1	Again, your argument doesn't make good sense. First you say a fetus has no chance against someone who wants to kill it. I agree with this. Then you say a child has a chance against someone who wants to kill it...and you base this on the killer's changing his mind because the baby's crying. Where DID you go to school? Haven't you heard of the many shaken-baby-syndrome deaths that occurred because some idiotic person in custody of the child got fed up with the baby's crying? It just wouldn't stop crying, so they killed it.Until a child gets old enough, smart enough and strong enough to outrun or hide from someone trying to kil them, they have no chance of survival. Your argument is all wet.We are separated by reasoning and compassion from the other animals. Theirs is a life based on instinct and a few learned behaviors. For every example you can give me of animals protecting their own young, I can likely present an example where the males (sometimes the females) will kill the young of their species just to keep down the competition. A domestic bitch, when presented with a weakling in a litter of pups, will eat the weakling.

1	Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!  I don't see why we should care how many weapons couldn't be traced back to America even though they came across the border, because it's a moot point. The identifying marks don't exist on them if they can't be traced, meaning the whole thing is a non-issue for everybody except those who have an axe to grind and rights to try and destroy.
1	Contraceptives (for example a condom/ the pill) aren't going to last a month effectively. Then there's the fact that contraceptives, given the above data, can still be 99% effective, as it doesn't mention how many pregnancies they've prevented.What does the writer make of this though? "According to this, condoms have a high failure rate for pregnancy."emoticonXRolleyes 
0	Thats nice...Care to make an argument, or are you just op-eding my viewpoints?
1	No it doesn't. Changes in allele frequencies in a population over time were observed. That is an example of evolution. Evolution isn't something that is "proved." It is observed. Populations of organisms change over time due to the changing frequiencies of genetic make up. That is observed. Evolutionary biology tries to explain the reasons for the observed evolution. In the case of the peppered moth, natural selection due to the predation of birds has been proposed.
1	It's my way of posting a good evolutionist site to the Evolution v Creation forum.  The question merely related to the title of the link.

1	Oh really, what specific rulings by the 1st, 3rd, and 10th circuit courts are you referring to? I've read the rulings by the 1st, 3rd, and 10 circuits courts on the matter and I don't understand what you're talking about. "Appellant, Peter B. Thomas, argues that the City of Portland, Maine, and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Established case law makes clear that the federal Constitution grants appellant no right to carry a concealed handgun. See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) (second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.')"Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland (1st Cir. 1984) "Appellant Raymond Rybar, Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 922(o), which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun.' On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment. Neither challenge is persuasive....In support, Rybar cites, paradoxically, the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge. Rybar draws on that holding, relying on the Miller Court's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' Brief of Appellant at 24-25; Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. Drawing from that language the contra positive implication, Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section(s) 922(o) is clear, a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required, and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment....We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection. In fact, the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself, but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use' and militia related activity....Rybar's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,' as required in Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. "U.S. v. Rybar (3rd. Cir. 1996) "the courts consistently have found no conflict between federal gun laws and the Second Amendment, narrowly construing the latter to guarantee the right to bear arms as a member of a militia...." United States v. Graves (3rd Cir. 1977) "The purpose of the second amendment as stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller, supra at 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, was to preserve the effectiveness and assure the continuation of the state militia."United States v. Oakes (10th Cir. 1977)

1	Actually, the debate on this one was hard to miss 8 or 9 years ago. John Woodmorappe, in his book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, Inst for Creation Research (July 1, 1996), 298 pp., ISBN: 0932766412 did exactly that. Essentially Woodmorappe equated "kinds" to genus in most cases, with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he couldn't make all of them fit. Woody came up with 15,754 "kinds", and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them. He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size. Of course, he leaves off all plants, arthropods, mollusks, fish, and aquatic mammals. I don't recall if he included the dinosaurs, but Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark.You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a "dog king" and a "cat kind" from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood. Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera, not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred. In order to cram all the "kinds" on the ark, creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds (without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year), and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy, calling it "variation in kind."It should also be noted that "John Woodmorappe" is a pen name of Jan Peczkis, a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science. Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe, Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature. At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity (one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department. Radiometric Dating, Paleosols and the Geologic Column). If he consulted a lawyer, I'm sure that he was laughed out of the office, since you can't sue someone for slander if what they say is true.A review of Woodmorappe's book and other interesting links can be found at Talk Origins. You can buy the book at amazon.com for $44.50.
0	how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?  the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23
1	I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. "Evolutionism" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?
1	Oh, I don't know... he could be on to something. Of course, applying his and Kurtz's logic to other situations could explain some other modern day mysteries. For example:From Colson's article:For thirty years I have been going into prisons across America. It has been a wonderful opportunity to share Christ, but it has also been depressing to watch the prison population explode at the same time: When I left prison thirty years ago, there were 239,000 inmates—now there are 2.3 million in America.Clearly, his 30 years of visiting prisons has caused the explosion in the prison population. Maybe is was all the Bible thumping...Ahem.
1	Yes. If this feeder is full, it lasts about a day and 1/2. I've gone through about 6 qts of hummingbird food since Aug 10.
1	However, if you read Genesis 1, it is obvious because of the fact that they repeatedly say 'and it was night and day xxxx', it means literal days. While it could be 'translated' to mean another, the fact 'it was night and it was day on the xxxx day' demonstrates those translations would be dishonest.

1	Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful.  HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&amp;NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the  lots more .  Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)  When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.  As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.  I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next.

1	Actually, his definition of evolution is exactly correct. In fact, I notice that you even acknowledge that he is correct in the last sentence of the paragraph.

1	Darwin spent 20 years after his voyage on the Beagle piling on the evidence for his theory and developing it further before the first Origin publication. He took hundreds of samples of birds from different parts of the world as evidence. He was an avid insect collector - he used those to support his theory. He conducted experiments in his greenhouse. Fossils displayed at the London Natural History Museum were used as evidence for his theory. THAT is how one collects evidence for a theory, not by just inferring that animals and plants are here, so they must have had a designer. There has not been a single piece of evidence for ID that I am aware of - from what I've seen, supporters of ID merely attempt to debunk Darwin's theory - hardly evidence.ID advocates use the eye as evidence for something that's so complex that it couldn't have evolved. In fact, we have a very good idea of how the eye evolved, we can not only see it happen among fetus', but there are plenty of animals alive today that have inferior or primative eyes. Again, this is not evidence for ID, saying 'The eye is complicated, God must have done it".Have you ever read the first edition of Origin of Species? It's completely semantic free. You dont even need to know anything about science or biology to understand it.And I rarely hear evolutionists use terms like "designed for". It's much more terms such as "evolved for" or "adapted to fit". But even so, nature has blindly designed organisms to better suit their environment, so terminology in this case matters not.

1	Again, ecological factors play an important role. If the first birds were aggressive carnivores that attacked other aggressive dinosaurs, this may hold water. Yet their skeletal structure suggest that they were small, agile and light dinosaurs equipped for eating insects and such. The Theropods actually had to gain muscle to provide powered flight which was a later development.  ~Monkey

1	No, they are the same. God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand, just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand. How we came about wasn't as pertinent as why and who, so thats what He told us. It could kinda be like the stork. You know your kids won't understand (and don't yet need to) about sex and child birth, so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents (not all, I know I won't, but SOME do) say that the stork brings babies. They put a myth in place of a fact that the children don't need to know. Furthermore, even if God did explain evolution, if the men He explained it to didn't understand. Which they probably wouldn't have seeing as they had no sense of time, biology, genetics, or even basic anatomy (all pertinent to evolution) then they would have transcribed something VERY different. If God told them "In the beginning I created the Heavens and the Earth in the first billion years, I said let there be light and I caused a tiny powerful ball of matter with an enormous mass to explode and with that came the heavens and the Earth. At first the Earth w" Lets see primitive man wouldnt have understood 'billion years' 'tiny ball of matter with an enormous mass' 'explode.' So what do we have left. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth, He said Let there be Light and there was." I know that isn't the Bible verse, but do you see my point. Even if God didn't as you say 'diliberately' (which in my opinion implies malice, but you may use that word in reference to God if you wish to do so) keep the information from us. In the minds of man it could have been simplified enormously to a point of mythological proportions. A modern day example would be the theory of relativity. Have you ever had it explained to you. I have. It is extremely complicated and few people REALLY understand it. Anyway, when my father explained it to me when I was about 16, we talked about it for several hours (literally) and through all his complicated explanations and answers to my questions, my brain pretty much reduced it to "As you approach the speed of light time slows down compared to things not going that fast. But that does not mean when you slow back down you will not return to their same 'time.' Time IS relative." Now I still don't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light, or even how you would return to their same 'time.' I can simply regurgitate the facts. Man back then wouldn't have understand evolution so it would have been simplified similarly. Simplify it to just the facts, ignore the how and put it into a time frame that you can understand and thats good enough.

1	The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK. emoticonXGood

1	I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!
1	Well that's just like a good darwinist to make a ridiculous challenge. What I can show, however, is that thoughts, emotions and social settings can re-express genes, which can lead not only to a change in phenotype, but also to new, heritable traits passed down to future generations. You guys' hypothesis that it takes a new or changed gene for  evolution  (ie..change in population over time) to take place is unsupported, unscientific, un-proven -- and ultimately wrong.

You are completely void of the ability to recognize that we have lost our way morally speaking as a people, and are running to destruction with our fingers in our ears as a civilization. We traditionalists understand very well that we either rise or fall together as a people which is why we still oppose what you represent. But we don't do it to oppress you at all, we do it to preserve our Nation because God will surely lift His hand from protecting us as we abandon Him and His values which you humanists have worked so hard to erase.

1	Collecting on the 150 year-old debt for assisting their rebellion against their lords and masters....
1	Good.  The moment someone starts  believing  in evolution is the moment they cease following the scientific path.  Evolution does not require belief at all- it requires an appraisal of available information and a logical analysis of how well the theory fits the evidence. If that theory is sound (as our example here is) then we can accept it as being a sound description of the evidence we have.
0	Why should your belief of that being the case take precedent over the belief that that is not the case?  What gives you (or any group) the right to impose your views on other people, directly affecting their rights, simply for an idea you have of  ideals  that not eveybody agrees with?
1	And yet the article is about a legal matter.
1	And this:"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; ensure justice for those who are perishing." Proverbs 31:8Also...Exodus 2122 "If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.1) If a woman gives birth prematurely, but there is no serious injury--i.e. the baby lives without harm, then a fine results to compensate for the assault.2) If a woman gives birth prematurely, and the baby dies, then the assailant is to be given the death penalty. This point is HUGE!!! What God is saying here is that the value and worth of an adult man is equal to the value and worth of an unborn fetus who was young enough, or injured enough, to die. God equates the loss of an unborn baby as the loss of a life, for He says, "you are to take life for life,..." This point cannot be emphasized too strongly. God considers the unborn baby alive, and the loss of that life is considered murder. This murder is punishable with the death penalty. This verse demonstrates three truths:a) The unborn's life is equivalent in value to an adult's life in God's sightb) This also outlines God's Law against criminal feticide. c) The killing of the unborn is murder Bible and abortion : The Biblical case against abortion

The author here either does not believe this and is intentionally misrepresenting his opponents, or he is grossly misinformed about evolution, or both.

0	The truth is, his nation is even worse than those he condemns. Why he tries to hide the truth is beyond belief!! The only unarmed people in Eurasia are the law abiding ones and he thinks this is a good thing? Pure evil!!
0	Wait, did you really ask a question imply an answer and then condemn someone for it? Haha, your logic may be more delusional than I thought.
0	And? What relevance does this have to PP today?
1	True, God created Adam, then he created Eve out of one of Adam's ribs. All in one day.
1	But your own link says that the rise in crime was partially explained by the new system the UK police were using for recording crime and that the British Crime Survey showed a decrease in crime since 1997.
1	Apparently taking guns away from law-abiding citizens would prevent 500,000 guns a year from winding up in the hands of criminals.
1	In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with. Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities. For example, Scalia stated in Heller: "Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion. I've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms. So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions. It is an example of judicial lawmaking.
1	well, whatever the case may be, that baby has a full function nervous system and can feel the pain whenever it is aborted. Does that not disturb you? People always tend to think "oh the mother is going to go through pain" BLA BLA BLA.. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABY THAT IS BEING TORTURED TO DEATH? cmon.
1	The Brady Bill does not lower crime:http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/284/5/585A little dated, 1997, but also note that both Cook and Ludwig were both anti-gunners."Brady Law Proponents: Ludwig, Cook, JAMA Among Lott's harshest critics have been anti-self-defense academics Professors Jens Ludwig and Philip J. Cook. In a study funded by the anti-self-defense Joyce Foundation and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) they set out to debunk Lott's findings regarding the Brady law. There was just one problem: they couldn't. "http://rpc.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/gc083100.htm
1	Cite your source, preferably online, so that it can be found easily. Of course, this is like you asking for an example of tests done on animals (I assume that you mean vertebrates). Mutations can be harmful and often are, except when a selective pressure is exerted. In those cases, some mutations become helpful, and those reproduce. Please research your claims.
0	NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children.As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.I would also add one more lisencing rule8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence.
1	Bertvan: Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis proposes that living individual organisms, not their genomes, respond to internal and environmental challenges, intelligently and purposefully, that such adaptations are inherited epigenetically, as they develop, and the phenotype only instigates a reorganization of its genome to reflect such adaptations if they persistent over many generations.
0	So you're saying that the rationale behind this vast conspiracy being executed by people who allegedly don't believe in hell... is to send people to hell? Pretty self-refuting, don't you th-- er, no, you don't think at all, do you?
1	It seems to be the reason for crafting this new, individual right against the States. Since the original purpose of the Second Amendment doesn't appear to be needed, there is a new use that is protected.
0	Great site! I know I'll refer to it in the future. Thanks.
1	Sickness is all in the eye of the beholder, what I find sick you may well not and I think we have seen that I find things acceptable that you don't. I will not condemn any of it however unless it actually causes harm.  Oh I quite agree. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to see it as such. I was admitting to those who don't that it does appear that God confirms their homosexual prejudices.  To back Traveler up however, I don't buy the 'closet case' answer myself. People who are racist aren't secretly scared they are black, equally homophobes aren't necessarily closet homosexuals. Unfortunately such irrational prejudices just exist.
1	Really? So suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. You measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. In ten years you make actual measurements. The predictions of the first model for Mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. The second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (For comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- I may be wrong about this). So, are you saying the first model is wrong? The error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). What about the second?
1	if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily. If they are produced from human minds, and human minds are mutually contradictory, then how can the constructs be absolute? Therefore, the laws of logic are not human constructs.
1	I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.  Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.  You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth.
1	Which issues? The health issues? Pregnancy does not physically impact the health of men. Ever. They don't get pregnant.
1	Thou shalt not commit adultery. I'm to lazy to look for anyone dealing with premaritial sex. Adultery and premaritial sex are sin, because God says not to participate in them.
1	You got it wrong Daewoo. The ban was put in place by the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act, designed to correct the erronius Gun Control Act of 1968. The machinegun ban provision was slipped in at the last minute, during a time when those that would oppose it weren't there to debate it.
1	Besides, evolution has relatively few holes. A fair percent of it has actually been proven in the natural and artifical worlds.
0	No, in other words "the cut and thrust of peer review." Where ID falls flat on its face. Stop trying to dress that up as some kind of underserved mugging; if you aren't prepared to understand and defend ID on a scientific level you aren't equipped to decide that it is being unfairly treated.
0	Since when does the word  access  get translated into  must perform ?  Women should have access to all medical diagnostic tests that can help them throughout their pregnancy. They should have access to sonagrams, CAT Scans, EKGs, EEGs, MRIs, blood tests, X-rays, etc., None of these are forced procedures or tests now. While I haven't read the actual text of the legislation, I would find it unfathomable that any legislator would force a woman into a medical procedure.
1	Actually, if you bothered to pay any attention whatsoever, it actually goes against your point entirely. Just because WSM and I were both in "heterosexual" Style relationships, doesn't change the fact that both of us are indeed homosexuals and therefore proves that homosexuals do indeed have children, planned or not. Mine too was kind of a suprise. I was on the "pill" but was also taking antibiotics at the time and for anyone who doesn't already know, antibiotics will completely cancel out the affects of the birth control pill. I was NOT aware of this at the time and low-and-behold I ended up pregnant with my son. p.s. just for general information, I was not taking "the pill" for birth control reasons. Not all women who are prescribed it are even sexually active at all. The birth control pill contains synthetic or naturally dirived female hormones, which for some women aids them in attaining a more regular period. Many women atheletes are prescribed birth control because being extremely athletic can disrupt, postpone or completely do away with a woman's natural cycle. Taking birth control helps to "normalize" female hormone levels. Such was my case.
0	well if you think the sun goes around the earth then its time for apocalypse.
0	Well, I wish I could change your view.  Perhaps some pictures of babies at say... 6 weeks or so would convince you that they're a person? I mean, maybe it won't change you're mind about them being a person till they're born, but perhaps the fact that they look like babies may make you think differently?
0	sure, whatever the mother chooses.
0	Liberals love big Gov't. They can't do anything for themselves so they want to rely on the Gov't for everything. Ahhhh you smell that, smells like communism to me.

1	The first article is from 2002 and the second one is from 2006, molecular genetics changed massively over that period of time with the completition of the human genome project and the development of new technology. What they would be looking at and comparing would have changed drastically as well, from just the genes in the first case (the 99% figure) and everything in the second (94%).

1	A liberal mainstream media doesn't exist...simply because it is not profitable to the select few mega-billion dollar corporations who own most of the mainstream media outlets here in America.  There is only a corporate media. Not liberal, not all that conservative.

1	Yes, they are correct. They are also responsible for the various other things like the recent Minnesota bridge collapse, HurricaneKatrina, and many other things. God is punishing his messed-up nation, trying to get us to move from our moral corruption and perversion.
0	no, that's not what I mean. It's not like it's fine to kill anything. I'm not going to walk up to someone in a coma and kill them just because they can't control their actions and think as good as everyone else. It's just better than walking up to a person walking down the road and stabbing them in the back. It's just if you got pregnant 'cause of rape or something, don't you think it would be better toget an abortion when the baby can't really think, etc. I know it's still bad, but it's better. That's all I think she's trying to say, and if not, that's what I say. I mean, if a 12 year old got pregnant 'cause someone raped her, don't you think she should get an abortion, and the earliest the better?
1	Ah. Johnathan Wells is an evangilcal YEC who got his education in Biology to "disprove" evolution. He rejects science at all levels. I would not take serioiusly anybody associated with the 'discovery institute'. Mr Wells does have the advantage of having a better education that most of them, but his degree was gotten to promote Young Earth Creationism, and was paid for by Sun Yen Moon. I would say that the review is a bit high level, but accurate.

1	So although you provide absolutely no evidence or source to back up this claim we should just accept that the memo is authentic until some disproves it? How does such reasoning even begin to make sense?I'm very suspicious about the legitimacy of such a memo. Here are two bogus quotes attributed to Sarah Brady by some people on the pro-gun side:
1	There have been several conducted by the department of justice.
1	UK Civil Partnerships are not identical to marriage. There are a few small differences (and a heck of a lot more pages for the law books) because CPs are an entirely new entity. Most of the differences are minor, though I, and quite a few gay people in the UK, find one particularly insulting. CPs CANNOT have any religious component. Unlike heterosexual marriages which can be  completed  in a church by having someone  proclaim  them, CPs take effect upon the second signature, have no  proclamation  requirement, and cannot be  performed  in a church (though I guess nothing stops people from signing a document in a church).  It's a sop to the religious right and has quite a few religious folks angry that the government is seeking to dictate what can and cannot happen in a church.  more details:  http://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/lgbt/faq.htm  http://www.pinkweddings.biz/thelaw.htm#b  http://www.equalitycoalition.org/pressrelease.asp?ID=4  Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one.
1	And just what is the number of "real scientists" that acknowledge the good science behind creationist claims? And why is it that over 99% of the biologists in the U.S. accept evolution and reject classic creationism? You make statements that are patently untrue.......

0	Just like when you have an abortion, it cleans out your uterous so you can have another baby if you wish.
1	Under the illogical view of the 14th amendment that currently occupies our court system there is nothing more about it than convincing 5 judges that it isn't immoral. Let's not pretend this is anything related to what the amendment actually says because we both know it isn't.
1	You are correct, but bear in mind it is just Bragg's introduction to the programme and not the opinion of the panel. This issue is explored in more detail when Dawkins talks about a population of self replicating molecules (27:00) and how the first life, as we define it would have arisen when there was concentration of these molecules and then the first cells- there is no suggestion of a single entity that was responsible for all subsequent life.  Thanks for the links on the articles btw.
1	It hasn't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals.
0	Actually looking back I wish I hadn't posted a lot of what is on those websites. It is a lot of poor arguments and I'm glad I was able to realize that over the last 3 months.  Had I already decided to believe that all of it was true I wouldn't be here debating you now.  You say I don't want to know. I wonder if you would want to know if God didn't exist. Is that why at the end of your post you seem so unhappy to debate this further?
0	As much as it pains me I'm going to agree with Mathew here. If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want. If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.  Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government.

1	A lot of people say that Jesus is the son of God. Others say that Jesus was actually God Himself, who came to Earth. Whichever way is the real case, Jesus didn't need to carry anything, because God had the ability to wipe two cities off the face of the map by raining down fire and brimstone.  God has plenty of firepower at His disposal. And He never said  lay down and die because it's wrong to protect yourselves from harm. 
0	Yes, we want to teach that it's acceptable to be gay. You obviously have a problem with that. What lesson would you wish to teach? Would you wish to teach that it's not acceptable, that it is wrong, worthy of prejudice and marginalization? Would you pretend it doesn't exist, realizing that it does exist, meaning you are still forced to acknowledge what it is you don't permit speaking of, i.e.,  the love the name of which dare not be spoken ? That is still teaching that love as something negative.  Further, heterosexuality is taught and talked about, and you don't consider that indoctrination. I'd say you wish to indoctrinate heterosexism and homophobia?
0	Well, if my points in this thread are so easy to refute then why do you focus on addressing arguments made in another thread? I'm not fooled by anyone who claims to have a winning hand but won't show others his cards.
0	Because nobody could be anymore fraudulent than your own Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center, right?  Simply because you call our sources frauds doesn't mean they are, Brady. They're accurate whether you like them or not. Meanwhile the VPC is slowly dying off, losing more and more members each day, and slipping into obscurity.
0	That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X.
1	I think we are talking about different things. A belief in adam and eve is not the same as being a good christian. The disbeleif in adam and eve cannot DIRECTLY be used as a excuse to murder. Also did hitler talk about anything else other than keeping bloodlines pure? Because these ideas to rely on the main theme of darwins origin of the species, in your quote you show how darwin states that eugenics is just an obvious consequence of the facts of animal husbandry.
1	But what is adultery?  Mark 10:11:  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.  Matthew 19:9:  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance. According to Mark, all putting away is adultery, but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him. Which is it?
1	I've added one now. It's the first result if you google 'Creation: where's'. It's also the top article in AiG's 'Get Answers' section, which is linked directly from the navigation bar on their front page.
1	Actually it does. Gangbangers and other criminals aren't allowed to possess firearms. Having an unregistered firearm is illegal in California. You need a license to own a handgun in California. Transporting an uncased, loaded firearm in California is a crime. Carrying a concealed weapon without a nearly impossible to get permit is a crime. Open carry of a loaded weapon is a crime. If the governor doesn't show some backbone then soon the open carry of an unloaded firearm will also be a crime.All of these acts are crimes. Plenty for the police to arrest the people doing the drive by shootings, plenty of offenses to file charges on. The police have all the tools they'd need for keeping the people of California safe, and yet California still has the highest number of drive by shootings in the entire nation.Wise up. Gun control laws are doing nothing to protect anyone. And if they were helping take "guns off the streets" and "out of the hands of the bad guys" then this high number wouldn't have happened.
1	Well, we really don't know. However we do know that the woman has self conscious, and feels pain. Something the fetus lacks. She also can interact with other human beings, and develop relationships and attachments. Another thing the fetus lacks. Phisically, she is larger and much more capable than the fetus, and has a formed brain. Another thing the fetus lacks.  In conclusion, we really don't know. But, we do know that the woman can do, feel, and become more than a fetus is.
1	When was the last time there was ever a mass murder at a gun range full or armed patrons? Or an International Practical Shooting Confederation match? Or any of our shooting sports that people come from all over the world to take part in?  If the  gun culture of America  is truly to blame for all these campus massacres, how come none of the shooters ever seem to be members of the NRA, or took part in a hunter's safety course, or anything else along those lines?
1	Well for what it's worth, the police prefer to use AR-15 Carbines, MP-5 9mms, and either Mossberg or Remington 12ga when they are serving a no-knock warrant on your house (or the wrong house next door) in the middle of then night. And the AK may be a bit much for home use, as the 7.62 would way over-penetrate the walls and hit the neighbors houses (or the neighbors.) Hope that helped.
1	Although I'm not keen on them describing things as living fossils (the term is misleading) the possibilities and implications of this are fascinating. I'd be interested to see the paper if anyone has a PDF. It would seem to suggest that the origins of this particular molecule go back to the Ordovician at least, prior to the reptile/mammal split. Anyway, thought people might be interested
1	I agree with you to some extent. First, the Mr. Hayes was convicted of this crime before the Lautenberg Amendment was passed. Secondly, Virginian law (where the case originates from) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship (that which he was tried and convicted of) and between the agressor.Quote majority ruling:A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a §922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense. Pp. 4–13.Bulldung.If congress wanted to make it simpler they would have just said battery instead of domestic violence. How the heck they came up with that is beyond me. They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment, which is a big NO NO! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent.Quote Justice Roberts dissent:That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under §922(g)(9).....The majority also points out that interpreting “commit-ted by” to modify the “use” of force would render the word“committed” superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading “committed by” to modify “offense” has its own flaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading. The majority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the statutory language reflects “less-than-meticulous drafting” and “syntactical awkwardness,” and “is not a model of the careful drafter’s art.” Ante, at 6, 12, 13. I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous.Which is why this law needs to be rewritten.There is a lot more, but I find the majority decision hard to believe. It just doesn't make sense (well to me that is.)BTW, this by no means I support Domestic Violent offenders, etc. On the contrary, I believe they should lose their gun rights if convicted of domestic violence, BUT, this decision is wrong. The pieces do not fit together. That is Mr. Hayes was convicted of battery, not domestic violence. The government screwed up, so he should be walking free right now.

1	No. In 1996 there was a shooting massacre in Port Arthur, in the countries south. The new government had just been voted in, and it was their first act, right on the back of this massacre, to tighten gun laws up significantly. Riding on the back of public horror at the massacre, it was rushed through, approved by both the upper and lower houses, and made law.

1	As attmept to make things more clear if darwin did not exist and it was hitler who proposed the idea of Macroevolution I would think it would be a totally reasonable claim. I cannot see how the beleif in macroevolution is cleary wrong or causes you to shove people into ovens.
0	All of that sounds a lot like Deism.   Personally, if I was somehow FORCED to believe in a religion, based on what I currently know of the lot, it would be Deism.
1	Yes it was. The Noachian flood did not occur. Ignoring the obvious impossibilities of the ship/animals/etc, we see that the results a global flood would have caused do not exist.
1	Without a doubt Peter is my favorite in the NT.Acts 2 is a shocking turn of events, when on the day of Pentecost 3,000 believed in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah, and were saved and received the power of the Holy Spirit.Truly God used the lowest and most worthless and in Peter's lowest, God used the occassion for the highest Good. And, at the end of his life, he asked to be cruicified upside down (a merciful request, BTW) - who could make this scenario up?Why would 3,000 Jews believe in a dead Messiah? Why was the tomb empty? If Jesus was not the Messiah, who could believe the Gospel?Why would anyone risk being a Jewish heretic, and being cast out of Jerusalem? Acts 7 if memory serves me, or 8,9 as the believers in "The Way" - Jews for Jesus as it were, were expelled from Jerusalem.Some did stay behind with James, who was later beheaded 40 - 50 A.D. or so. More for tomorrow.......L8r, Rich
1	Yes and no  Yes and no  Yes and no  All are saved as there is no hell  Would you kill or burn your child if they did these things? what part of unconditional love and love without end do you not understand?  Faith is enough  That just it you don't have to do anything. Grace can not be given or taken away by anything you do or don't do.  And he said,  Let me tell you a secret about a father's love,  A secret that my daddy said was just between us.   He said,  Daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.   --- George Straight
0	Just looking at the REAL issues of abortion, Maineiac. Do you have a problem with that?
0	** It's up to you. Stop bringing up red herrings and/or arguing by personal attack, or don't expect me to treat your posts with any less contempt than I have for most of what's been posted to this board.
1	Do the Christians that you know that believe in evolution, believe that there was no first man named Adam, or that there was no Genesis flood? The term "evolution" needs to be narrowed down - more clearly defined, for these discussions.
1	We often have debates in our Sixth Form (College), but I have also attended several "debate camps" - each a weekend long. I also attended a day at oxford which was made up of a few formal debates and just a bit of teaching on Philosophy and Classics. Apart from that - I have been on debate forums for quite some time, and I've gained experience from there too.
1	Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin. There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see. Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not!!!! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point. Guess not though.
0	I think the answer to that is much like J.P. Morgan's famous retort when someone asked him how much his yacht cost. 'If you have to ask, you can't afford it'. I'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons couldn't afford them, but if the interest isn't already there, it's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question.
0	Actually, my wife and I discuss evolution all the time. She's an evolutionary biologist. She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show, just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said. She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity. Which I totally understand.
0	She had plenty of choice in the matter. She should have chosen to keep the kid. Even if she lost all her money because of this it would have been the right thing to do.
1	Because there's absolutely no due process in this proposal. Your name is on the list, your rights are revoked. That's not due process. There's no court of law, no trial, no verdict, no attorneys, no chance for the accused to defend themselves, etc.  We still haven't forgotten the Homeland Security memo that said veterans and those opposed to abortion could be potential terrorists.
1	I believe you've missed the point. He's not against evolution; change of species over time into other species. He in fact, from what I can gather, does indeed believe in evolution  He's arguing that it didn't come about through materialistic processes.
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.
0	Great site! I know I'll refer to it in the future. Thanks.
0	No problem. I personally believe killing innocent children is wrong. Yet, I also believe that a woman's decision to murder her child is between her and her god. I wouldn't remove individual choice. It's not mine to make.  But this isn't the right forum for that.  Back to the OP: False dichotomy, or obfuscation and refusal to answer the stated question?
1	Shotguns are used for hunting.BB guns aren't useful when robbing a store as they're too 'weak'.I see no legal use handguns can fulfil, although I'm fairly neutral on banning them, if the country is already saturated with them. I don't see what it's going to achieve; the people who will mis-use the guns already have them. If there were no handguns in Canada I would support the ban, but as presumably there are already lots, I don't think the ban's a great idea.-Wez
1	I think the point that can safely be made to all of you defenders of atheism and the Governments that practice it is that all of the people who have wrongly died at the hands of the corrupt Popes and the RCC throughout history in the name of Christ don't come close to the deaths caused by the Godless dictators who practiced genocide as shown by ChristAscended. That is the point he is making and that point stands.
0	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.  I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.
0	And people are punished for that, and their service record is going to make clear they did it. I feel that if someone has a service record that gives no indication he or she would discriminate, there is no reason they should be asked questions about their ideological views.

It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism.

If a girl cannot be tested for a STD without parental notification and she does not wish her parents to know she had sex (or fears their wrath), she may not go in for testing.  In general, knowing whether you have a STD is a good thing.

1	I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.  The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the  I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me .  So yes, I  a real pro-choicer  agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type.
0	While your story is a sad one I disagree that you should be happy with having a  second chance . I believe this because you gave your unborn child no chance.  I probably shouldn't say  you  because it seems like you didn't have a choice in the matter.  Anyway, thank you for sharing your story and welcome to the forums.
1	The one thing Dobson can't answer logically relates to incest and rape. Why? This is a matter for the victim to deal with. . . .not the infallable law of the bible. It's always interesting to me that the bible thumpers refuse to look at abortion other than through religious, save the fetus, eyes and yet, are ready to KILL the sicko's of society when they have committed a haneous crime. Too many "thumpers" don't read all of bible.And yet the same bible states:Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life. If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. -- Exodus 21:22-23 The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old. And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6 Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons. Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16 God sometimes approves of killing fetuses. And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 (Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.) Your bible, not mine. Maybe Dobson needs to read a bit more of his bible rather than condeming others. Isn't he supposed to be a psychologist? What's his expertise in biblical literature?I think we all need to read a bit more before we critize how others live.
1	The thing is, Bush didn't live in Canada.
1	Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.
1	This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering.
1	Because of the history of it. Well, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school.
1	Hmm, I wonder why Asian scientists and businesses are going so great guns into emryonic stem cell research?  Those folks in Asia seem to be lots smarter in business than we Americans -- as witnessed by the number of Asian-made cars and other products that are purchased all over the world.
1	Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function.
1	And that is why there is no plutonium found in the natural (fossil) fission reactors discovered in Oklo, Gabon in Africa.A fission reaction in the presence of U-238 always produces plutonium. In fact, about 1/3 of the energy output from a typical reactor in the U.S. comes from the fission of plutonium-239 that is created by the fission of U-235. When there is not enough fissionable material left in the fuel to sustain a reaction, there always remains several isotopes of plutonium that were not present in the original enriched uranium fuel.
1	No, that isn't what I mean at all. But leave it you guy's to once again misinterpret what I did mean. You consistently lose all credibility when you defend and even fight to support lies and deceit.
1	There aren't any. The chances of the father getting custody of a child are right above zero.

0	And you did a quite poor job at it too.
1	I see myself as just as capable of swinging from being responsibile, safe and trustworthy into irresponsible, dangerous and untrustworthy. I believe every humans possess the ability to to do so, but not nessesarily through the involvement of firearms.Although i must reiterate the words "responsibility, dangerous and trustworthy" are entire being of a subjective, circumstantial situation.
0	I never said you had to be armed, you merely cannot deprive me of my right to be armed, which is the nature of gun control. Your counterpoint was not reflective of my words.
0	No problem. Let's start that dialog now. What are the logical reasons for banning gay marriage?
1	I think the reason for the differences in translations is because the translations i think are geared more to audience. There are easier translations for little kids and those who have a hard time with bigger words. Another thing that has to be taken into account is that it is not always easy to translate exactly from one language to another. Some English words have several equivalents in other languages so the differences in the translations come from which equivalent was chosen by the translators.  P.S. This of course is not to argue with what the person stated above.
0	That's right, a higher view of the fetus than there currently is typically in our culture. I have no problem with anyone referring to it that way.
1	So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?
1	Yes I do, but because of time restraints and for lack of a better example that everyone could relate to and understand I used it. There are plenty of good examples of where people believe one thing was true while - infact - something else was true, so the point still stands. A better example (that I probably should have used instead) is that people used to believe that the Earth was the center of the universe, etc. etc.
0	Precisely, the only people who submit to strict gun control are the honest ones who, once disarmed, are then destined to become victims of those who have no respect for the laws anyway.
1	Nice raising the bar. Fallacies are a creationist's best friend. You claimed:"have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure."Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes (which are proteins) don't count.
1	And there you have hit the nail on the head; there are both good and P-poor parents out there. Each case should be taken on its own merits; it's dam tough to make one rule fit all. Impossible, actually.
0	Black panthers?  MLK died before Heston was NRA presdent?  Heston ran for office?  A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to  win  an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of  reasoning  has the following form:  1. Topic A is under discussion.  2. Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).  3. Topic A is abandoned.  Either connect the dots or shut up!
1	Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.
1	Actually they can't ever get pregnant.
1	Yes, of course the past can never be proven.But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)

0	For the record, to interested parties reading -- subscribers to evolutionary biology or creationism -- I subscribe to evolutionary biology and having that taught in the public school system. And though I disagree with creationism, I support parents' right to teach their children creationism. For further information, please see the poll discussion.
1	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?

The specimens are the first examples of fossilized bone marrow ever to be discovered. They are so well preserved that the original color of the tissue is still visible. "The marrow is organically preserved," McNamara said. "The original color of the marrow is preserved.Like modern frogs, she says, the bones show an inner zone of yellow, fatty marrow, encircled by an outer zone of red marrow."or this:Fossil Meat Found in 380-Million-Year-Old Fishhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...-tissue_2.htmlthis is a pretty good trick for a creature that is over a third of a billion years old!

1	Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.
1	Recent news about an old theory. This is, of course, and example of macroevolution that is not the accumulation of small genetic changes of microevolution.  Mysterious microbe retrofits itself with plant  Flagellate might be study in evolution  But ender_krum's difficulty with micro and macro evolution is quite understandable. I can well understand how someone can jog to the end of the block, but are they not, after all on the same street? What I can't understand is how someone can finish a marathon. It seems impossible that lots of little steps could carry anyone that far.
0	You revel in those beliefs, certainly - and not surprising either. All these miracles, and others, embody the personally comforting notion that for special people, the universe makes exceptions. This is a common feature of religions, from the oldest to the newest, ever since we were first intelligent enough to appreciate at a conscious level that there were things in the world we didn't understand and couldn't control and which didn't seem to care very much about us, like lightning or crocodiles. As members of a species who have evolved the habit of ingratiating ourselves with other, more powerful members by making the right sounds and employing properly deferential body language, the idea of being able to employ the same techniques to get the uncaring forces of nature on your side is a powerfully seductive one. Certainly it's more palatable than believing that sometimes the crocodile is already full when you happen to take a dip, and sometimes it is not.Gotta go, back later.
1	Read to the very end of the verse. "If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her."

1	It should be noted that other exotic amino acids are also used by a few other codes (derived form the original). E.g. Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded for in many archaea and vertebrates. Archaea, however seem to be the most primitive organisms, thus these encoded amino acids must have been fixated early on.Thus an interesting question can be applied to an "evolving" code as posited in the above quote:Are these "still evolving" mRNAs, still evolving? Or did it hit an inevitable global optimum? Secondly, from the article:
0	emoticon_xgood I think we all could live with this.
1	o_c hit the nail on the head. The intent is to encourage sexual responsibility. The problem is that this is what Planned Parenthood does. These numbskull protesters have their idea of what sexual responsibility is: abstinence outside of marriage. The problem is that this is a pipe dream; you won't stop people from having sex using threats and scare tactics. Instead, the only thing this fearmongering accomplishes is scaring people into being caught with contraceptives by authority figures, so they don't have any... but they still have sex. Contrastingly, PP encourages proper and effective contraception and sexual health.Only an idiot can't see which one goes farther toward preventing the abortions that those XXXXXX are protesting in the first place.
1	Still it is a good example for a flaw in our body that God wouldn't have put there for any good reason other than to cause pain and death in the unfortunate few.
0	That is your belief. You've no evidence provided other than it is just your belief.
1	First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said "They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.
0	Oh yes, just look at all the evidence present in this post. Yeesh.BTW, if ID has nothing to do with religion, why, when asked a question about ID did you immediately bring up the Noachian flood?EDITYou apparently posted while I was writing my reply.

1	This is a very interesting post. You show a lot of knowledge and insight.It is quite long and I don't think I understood all of it. Could you mention what is the most important point?You make a good point that "evolution is merely an illusion." I am thinking about this and I want to ask you what you see as the ramifications from this. Looking forward to seeing more of your posts.
0	In other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law. Admit it.
1	Well not exactly, but it does come down to  biblical creationism  without the courage to admit that it is a son of  biblical creationism . At least the biblical creationists (YEC and OECs) were sufficiently honest to identify their candidate for the creator/designer. IDers cannot seem to recall who the designer might be - they like most laywers take the fifth amendment.
1	Fossils aren't fake Mutz, the ages that the fake scientists attribute to them are, see what I mean ? :) And the petrified wood structure that exists on Mt Ararat is pretty impressive evidence that something big and made of wood is way up on the side of a mountain, and no one can figure why or how it got there other than by way of Noah's flood. And here's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations Theologians consider, both conservative and liberal.http://www.grisda.org/origins/22058.htmBIBLICAL EVIDENCE FOR THEUNIVERSALITY OF THE GENESIS FLOODRichard M. DavidsonJohn Nevin Andrews Professor of Old Testament InterpretationOld Testament DepartmentAndrews University, Berrien Springs, MichiganOrigins 22(2):58-73 (1995). WHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUTThe extent of the Genesis Flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars. For those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive, twenty-four-days, a universal Flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column. The thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal, universal, world-wide Genesis Flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data. The author summarizes twenty-two lines of biblical evidence — including terminological, thematic, contextual, grammatical-syntactical, literary-structural, logical-conceptual, theological, canonical, and typological which support the universality of the Genesis Flood.PLEASE NOTE: Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the Hebrew transliteration. Our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I. Conflicting Schools of InterpretationOne of the most controversial aspects of the Flood narrative concerns the extent of the Genesis Flood. Three major positions are taken: (1) the traditional, which asserts the universal, world-wide, nature of the Deluge; (2) limited or local flood theories, which narrow the scope of the Flood story to a particular geographical location in Mesopotamia; and (3) non-literal (symbolic) interpretation, which suggests that the Flood story is a non-historical account written to teach theological truth.Against this third position, the non-historical, we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the Flood. In the literary structure of the Flood story (see Shea 1979), the genealogical frame or envelope construction (Genesis 5:32 and 9:28-29) plus the secondary genealogies (Genesis 6:9-10 and 9:18-19) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history. The use of the genealogical term tôledôt ("generations," "account") in the Flood story (6:9) as throughout Genesis (13 times, structuring the whole book), indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of Genesis (Doukhan 1978, p 167-220). Walter Kaiser analyzes the literary form of Genesis 1-11 and concludes that this whole section of Genesis must be taken as "historical narrative prose" (Kaiser 1970).A number of references in the book of Job may allude to the then-relatively-recent Flood (Job 9:5-8; 12:14-15; 14:11-12; 22:15-17; 26:10-14; 28:9; 38:8-11; see Morris 1988, p 26-30). The historical occurrence of the Flood is part of the saving/judging acts of God, and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing Flood typology (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327); more on this point later.Thus according to the biblical writers, far from being a non-historical, symbolical, or mythical account written only to teach theological truths, the Flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real, literal, historical event.For evangelical Christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the Flood account, the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local, limited flood or a universal, world-wide cataclysm.The limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological, biological, and anthropological problems for a universal flood. (See Boardman 1990, p 212-223; Custance 1979, p 28-58; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Mitchell 1982/1993; Ramm 1954, p 232-249; Young 1977, p 171-210). Since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article, I can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable, although much more study is needed. A number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long-age geology (see Coffin and Brown 1983; Roth 1985, 1986a, 1988; Whitcomb 1988; Baumgardner 1994a,b).The local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the Flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense. The various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality; they are seen to indicate universality within the writer's world-view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view. (See Boardman 1990, p 223-226; Custance 1979, p 15-27; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Ramm 1954, p 241-242.) We will take up this issue in the next section of this article.The traditional conservative understanding of the Flood narrative is that Genesis 6-9 describes a universal, world-wide Deluge. It should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal-critical commentators on Genesis 6-9, although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ANE accounts and not historical. (See Hasel 1975, p 78 and Note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position: Fohrer, Koehler, Noth, Procksch, Skinner, Sarna, Speiser, von Rad, Vriezen, Zimmerli, etc. Some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article.)The thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal, universal world-wide Flood does full justice to the biblical data, and this universal interpretation is crucial for Flood theology in Genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers.II. Biblical Terminology in Genesis 6-9 Indicating UniversalityPerhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal Flood is the specific all-inclusive terminology found within the Genesis account itself. The late Gerhard Hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of Origins (Hasel 1974, 1975, 1978), and therefore I need not go into detail in this article. Eight different terms or phrases in Genesis 6-9, most echoing their counterparts in the world-wide creation account of Genesis 1-2, indicate universality.First, the term haÉares "the earth," occurring 46 times in the Flood narrative (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, etc.), always without any accompanying genitive of limitation, clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world-wide, universal creation in Genesis 1:1, 2, 10. (While the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain "land," the explicit link to creation in the Flood account (see especially Genesis 6:6, 7) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in Genesis 6-9.)Some have argued that if Moses had wished to indicate the entire world, he would have used the Hebrew term tebel, which means the world as a whole, or dry land in the sense of continents. This word is never used in the Flood narrative. But it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire Pentateuch, including the creation account. In fact, the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the Hebrew Bible, but only in poetic texts (39 times) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haÉares "the earth." Thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology, and carries little weight.A second expression, "upon the face of all the earth" Ìal-penê kol-haÉares (Genesis 7:3; 8:9), clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation (Genesis 1:29; cf. Genesis 1:2 for a related universal expression), and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension, i.e., the entire surface of the global mass. While the shortened term "all the earth" (kol-haÉares) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context (see Exodus 10:5, 15; Numbers 22:5, 11; 1 Kings 4:34; 10:24; 2 Chronicles 36:23; Genesis 41:57), the immediate context of the Flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom God had made and created (Genesis 6:6,7) to have dominion over "all the earth" (Genesis 1:26), and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the Tower of Babel "upon the face of all the earth" (Genesis 11:4, 8, 9). In each of the four occurrences of the phrase "upon the face of all the earth" in Genesis outside the Flood story (Genesis 1:29; 11:4, 8, 9), it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe, and there is nothing in the Flood narrative to indicate any less universality. (It should be also noted that the one place in Genesis where in context a similar phrase "upon all the face of the earth" is not universal [the famine mentioned in Genesis 41:56], the Hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in Genesis [Ìal-kol penê haÉares]).Third, the phrase "face of the ground" penê haÉadamah (five times in the Flood narrative, 7:4, 22, 23; 8:8, 13), occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted, "the earth" (7:23) and "face of all the earth" (8:9); and this phrase "face of the ground" likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation (Genesis 2:6).Fourth, the term kol-basar "all flesh" occurs 12 times in Genesis 6-9 (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, 19; 7:16, 21; 8:17; 9:11, 15, 16, 17). The word kol "all" (which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands), before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix, as here in Genesis 6-9, indicates totality. God's announcement to destroy "all flesh" (Genesis 6:13, 17) and the narrator's comment that "all flesh" died (Genesis 7:21-22), except the inhabitants of the ark, indicates universal destruction. The one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar "all the flesh" (in Genesis 7:15) likewise indicates totality as well as unity.Fifth, the expression "every living thing" (kol-hahay) of all flesh (Genesis 6:19), is another expression of totality; in 7:4, 23, the similar term kol-hayeqûm means literally, "all existence." This term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation — "all existence that I have made" (7:4) — and by the exclusive statement "Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive" (7:23). As Hasel puts it:There is hardly any stronger way in Hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed. The writer of the Genesis Flood story employed terminology, formulae, and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal, world-wide flood (Hasel 1975, p 86).Sixth, the phrase "under the whole heaven" (tahat kol-haššamayim, Genesis 7:19), is used six times in the OT outside of the Flood narrative, and always with a universal meaning (see Deuteronomy 2:25; 4:19; Job 28:24; 37:3; 41:11; Daniel 9:12). For example, the phrase is used to describe God's omniscience: "For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens" (Job 28:24). Again, it depicts God's sovereignty: "Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine" (Job 41:11 KJV). (Note that the usage in Deuteronomy 2:25, describing "the nations under the whole heaven," is further qualified and limited by the phrase "who shall hear the report of you," and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense.)The universal phrase "under the whole heaven" or "under all the heavens" also universalizes the phrase "under heaven" (Genesis 6:17) in this same Flood context. The word "heaven" alone can have a local meaning [e.g., 1 Kings 18:45], but here the context is clearly universal. Ecclesiastes, which contains numerous allusions to creation, likewise utilizes the term "under heaven" with a universal intention (Ecclesiastes 1:13; 2:3; 3:1; cf. the parallel universal expression "under the sun" in Ecclesiastes 1:3, 9; 2:11, 17; etc.).In the Flood account this phrase "under the whole heaven" is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the Flood: "and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered" (7:19, 20). Critical scholar John Skinner notes that 7:19, 20 "not only asserts its [the flood's] universality, but so to speak proves it, by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains" (Skinner 1930/1956, p 165).The biblical language here simply cannot be explained in terms of a local sky, and certainly cannot refer to the local mountains being covered by snow, as some proponents of a local flood suggest. H.C. Leupold points out that the writer of vs. 19 is not content with a single use of kol ("all") in "all the high mountains," but "since 'all' is known to be used in a relative sense, the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens.' A double 'all' (kol) cannot allow for so relative a sense. It almost constitutes a Hebrew superlative. So we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the Flood" (Leupold 1942, p 301-302).Seventh, Hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase "all the fountains [maÌyenoth] of the Great Deep [tehôm rabbah]" (Genesis 7:11; 8:2), and showed how it is linked with the universal "Deep" (tehôm) or world-ocean in Genesis 1:2 (cf. Psalm 104:6: "Thou didst cover it [the earth] with deep [tehôm] as with a garment; the waters were standing above the mountains"). The "breaking up" and "bursting forth" (i.e., geological faulting) of not just one subterranean water spring in Mesopotamia, but of all the "fountains" of the Great Deep, coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens, far transcends a local scene. Hasel perceptively concludes that "the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about" (Hasel 1974, p 71).Eighth, in another article, Hasel (1978) shows how the Hebrew Bible reserved a special term mabbûl which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal Genesis Flood (12 occurrences in Genesis, once in Psalm 29: 10). This word may be derived from the Hebrew root ybl "to flow, to stream." The term mabbûl, which in the Flood narrative is usually associated with mayim "waters," seems to have become "a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood (deluge) being caused by waters. ... mabbûl is in the Old Testament a term consistently employed for the flood (deluge) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters" (Hasel 1978, p 92-93). This technical term clearly sets the Genesis Deluge apart from all local floods, and is utilized in the Psalm 29:10 to illustrate Yahweh's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the Noahic Flood: "The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood, and the Lord sits as King forever."Summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the Flood in Genesis 6-9, Hasel writes: The Genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style. It expects to be taken literally. There is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae ... which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense: the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe. To read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects (Hasel 1975, p 87).III. Other Biblical Evidence for a Universal FloodMany additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the Flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion. We will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text.First, the trajectory of major themes in Genesis 1-11 — Creation, Fall, plan of redemption, spread of sin — is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment. We have already noted in reference to specific Flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation. The creation of "the heavens and the earth" certainly is not local in scope according to Genesis 1-2.Likewise, the Fall of humanity in Adam and Eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race (haÉdam), not just the inhabitants of Mesopotamia (see Genesis 6:5, 11; Romans 3:19; 5:12). Again, the Protoevangelium (first Gospel promise) outlined in Genesis 3:15, involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants (or "seed") of the serpent and the spiritual descendants ("seed") of the woman, culminating in the victory of the representative Messianic Seed over the serpent (see Robertson 1980). This plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope.In a similar way, the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the Flood includes more than those living in the Fertile Crescent. From God's perspective, not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator, we have the results of the divine investigative judgment: "And God saw that the wickedness of man (haÉdam, humankind) was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5). Such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment.Second, the divine purpose given for the bringing of the Flood makes explicit its universal scope: "And the Lord said, 'I will destroy man [(haÉdam), humanity] whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them" (Genesis 6:7). Nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race (except for Noah, 6:8) seems envisaged. Given the length of time from creation (over 1650 years minimum), the longevity of the antediluvians (nearly a thousand years), and God's command at creation to "fill the earth" (Genesis 1:28), it is highly unlikely that the pre-Flood population would have stayed only in Mesopotamia. Thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local Flood.Third, the genealogical lines from both Adam (Genesis 4:17-26; 5:1-31) and Noah (Genesis 10:1-32; 11:1-9) are exclusive in nature, indicating that as Adam was father of all pre-Flood humanity, so Noah was father of all post-Flood humanity. From the descendants of Noah "the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood" (Genesis 10: 32), and the Tower of Babel experience spreads humanity across the globe (Genesis 11:1-19).Striking extra-biblical evidence that all human races, and not just the nations of the Fertile Crescent, are included in the descendants of Noah, and retain memory of the universal Flood, is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world. Over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth (see Frazer 1918, 1:105-361; Nelson 1931). A world-wide flood is by far the most frequently-given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity (Thompson 1955, 1:182-194).A remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account: all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin, and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea-faring vessel. The stories nearest to the area of the Dispersion at Babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account (see Heidel 1946, Jacobsen 1981, and Lambert and Millard 1969). This vast body of ancient witnesses to a world-wide Deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical Flood.Fourth, the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both Adam and Noah (Genesis 1:28; 9:1). This is another linkage between universal creation and the flood, between the original beginning and the "new beginning." As the human race at creation flows from Adam and Eve, so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through Noah.Fifth, the covenant (Genesis 9:9-10) with its rainbow sign (Genesis 9:12-17) is clearly linked to the extent of the Flood, and includes the whole earth (Genesis 9:13-17). If there was only a local flood, then the covenant would be only a limited covenant, and the rainbow sign of "the all-embracing universality of the Divine mercy" (Delitzsch 1888/1976, 1:289-290) would be stripped of its meaning.Sixth, the viability of God's promise (Genesis 9:15; cf. Isaiah 54:9) and the integrity of God in keeping His promise is wrapped up in the world-wide extent of the Flood. This point cannot be underscored too heavily: if Genesis 6-9 describes only a local flood, then God has broken His promise every time another local flood has happened! The only way God's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing (Genesis 8:21) can be seen to have been kept is if the Flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed.Seventh, the universality of the Flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in Genesis 6:14-15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark (Genesis 6:16-21; 7:2-3). A massive ark filled with representatives of all non-aquatic animal/plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood, for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world. Yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds (Genesis 6:19-20).As a matter of fact, if only a local flood were in view, the building of any ark at all, even for Noah and his family, would have been superfluous — God could simply have warned Noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment, just as he did with Lot in Sodom. But the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape; in the midst of the Flood "only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained" (Genesis 7:23).Eighth, the covering of "all the high mountains" by at least 15 cubits (Genesis 7:19-20) could not involve simply a local flood, since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe. Even one high mountain covered in a local Mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet's surface.In this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as Mt. Everest at the time of the Flood, and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles, as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary (see Ramm 1954, p 242). The antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present. Passages in the book of Job and Psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift (see Job 9:5; 28:9; and Psalm 104:7-8).Also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise, namely, that a world-wide Flood would imply "that the earth's surface was completely renovated during the flood year" and thus "prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography." This implication, they claim, is in conflict with biblical evidence which "strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography" (Young 1977, p 210). Reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the Garden of Eden: the lands of Havilah and Cush, and the four rivers, two of which (the Tigris and the Euphrates) were familiar to the readers of Genesis in Moses' time.What is not recognized in these arguments, however, is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography, there are more differences than similarities. Two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in Moses' time: the Pishon and Gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow, in the postdiluvian areas of Havilah and Cush respectively. The other two rivers — the Tigris and Euphrates — are described as coming from a common source in the Garden of Eden, certainly far different from their present courses. Thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of Genesis are in harmony with a world-wide Flood. Also, it is likely that survivors of the Flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the Flood, even though the earth's surface looked entirely different.Ninth, the duration of the Flood makes sense only with a universal flood. The Deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days (Genesis 7:17), and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the Flood began; the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months, and the Flood waters were not dried up enough for Noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed (see Genesis 7:11; 8:14). Such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood.Tenth, the receding activity of the water (Genesis 8:3a, 54a) is described by Hebrew phrases which, in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the "to and fro" motion of the raven (Genesis 8:7), should be translated as "going and retreating," (see Austin 1990, p 218; Hasel 1978, p 93) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days (see Genesis 8:3-5). The waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased, supports a universal interpretation such as "the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood" (Austin 1990, p 218), but is incongruous with a local flood theory.Eleventh, the NT passages concerning the Flood all employ universal language: "swept them all away" (Matthew 24:39); "destroyed them all," (Luke 17:27); "he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven other persons, ... when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly" (2 Peter 2:5); "a few, that is eight persons, were saved through water" (1 Peter 3:20); Noah "condemned the world" (Hebrews 11:7). A local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world. As Archer states, "we have the unequivocal corroboration of the New Testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal" (Archer 1985, p 208).Twelfth, the NT Flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity, but also the universality, of the Flood to theologically argue for an imminent world-wide judgment by fire (2 Peter 3:6-7). Peter argues that just as there was a world-wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish, so in the antitype there must-needs-be a universal end-time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327).Thirteenth, key terms and motifs that we have already noted in Genesis 6-9 converge to make a major theological statement: the Noahic Flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation. Numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the Flood narrative. Nahum Sarna writes that "The Flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation." In other words, creation is being undone, and the world returned to chaos (Sarna 1989, p 48).Tikva Frymer-Kensky describes the Flood as "the original, cosmic undoing of creation" (Frymer-Kensky 1983, p 410; cf. Frymer-Kensky 1985, p 312). Claus Westermann speaks of the "invasion of chaos into the created order; the flood assumed cosmic proportions" (Westermann 1974/1984, p 434). Umberto Cassuto points out that at the high point of the Flood, "We see water everywhere, as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of Creation, when the waters of the Deep submerged everything" (Cassuto 1964, p 97). David Clines uses the apt term bouleversement or "reversal" of creation to depict the theological significance of the Flood (Clines 1972, p 136). For Joseph Blenkinsopp, ... the deluge is an act of uncreation, undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval, watery chaos from which the created order first arose (Blenkinsopp 1992, p 83; cf. Blenkinsopp 1971, p 46-47).Gerhard von Rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation: ... we must understand the Flood, therefore, as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos. When the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below, and the primeval sea beneath the earth, which is restrained by God, now freed from its bonds, gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth, then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology. The two halves of the chaotic primeval sea, separated — the one up, the other below — by God's creative government (ch. 1:7-9), are again united; creation begins to sink into chaos. Here the catastrophe, therefore, concerns not only men and beasts ... but the earth (chs. 6.13; 9.1) — indeed, the entire cosmos (von Rad 1972, p 128).Only a cosmic/universal Flood can theologically encompass the cosmic/universal reversal or undoing of creation described in Genesis 6-9.Fourteenth and last, the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic New Beginning. As Clines states it: ... the 'uncreation' which God has worked with the Flood is not final; creation has not been permanently undone. Old unities of the natural world are restored (8:22), and the old ordinances of creation are renewed (9:1-7) (Clines 1972-73, p 138).Jacques Doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of "re-creation" in the aftermath of the Flood (Genesis 8-9) and the seven days of creation in Genesis 1-2 (Doukhan 1987, p 133-134; cf. Gage 1984, p 10-20): The wind over the earth and waters. Gen. 8:1; cf. Gen. 1:2. Division of waters. Gen. 8:1-5; cf. Gen. 1:6-8. Appearance of plants. Gen. 8:6-12; cf. Gen. 1:9-13. Appearance of light. Gen. 8:13-14; cf. Gen. 1:14-19. Deliverance of animals. Gen. 8:15-17; cf. Gen. 1:20-23. Animals together with men, blessing, food for men, image of God. Gen. 8:18-9:7; cf. Gen. 1:24-31. Sign of covenant. Gen. 9:8-17; cf. Gen. 2:1-3. Thus in the over-arching literary structure of the "re-creation" in the Flood narrative, the universal dimension of the Flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of Genesis 1-2.IV. ConclusionIn conclusion, the question of the extent of the Genesis Flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for Christian faith. For those who see the days of creation in Genesis 1 as six, literal 24-hour days (see Hasel 1994), a universal Flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column. A literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world-wide flood.But a universal Flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and Scripture. It is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of Genesis 1-11 and the rest of Scripture. (For a more detailed discussion of the theology of the Genesis Flood in its canonical context, see Davidson in press.) The many links with the universal creation in Genesis 1-2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the Flood, but serve to theologically connect Protology (Creation) and Eschatology (Judgment/Salvation) in the opening chapters of Scripture. The Flood is an eschatological step-by-step "uncreation" of the world and humanity followed by a step-by-step "re-creation" of the new world. "Thus," writes von Rad, "the story of the Flood — and this is theologically the most important fact — shows an eschatological world judgment.... The world judgment of the Flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation" (von Rad 1972, p 129-130).The theology of the universal Flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi-faceted universal theme running through Genesis 1-11 and constituting an over-arching pattern for the entire subsequent world-wide creation revealing the character of the Creator and His original purpose for creation; humankind's turning from the Creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal "uncreation" through eschatological judgment; and re-creation, in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth.

1	Was the Bible written by man under inspiration?  If yes, why is it not to be taken literally?  If no, why take cognisance of any of it?  If Jesus existed, was crucified and died for us, why do you take that bit literally when you've already stated the contrary?  What happens to unbaptised infants?  Once baptised, can I murder and cheat and steal? You said I don't have to do anything (for God) because I am under grace (wanted or not). Should I take this literally or not?  What about the Scriptures - He that endures to the end is the one that will be saved, and, faith without works is dead etc. That contradicts your doing nothing.  If that's not a clear-cut case of Christianity on the individual's terms (not God's), then I don't know what is.  Fascinating.
1	Yes they are mutually exclusive SD, or else God is a liar. Can't you see that? Tell me how God could have created the Heavens, the Earth and all life as described in Genesis less than 10,000 years ago, AND simultaneously allowed intelligent life to have evolved through random mutation by way of natural selection over a period of billions of years? Explain that massive inconsistency to me in a rational and consistent manner if you can.  The bottom line is that when all is said and done, either ID or evolution will be proven to be 100% wrong. And it won't matter to God at all if the other side is only partially right. But the side that's wrong has had to have erased Him from the equation in order to get to that fallacious conclusion, and that side is evolution which exists for the purpose of offering a secular humanist answer for how man came to be here.
1	You've got it backwards, disorder in the universe is increasing, (see entropy).An increase in complexity does not mean there is an increase in organized matter, the opposite is true.A random pile of building material is more complex then a house which is created from that same pile of building materials, because that material is now organized.To make matters worse, organized matter increases entropy because it takes energy to organize it.

You also seem to think that you can date rocks with carbon 14. You can't. Time after time you reveal your ignorance by your inability to respond appropriately. KNM-WT 15000 was dated from stratigraphic studies of the area and dating of specific, appropriate rock samples from above and below the fossils.
1	Yes, I've met enough  British  creationists to know. The difference is one of exposure (they don't have anything like the public profile of the US movements) and the pervasive attitude to religion in the UK- people are generally much less up front about their religious beliefs over here.  On the poll results, there is some ambiguity IMO. When it states 22% of people believed in creationism what exactly was the question posed? does that mean young earth creationism or old earth creationism or both? Also interesting is the apparent indication of how intelligent design has been rapidly adopted as a method of explaining ones position.  The program, Horizon: A War on Science is on tonight at 9:00pm on BBC2, should be an interesting watch.

Rational judgement would put one down the path of pro-life, however, I must say there are plenty of people above me that I would call an intellectual before I call myself that. Justice Scalia comes to mind. And likewise, I wouldn't accuse you of being in the "intellectual" coloumn either.
1	No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.
0	But you have dodged the question? My specific question that I would like you to answer is why don't you believe in the Buddhist god, Buddha?And guess what, meaning and values have nothing to do with a god or not, my values are based on what I think is right. I don't see that there.
0	Working on it. Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded (it was really big, at leat 20 typed pages). I plan on buying from them when they get it back, and maybe putting up a whole page in honor of it. Partly because I think it is very telling, partly because I remember what it was like to be in college and get a little recognition for your work.
0	So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others.
1	Well, I forgot to add one thing: a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior.
0	Hey Sarge,add Democratic on their, and it could be called the DPRK; its kinda going that way anyhow.People start calling it that now,they will fall in line faster.:)
0	But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution, which is based on lies and deceptions, they prove right there that they haven't enough knowledge of the truth, nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie. So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend? I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so. So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it.
1	Well, criticism of your opinions isn't hard to find here. What is interesting is that you rarely have anything substantial against those criticisms. After all, you said that bees cannot fly, tv show props are good evidence of creationism, and that oil is not a hydrocarbon.  Your opinion does not count for much given its consistent history of massive and epic levels of incorrectness.  Interesting how you think that because we arouse through natural processes we don't have any more value than anything else that arouse through natural processes. Sterile sand is natural. So is uranium. Tell me, which is more valuable?
1	The documents contained in the bible are historical artifacts. They reflect the beliefs and values of the people who wrote them. When we read Paul we might not believe everything he says but overall we can believe that he preached a gospel that Jesus was born, crucified, died, and risen. We can discern his message from the 7 or so letters we know of his. We can generally believe that he met people named Peter, James, and John who were "reputed to be pillars" and "seemed to be important." We know that he claimed his knowledge of Jesus came through revelation and scripture and claimed that other apostles had similar sources of knowledge. I think we can trust Paul's claims on these things. Do we need to believe he really had revelations? I don't know. Maybe in his own way he did. I think we need to lean toward Paul believing in the truth of his claims.I would think the court would think very dimly of the hearsay claim that 500 anonymous people had a revelation of the Risen Christ.
1	No, but it does develop very late on, and most abortions are carried out early. Over 99% is pretty high, considering abortions carried out very late tend to be because of problems medically with the mother or the foetus where an abortion is the best option. 
0	You aren't serious are you??? Is this a joke? You're one of the most active attackers of Christianity in these threads. Aren't you the one that likes to use the term "Christonazi?"
0	Then get your sick, satanic mitts off everyone else.
0	And here is another old standby-Theistic evolutionists do not exist. They are either confused Christians who are losing their faith, or they are lying atheists. So, E. Mutz, Jo Bennett, which are you? Lost christians or lying atheists?
1	What does being a priest have to do with anything? It wouldn't matter if he were a Satan worshipper.
1	First off, not all pro-choice advocates support this position. Second, How does a sonogram help to make an informed choice? What does a sonogram actually inform a pregnant woman about...that she is pregnant? I would think that if she was going to get a sonogram, that she would know that she is already pregnant. Seems like simple logic to me. By saying it would help them make a better choice, don't you really mean to say that it might influence them to not have an abortion, which is actually your choice for them? You seem to be counting on the puppy store effect. You can drive by the puppy store every day without giving a thought to buying a puppy. But if you actually stop and look at one, you might just feel sorry for the pathetic little puppy couped up in the little cage, and decide to buy it just to "rescue" it from it's plight. It goes something like this:"awww...look at the cute little puppy, we can't leave it here, we just have to take it home". 4 months later, that same cute little puppy is sitting in an SPCA shelter waiting to either be adopted or destroyed. All because it's do-gooder owner made the decision to buy it based on emotion rather than informed choice.
1	First of all, why would you take humans out of consideration? Doesn't the verse I posted above show where in addition to God blessing Adam and Eve in marriage, it speaks of God giving humanity dominion over every creature on Earth which humanities personal history is evidence of actually happening? So since we are made in Gods image:Gen 1:26 Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."And notice how here, as He decides to create us in His image, He repeats Himself by giving us the same authority over all living things as He did when He blessed Adam and Eve and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply 2 verses later at Genesis 1:28? So just because homosexuality is found in the animal kingdom, who also never sinned against God and fell from grace by the way, it's irrational to compare animals sexual habits to Mans as we are made in Gods image and live by different morals and values than animals do. And btw, welcome to the forum. emoticonXGood
1	Walking-fish:  This appears to be a rare birth defect known as anencephaly, where the neural tube closes off prematurely in the fetus. Such infants lack a cerebrum, although they may have a brainstem. This is why they have such frog-like features. They usually die within a few hours or days, being virtual vegetables. Here is a link to the wikipedia description of anencephaly:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anencephaly
1	Because what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread, it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term, and you can’t blame only me for it, since I didn't start the thread, and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread, the rest were coming from evolutionists. Please read its opening post (by an evolutionist) – you’re not going to find much about biology there. 
1	Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)

1	Just because something is genetically predisposed does not mean it has a positive benefit, but I never said that it did. Homosexuality is different, because it has no negative reprocussions that are not caused by something social or religious.
1	No it does not. God never attempted to provide proof anyway, aside from the testimony of a few witnesses. He leaves it to every person to decide for himself and believe in him or not. He requires that we believe in him without solid evidence based solely on the changed lives of those who do believe. Anyone who searches for indisputable evidence of God’s existence will not find it. There will be no physical evidence, no wonders, no miracles, no voice from the sky. You will only see God working in the lives of people or within your own life. That is the basis of faith. To believe what you cannot see. 
1	You say you cannot see it from the gay perspective, then you speak from that perspective as a gay man. This is confusing. As a heterosexual, if you are one, would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights?
1	Evidence isn't peer reviewed.(*-see correction below)  Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what's peer reviewed.  And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't  proven  anything.  The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.  Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered.  The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.  There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians.  Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.  But, do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang?  Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?  Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals.  Yes, of course the past can never be proven.  But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.  We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.  * - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)

1	What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).

1	Just because we do not know the laws of logic does not mean they do not exist. I could debate someone and violate the laws of logic and claim I don’t have any knowledge of them and therefore they don’t exist for me.Attacking the person again, not the argument, I guess atheists can make logical fallacies because it’s a concept that they can choose to not exist like the concept of “hofflenosh”
0	You degrade her by assuming nothing going on her life is important enough to consider outside of that pregnancy. To a militant lifer she becomes nothing more than a pregnancy - her circumstances, reality, voice no longer matter at all. You gag her, trivailize whatever may be going on in her life a well as the physical, emotional and financial realities of pregnancy, and demonize her if she can't embrace motherhood for any reason short of her immenent death.
0	Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.
1	Really, what is the materialistinc approach to which you refer (assuming you're also talking about 'pain')?  a) Is it strictly materialistic, or do they use non-material methods as well?  b) Can it be used to onbjectively measure pain?
0	You mean yours. Make up your mind as to whether or not there's a problem and what it is. State for the board.  You already know I support HR 676 which is under 30 pages.  Reading and mathematics. Something you could try.
1	Well, there you go. The fact he, in his reverse analogy, portrays mere disagreement in many cases as telling  posters there how disgusting and sinful they are and how their rights should be denied  only makes my point. No once do I recall seeing anyone here saying that he or anyone else was  disgusting,  and  sinful.  Apparently he's not too familiar with the concept of ad hominem either.

Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don’t believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she’s told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us.
1	It depends, now, doesn't it.  What are you looking to do with it. It is a great set of stories to derive moral principles out of, if you look at it in the proper light (THe key is stories). From a historical point of view, it gives insight into the culture and concepts of an early people.  Like anything, it is what you make of it.

0	Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.
1	Well... someone hasn't been following the campaigns for the so-called "protection of marriage" amendments, federal or state.
0	And yet, and yet... all these unprovable assumptions and unprovable conclusions and unverifiable predictions, all this faulty and misleading nonsense based on nothing more substantial than a desire to deny the existence of god... keeps paying off.
1	Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.

But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation.

0	Crackpot suggests that the environment changes to suit organisms! More at 11.Unsurprisingly, SS has abandoned another thread and -- unbelievably -- started another showing even more ignorance of basic biology. I didn't think it could be done. How silly of me.Well, I could just post the above, but SS would no doubt jump up and down having a hissy fit about how I "wasn't able" to counter his points. So here's a short list:* Selection does not require inability to breed, only differential breeding rates.* Ring species demonstrate precisely what SS asserts doesn't exist.* Selection is not survival of the fittest. Although much better descriptions exist, it could better be described as "statistically preferential perpetuation of the fittest."* Many primates fight within their own tribes to gain dominance. Infanticide is common. Do you consider this "for the benefit of the population"?* Even were there universal cooperation among populations, that wouldn't prevent differences in fitness.* SS provides no quote or citation for the alleged assertion that [a certain occurrance of] evolution could never happen the same way twice.I would also like to point out that once again we have a broken link that shows that not only is supersport simply copying and pasting his baloney, his common sense is so lacking that after being called on this numerous times, he doesn't even pay attention to the problem.Run, SS, run!

No. Do they have maternity wards? No. What do they do? They give out pregnancy tests and do abortions. That's where they get their money- a quarter of all their revenue is from pre 13-week abortions. This is not even countig their later more expensive abortons that are also so common! They get $40 million a year for abortions alone.

1	 I know a bit about this myself.  However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute. An Armed person truly cannot be bullied! The old saying is. God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal! Old, disabled, female and all, are on an equal footing with these vicious predators!
0	What I'm saying is, if the police are going to abandon you, and the law prohibits you from protecting yourself with deadly force, what defense do you have should somebody decide that they're going to victimize you?  Exactly what kind of qualifications are you going by in declaring a nation  developed  if the government is unable to protect you, and they've actually made it a crime to try and protect yourself during your time of need?

Do you know what the current state of affairs about the knowledge of abiogenesis is? Can you point to articles about it , showing it can't happen?? From peer reviewed journals of course.NO, you can't. I can show a lot of articles about abiogenesis , but that would be worthless for you. You would be unwilling to look at it. I could show you articles about on the development of gender, and of how sexual reproduction became to be formed, but you wouldn't look at it.

1	Since that would be me let's go over my position and you tell me which parts aren't reasonable and why:1. I've advocated registration of all handguns but not all guns. 2. I've advocated mandatory secure storage for unattended firearms, like when you're not home.3. I've advocated photographing and fingerprinting for all handgun purchases.
1	Population should decrease? Are you making another one of your anti-evolutionary statements? Populations are supposed to grow. However, the caucasian population is shrinking. You need to have 2.9 children in order to reproduce the population, but almost all of the European nations and the US arn't even producing that many. Our population is growing, but only because of hispanics.
1	I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal. What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be. However, I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away. Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago.
0	And the reasons have been discussed at length and most of us agree about the mother's life being endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest.........  Where we disagree with you is unecessary abortions...such as for birth control, a headache on just and inconveniencce........  You think any abortion is alright...We don't.....

0	Stop telling me to look at the big picture when you've had both of your eyes gouged out!Your entire statement here is beyond stupid. If the criminals felt that the only time to be armed was when their intended victims could fight back, then the criminals in DC would never be armed and the police wouldn't have needed to introduce gun shot sensors in the city. But since DC was the murder capital of the United States, that says an absence of hard targets isn't a guarantee that the abusers will play fair and not use weapons.

1	Actually all type fossils are given scientific names, and while this may be impressive-sounding to scientific illiterates, it is actually standard procedure. But more about reconstructions later.
1	maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.
1	And it is.
1	You seem to feel that scientists care about "creation" more than they do. Neither Kettlewell nor Majerus mentions creation or even takes it into account. But you have believed creationists who probably don't know as much as you. Kettlewell's work was not a fraud. He did the best he could with what he had and presented his work in peer reviewed literature. His work has nothing to do with creation. But it seems that creationists want to believe that all science is permanent and never changing. Thus, when re-evaluation of Kettlewell's work is done and flaws are pointed out, creationists loudly proclaim fraud and a victory for creation. Funny that it wasn't "creation scientists" who pointed out the flaws and it wasn't "creation scientists" who publicized them. It was done by two evolutionary biologists who didn't even mention creation.
0	Please demonstrate to us how running your gun free school would be different from how a prison is operated. You stated you wanted a fence with locked gates around the school. You wanted everybody searched before they entered school. You wanted all items searched before they entered school. This is how they operate prisons. Drugs and guns still make it into prisons. Let us not forget the airplane with the drugs and guns on it after all of the passengers were searched for weapons.
0	An abortion is an abortion. Your emotional use of the word  euthanasia  is pointless and irrelevant. Either you object to abortion or you don't. Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash.  I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion).  Don't like it? ... TOUGH!  And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself.
0	So if I did find a vender, then what would you say? Why do we prevent the importation of weapons grade plutonium? Shouldn't that be protected under the second amendment? Why doesn't the government allow people to produce nucleur weapons? If the government suddenly stopped all production of guns except those that were sold to the Department of defense, would it suddenly make this arguement moot?
1	And once more it could not be nothing. Nothing would have no density and no temperature especially densities and temperatures unprecedented in our current universe.
1	Of course it shouldn't be used as birth control, but because of religious ignorance against birth control, in any form, so many don't have easy access, or even proper education about such things.Places which have proper access and education have far fewer unwanted pregancies as well. The USA has twice as many unwanted pregancies as Canada and I think 36 times as many as Japan.BTW, an interesting fact is that the USA (280 million} is now the 3rd most populous nation in the world right after China (1.3 billion), and India (1 billion). The former USSR had been 3rd, I think, with a little over 300 million.
1	Correct. The National Guard is nothing more than an 'extension' of the Federal Army (and Air Force). We wear the same uniform as our active duty counterparts as well.You may recall that back in the 60's Gov. George Wallace was powerless to stop the 'Federalization' of National Guard troops which were used against him, by forcing the desegregation of Alabama schools. Regardless of where you stand on the politics of that situation, the Federal government clearly overstepped their authority here and thus established their control over 'National Guard' units henceforth.The National Guard being referred to as the 'militia' is laughable and wholly inaccurate. It's a cop out used by anti-gunners to excuse their attempts to disarm the 'law abiding'.
1	And yet there are plenty of websites written by scientists with the details:
1	Huh? With a 26" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles).
1	And we've already presented, countless times in the past, that all evidence points to less than 1% of guns recovered from crimes being traced back to gun shows. Ergo there is no emergency that needs to be addressed by forcing private citizens to carry out documented transfers in a business setting.
1	And how does that perspective even deal with the problem of limited ATP production in a low oxygen atmosphere? I suspect you don't understand the question. You're completely avoiding the issue of oxygen in the first place.  You don't even understand the very basics of biology!
1	Sometimes a pregancy means death. Most of the time it doesn't. Are we allowed to make this distinction since you brought it up or must we treat every pregnancy as life threatening?
1	Yes. For example, the hawthorn maggot fly was observed to change into the apple maggot fly in only a few years. I also gave the example of the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull that exists as a single, continuous population the circles the globe in which the extremes have become seperate species.Of course, what you are asking is if it has ever been observed that a frog turned into a lion. But that isn't evolution. In fact, a saltation (that is the word for that silly idea) would disprove the current theory of evolution. Organisms change only a little from generation to generation. Generally, evolution is a slow process since it happens in populations, not individuals. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of the entire population of over generations.
1	Actually, it was a new color. The black morph was first observed in 1848. That color arose by mutation. Similar mutations have been observed in the same gene in other species of moth. Nor is it proof of anything. And natural selection is but one of several mechanisms of evolution.
0	I am very sorry to hear that. And maybe I came off a little bias in my pastposts and now that I have really thought about my opinions and the way they have come off to people I know that it is not my place or any one elses to judge another. I guess some of need to clean our own backyard befor we look at our neighbors. Best of luck to you and your family.
1	it has been known for a long time -- it's just been surpressed because it contradicts genetic determinism and neo-darwinsm in general.
1	But psychologically speaking, a first trimester fetus is not a being since it lacks sentience. DNA is all it takes to confirm that something is human; like your fingernail pairings.
0	I don't give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either(obvious here I am not saying I don't care what happens to either, but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance). Neither one should have a right to kill the other...and for that matter, no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn. So my views are still treating them as equals.  and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can't prove.
1	When was the last time there was ever a mass murder at a gun range full or armed patrons? Or an International Practical Shooting Confederation match? Or any of our shooting sports that people come from all over the world to take part in?  If the  gun culture of America  is truly to blame for all these campus massacres, how come none of the shooters ever seem to be members of the NRA, or took part in a hunter's safety course, or anything else along those lines?
1	False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.
1	If little Jimmy was dead, this analogy might have some merits. Otherwise, compassion for little Jimmy is naturally based on the agony he will feel when he wakes up... One could also feel compassion towards poor little Jimmys family and friends (in the case Jimmy is dead). Ecpessially if little Jimmys body has been mutilated by some weird ugly guy.
1	Yes, but if seen from space (something the ancients couldn't do) it LOOKS like it hangs on nothing. Don't worry, I don't mind spelling it out for you.
1	First off, I think NATO had a pretty good point. What makes you think that every person shot was a pure victim?Second, is that why crime rates have gone down in DC after Heller vs DC and why they went down after Florida Shall Issue laws were reinstated?I'm guessing thats also why New York City and Chicago have such low crime rates, right? emoticonXRolleyes
1	We have a similar piece of legislation in the UK. Statute requires that every male over the age of 14 turn out at their local churchyard, on a Saturday, for two hours of longbow practice for the purposes of maintaining a functioning militia.  It's generally regarded as an anarchronism hereabouts. We did have a civil war in the meantime but somehow everyone who wanted to get involved managed to find themselves a weapon and it all turned out okay.  On the other hand, the statute that makes it legal to shoot a welshman with a bow and arrow if he's caught in sight of the city walls of Chester after midnight, should be protected with our collective dying breaths. Take away that right and who knows where it will end?
1	That I have failed to prove it at all is only according to the atheist worldview. A neutral, agnostic worldview may think they are somewhat comparable. The Judeo Christian worldview that is taught to many students by their parents would think that evolution (happenstance origins) isn't in any way close to ID. So we have two one sided worldviews, and one neutral one. Since a free exploration of ideas would give students the most complete picture, would interfere less with altering their worldviews that were most likely formed in the home, and would be most likely to teach them HOW to think, why are we dangerously close (thanks John Jones) to allowing one - one sided worldview to completely suppress another worldview in the science classroom? The answer of course, is politics. Science has become more and more politicized as the domestic federal government grows larger and larger. The government that once had limited powers has become more and more discoverers of emergencies and crisies, that entitle us all, particularly organizations, to a share of federal pie. Science has gladly hopped on board - they have the measuring devices, the microscopes and telescopes. In 1989, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $7.9 billion. In 2005 it's $28.8 billion. This is one of many government agencies that science "serves", and others have fat budgets as well. Leaf through Science magazine and you'll see that the maintanance of government spending on science is one of it's biggest preoccupations. To maintain it, science peddles hope and fear. Of course, some say that religion peddles the same thing. Science would rather not compete with it, and it certainly doesn't help when the new concept of ID, armed with the latest scientific discoveries, comes along questioning established scientific "theories" that keep them at the highest rung of the hope and fear ladder.It used to be that religion and science didn't compete, and they shouldn't today. But they do, and there's only one difference from yesterday and today - government money.
0	If you know where the commies have a debate forum, please post it here. I would like to go and join. Just to make it clear I'm joining the forum, not the commies.
0	I've heard that the people who think that gay marriage is right should look in the bible because it says Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve! If you don't believe in God well then I suppose you should understand the concepts of having a baby don't include 2 people of the same sex.They just weren't made that way!
0	That argument cuts both ways.  The question comes up regarding what's YOUR beef on the issue?  Why are you so insistent on maintaining two separate groups?  Is it because you want to reserve marriage as  prestigous  whereby gays are kept out?
0	I think what they're starting to finally get is that it's political suicide to over-restrict people's right to adequately defend themselves. But I suspect that, if not for the American people, many of them would still eagerly take your 2nd amendment constitutional rights away in a New York (or San Francisco) minute.
0	Yea verily!
1	Face it. Gun control is nonsensical. NOBODY has EVER managed to show any benifit from it. At best, it has no effect on crime and at worst it increases it.
1	But would you understand what I was talking about if I referred to AL 288-1, Trinil 2, Sangiran 17, KNM-ER 1813, OH 13, KNM-WT 15000, or Saccopastore 1? You know so little that you don't even realize that the names to which you object are not scientific names but names popularized by the press for people, like you, who know so little about it. Scientifically, both Java Man and Peking Man are Homo erectus. They are classified as such because there are no significant differences between them. In fact, there is little difference between Java Man (Trinil 2) and the skull of Nariokotome Boy (KNM-WT 15000), from Africa, or KNM-ER 3733 for that matter.But you are obsessed with the words. You are so bent out of shape because transitional species between ape-like ancestors and us, that walked upright and used tools are called "man". And they aren't assumed to be ancestral. Why don't you learn what you are talking about before you speak. You make yourself look foolish when you speak from ignorance.]quote]Regarding the Java Man, How is this skull cap evidence of anything concrete?[/quote]How is it that you think that evidence against your mythology based point of view supports your mythology?
1	Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it. 
1	In science, a scientific method actually exists. There is no scientific method in creationism. Religion cannot use the scientific method.
1	There are many people who may be involved and impacted by pregnancy - but only one person is actually physically pregnant.
1	This is a common creationist trick. Jonathan Wells has two PhD's, one in Molecular and Cell Biology, the other in Religious Studies. Jonathan Wells works for, or affiliated with (it's difficult to know for sure) The Discovery Institute. This is a pro  Intelligent Design  (ie Biblical Creationism by stealth) organisation based in Seattle in the USA. It spends around $1 million a year promoting  Intelligent Design  and attempting to rubbish evolution.  I'm not suggesting that Jonathan Wells is inherently wrong; I'm just pointing out that he is far from  objective and neutral  on this subject.
0	If someone gets busted for providing a firearm to a criminal there is already Serious jail time, regardless of what you say you want. If your law were to get enacted, what you say you wanted becomes totally irrelevant! Totally Irrelevant.
1	You gave it; therefor it's your defintion. Stop trying to accredit your opinion to athorities, and just argue the point.  Exactly. So the 'life' at conception must be rather different from 'life' in our world. No-one's arguing that humans don't start developing at conception; the point is whether or not it deserves to be considered a human life at that point.  No - standard scientific criteria for life.  Why did you raise them then?
0	If a scientist doesn't believe his test results are accurate, and expects me to place my life savings on his project would that not be pretty stupid.
1	So just do what you say you are. And by the way we already know why fruit eating primates and their descendants lack a working copy of GLUO. Its been lost in SOME of the species in which it was not useful, and of course in species where it was useful it could not be lost since any individual carrying a defective gene would DIE and fail to REPRODUCE. Natural selection you understand!
1	Because the theory of evolution is the result of science and therefore should be taught in science class.  ID is NOT science and therefore should NOT be taught in science class.  It's that simple.
0	When the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim, and this is viewed as being civilized, a society is doomed.
0	It needs to come with life to make life meaningful.  To have no control of your body - like rape, like an abusive relationship. I would rather be dead than go through it again.
0	I still haven't heard an answer to this yet?
1	Strawman. Evolution is a process, it's not "creating" anything.Fallacy: The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It's the conservation of energy. It has nothing to do with the reorganization of matter and/or energy into other forms. Whatsoever.No fallacy here on their side, but you're doing pretty good for your first point on your side.
1	So it has gone from an indeterminate (based on my quick searches) number of fewer isoforms in lower vertebrates to the 24 found in mammals. That's an increase in information.
1	Are you incapable of reading, as well as being mind-numbingly assinine? The thread is about creationism, not evolution. Attacking evolution does not defend the lies of creationists. Your failure to defend biblical creation shows that you cannot support your own position and instead have to resort to petty nit-picking of your opponent's position. This is both stupid and intellectually dishonest.
1	Well said. The truth of the matter is society's desire to hang blame on obvious contributing circumstances rather than attributing anything to developments leading up to and cumulating in that circumstance. Take away guns, knifes, etc. and something will be used, perhaps a deadly spray poison with components and mixing instructions available on the Internet. People will clamor to censor the Internet but distance themselves from social ills or personality defects as the basic, underlying cause.
0	Because of your question   What is your definition of pure , I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense.
0	Well, at least chimps have accomplished more than Creationists! :)  BTW, chimps aren't monkeys. I'm not so sure about Creationists, as they say they haven't evolved... emoticon_xbye
0	IMO, that's beside the point. The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people. Sure, people may still oppose gay marriage even if it's done legislatively as opposed to judicially, but at least then they'd have the chance and opportunity to do so. With only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important. So I think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat. Of course you feel they shouldn't have a say, so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat.
0	Once again as the noose tightens and they see their days are numbered. The religious elite feel their power and hold over the masses slipping. With Iowa and Vermont being major victories they'll stop at nothing to instill fear and confusion upon the American people to try and stem the tide that has been long overdue in rising.
0	......now you're just making stuff up.
0	You know America has fallen to a disgusting low when the parasites are furious that someone's rights are not being trampled on to an equal extent to everybody elses.It would be as though during the bombing campaign on Iraq, the left were out protesting that the US hadn't killed an equal number of Israelis, to be equitable.Why even bother getting into the idiocy of someone who thinks the constitution means "You can restrict free speech, as long as you restrict it to everybody equally, and don't do the 2nd amendment lobby any favours", maybe they've mistaken the constitution for the communist manifesto.
1	The AR-15 has over 100 parts in its assembly. Under the language of the Brady II bill, if it had passed, anyone wishing to assemble their own AR-15 would be required to acquire an arsenal license just for one gun.A notice to all supporters of gun control: We're no longer compromising, we're not the ones who have to. From now on it's up to you to justify, in an intelligent and sophisticated manner, exactly how your proposals qualify as "reasonable" and "common sense" and how they "don't infringe on the Second Amendment".
1	But I don't hear you saying things like  baseball is always harmful to the player  or  baseball is something no one should have to go through.   You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.  Besides, no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place.
0	As a Christian comfortable with their faith and reality.
1	well, in order to give you have to have first. how can you help the poor if we are all poor?
1	Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that "...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed." Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.

1	But you see, for the materialist, there is no distinction between  intelligence  and  the motion of physical particles in space , its not an either/or proposition - they may well say  He scored 155 on the IQ test because he is intelligent (by intelligent, meaning his brain has certain physical characteristics).
1	No, you are mistaken. Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time.
0	What evidence do you have of that? Tiger Woods is black and he said he felt entitled.   Personally, I think some of the worst racists are the flaming liberals who want to keep blacks content on their government-paid plantation.
0	I'd find it interesting to discover how many of those 58,000 were looking at very long and serious sentences, but were given a plea deal for reduced charges.
0	You mean I can get pregnant all by myself! COOL! Out with the men. They have been ticking me off for YEARS! ;)
1	Yes but the proposal was for a formal type debate judged by a third party. Here we are just discussing the debate so far.  Welcome to the forum.
1	I dont know how the negligence laws apply to First Aid in the states, but in Australia the situation is analogous. You can, as a trained first aider, walk down the street. You see a man with obvious severe injuries, who is screaming out for help. Until you accept the responsibility of helping that man, you have absolutely no duty of care to him.Similarly, until a mother accepts the responsibillity of having a child, she has absolutely no duty of care to it. She can even carry it to term and give it up for adoption.
0	Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child.
0	Actually, we do. These inconsistant laws are a product of pro-life people trying to create a stepping stone to a national ban.  Crimes against pregnant women should warrant a more serious offense, not an entirely new offense.
1	Actually the injunction is in place until the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decides. After that point, and if they decide the ruling was correct, then the injunction is done with (unless the 9th circuit issues its own similar injunction).It's not going to go straight to the Supreme Court.And, unless I'm mistaken, I believe that if the 9th circuit agrees such a law is unconstitutional, the areas they preside over that have similar laws will have those made null by that decision. IIRC that's how it works.
1	Nothing you've ever said regarding classical evolutionary theory has ever '######' me off, because in every case you have demonstrated contempt-fuelled ignorance of what it actually states. The number of incorrect statements you've made about what 'darwinists think' or 'darwinists believe' or, quite recently, what darwinists' materialist ideology 'forces them to assert' is large and increases daily. And so long as you continue to batter your pet strawman of the ToE in preference to tackling the real deal, I won't have to 'defend' anything; I'll just have to keep on correcting the same old mistakes.
1	Actually, the one chanting the equivalent of mantras is yourself. I have debated a plenty on single payer, posting resources/cites to back up my arguments. While I do not see you using either (a) reasoned argument, with the additional (b) cited sources to establish any factual assertions in your argument.So go jump in a lake, Steeeeeve.
1	HERE! HERE!  This is the core of the argument.... Liberty or prohibition.... Government Schools, Liberal Media, liberals all try to paint this picture of dependancy that unfortunatly have taken root. Freemen of this world know that there is only one option and that is liberty. Liberty minded individuals believe in the capabilities of men and women to be self-responsible, self reliant, self-dependant.  Who's the Boss of you?
1	you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what "morals" should be drawn out of the biomorphs.
0	Thinking, logical people do not automatically accept that government entities are qualified to make logical, well thought out rulings on things that truly matter. Who would ever have dreamed that officials could or ever would decide that destroying a life which exist, though it is incapable of expressing it's will to survive, as is natural for any living being, should be snuffed out at the whim of someone who indulged in the activity which produces life when they were not ready to deal with that life? Thus they give little thought to what those who spin un-thought out ideas as evidence.
0	I don't drink and I'm not overweight.  But I bet you have a bad habit with junk food and FOX news/couch potatoism. With a sixpack by your side.
1	No, it is not contradictive. There are many different theories on this topic, though.  The bible states that a) we have free will -- aka choices, and b) God has whatever plan for everyone...  In Genesis, Adam and Eve made the choice to eat from the tree, but He used the bad to do something (supposedly) good.
0	Bovine Excrement. Like Doc says, the Bill of Rights do not give us our rights, it only list them or enumerated, or numbered them.

Not for safety reasons, of course.And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.
1	Nothing  proves  evolution. However, there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that supports evolution.
0	Now as I have asked you perfectly legitimate questions, without any attacks on your personal self, and I have asked you to support your assertions, will you return and defend your beliefs and claims?  And obviously troll = anyone who disagrees with Marc9000. Just as atheist and liberal are defined in your dictionary.
1	With respect to the notion that the universe was created with the appearance of age, it would be quite a shock to find out that it was all created 5 minutes ago and everything you know is just a false memory... Ha Ha Ha Ha... But, of course, this is just a variation of the Omphalos theory put forth by Phillip Gosse in 1857.
0	Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no "irresponsible" pregnant woman goes unpunished.
1	Religious faith, by definition, is a "jump in the dark" and there is really little(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and ScientificMaterialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there isnothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. Butsomeone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see this.The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,aesthetic sensibility and such like.
1	If private firearms were to be made illegal across the board, I suggest to you the civil unrest you speak of would be epidemic in our nation. The US, as it has stood constitutionally for 215 years, though wobbly at times, would cease to have existed, as envisioned by the founders of our country, and having been sacrificed for by so many brave men and women. That is my opinion, and of course, may not be shared by many. 
1	OS is so consumed with vitriolic hatred of me he is incapable of realizing that I did not start this thread.  The fellow who started it has been banned for his extreme anti-woman views.  Perhaps OS should be banned for his extreme anti-Simone views.
1	You seem to think that any time someone is killed, the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator  devalued human life . If that was the case, gun manufacturers, car manufacturers, breweries, and cigarette manufacturers would  devalue human life  simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse. And the government would  devalue human life  by letting these companies operate under it. We do not go targeting innocent civilians. More often than not, the civilians are killed by Iraqi suicide bombers or  militia , and the few that are killed by the US are accidents.
0	I think they should, and I hope it passes. I have no problem with civil unions for gay couples, and Kansas should have allowed it too.
0	And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.
1	(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)  The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..  Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?
0	That depends on the circumstances. Only she can know.
1	Of course not, nor did I intend to imply that they were. I merely suggest that an increase, through education, in awareness of the diversity of religious belief has led some to a fuzzy-minded many-paths mentality, some to the conclusion that if 99.99% are wrong, there's a strong probability they're all wrong. There are lots of other positions.
1	Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. Why do you think otherwise? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.

1	This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.
0	You are not worth the debate. If you refuse to acknowledge anything I say, it is worthless to continue spitting it back to you.
0	I believe in that which is. Because to believe in anything else is ultimately pointless.
1	Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory
0	Could you be so kind as to point out the holes, please? Or are you going to dance around some more?
1	How something "looks basically" is basically irrelevant. How well a bird flies is very important. If a bird is born with feathers in the wrong position, it will probably not fly well and will have a much harder time evading predators.
1	Holy See needs to realize that what it says rarely makes its way into domestic policy.  Just because they are catholic doesn't mean they are bigots.  Spain may realize that true freedom cannot allow denial to a minority merely because of irrational reasons.  Not to mention Spain may realize this represents a higher tax base. Socialists may be misguided, but they aren't stupid.
1	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.
1	Just because 99% of astrophysicists believe that the earth orbits the sun, why should you? Just because 99% of medical doctors believe that germs cause disease, why should you? Just because 99% of geologists believe that plate subduction causes vulcanism, why should you? (I know I lost you on that one.) Just because 99% of physicists believe that the sun produces energy by nuclear fusion, why should you? And that's why I don't consult my plumber or my mechanic about plantar fasciitis. What do you know that makes you better informed than thousands upon thousands of scientists who have spent decades of study in their subject. But you, who hasn't read a single book or paper have done a  detailed study  (of course with an open mind) and concluded that you are right and they are wrong. Moreover, you think that the terminally ignorant should be allowed to vote on science.
1	I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.  Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.  You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth.
1	Yes, I've noticed that. I do think part of the problem is that he hasn't bothered to get educated in the subject. From the arguments I've seen from him over the time he's been here he seems to rely on YEC websites for information, and when he gets to something he doesn't know it seems like he cuts-and-pastes (often without fuly reading) from google (leading to the Civil War Dinosaur fiasco and the Nazca stones fiasco) that seems to support his views
1	Actually it just took GOD a long time to work out the bugs in his ideas thats why humans only appeared very recently. We are special because he took his time to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to build his masterpieces - namely us. We are after all the crown of creation meant to dominate all the inferior life forms and to take whatever we wish from the planet. Are we not?
1	Actually the question is  is DNA close enough to conventional codes to justify the term  code  being applied. The answer is no BTW. So asking who encoded it is like asking who built a sanddune: no one did, it formed through natural processes.
1	That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.
0	Because marc has a tendency to be highly dishonest, not to mention a tendency to equate nonreligion/secularism with atheism, I think you should consider clarifying from the get-go that non-theism is not atheism.
0	So what do you think about the fact that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of those who are aborted?  While this baby 21 week baby is living in one hospital room, down the hall a 22/23/24/25/26 ect week baby is being aborted because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
1	Actually, the black morph was always dominant. Perhaps you don't understand the meaning of the word dominant in biology. Perhaps that is why you talk nonsense. And why did you find it necessary to repeat what had already been said, and in fact what you had quoted?
1	They were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1.
1	But you see, for the materialist, there is no distinction between  intelligence  and  the motion of physical particles in space , its not an either/or proposition - they may well say  He scored 155 on the IQ test because he is intelligent (by intelligent, meaning his brain has certain physical characteristics).
0	Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained.
0	I think many things are getting confused here.First, I have no idea what “moral maturity” means. You talk as though that is some definable entity.Next, one may reasonably consider that children are cognitively different from adults. Despite what society or 5 judges have to say, that seems to me a valid reason for applying different sentences to different people.The question was raised with respect to the death penalty as well. We are not talking about criteria for guilt, but once convicted, we are talking about whether to execute a person or not. Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution, I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans. You have conceded that a difference in neurophysiologic fitness makes sense, but we should decide on a case by case basis. If you can figure out a reliable way to do that, go for it. We draw the line based upon age all the time for all sorts of things.The issue of abortion is different for many reasons. We are not deciding on whether to execute a person based upon a crime they committed. That makes it a different issue. Ideally, we would never have a pregnant young woman under the age of 18 make a decision like that without the support and guidance of her loving parents. The ideal situation sometimes does not exist. An underage female may legally make this decision precisely because there are many out there who do not have that guidance at all or informing parents would make things worse. It just so happens that females are fertile prior to 18, so we do not have the luxury of applying similar age requirements. If you could ban pregnancy prior to 18, now you’d be talking.
0	Why on earth would a woman come out now, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago, when it was illegal, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about?  Why on earth would any woman do that?  When did official medical records become non trustworthy? The conspiracy theories and blinders that both sides are wearing are astounding.  Waxy  P.S. I think the whole thing is repugnant, and any real politicizing of it by the Democrats would be disgusting IMHO. However, Bush did open the door with his strong anti-abortion stance, and sometimes, when you make your bed....
0	I think you need to read the book of Job.
1	Bingo. Relationships between appendices of closely related species still suggest that the appendix used to have a different function, namely digestion of roughage. Linky. (Plus what Otto said, again.)
1	First, take a visit to Mount Olympus. Secondly, Greek myths were written for entertainment. Lastly, if Zeus or any other mythological gods existed, why wouldn't they/it preserve their worshippers? When a human (actually, in the case of the Jews, humanS) make efforts to completely eliminate a race or religious group of people and there Book (the Bible) for over thousands upon thousands of years, and the people and Book are still preserved, that is evidence of a God, in my opinion.
0	Well it's a step in the right direction,and if you have 2 or 3 people per household, it would make him squirm good.lol.
1	Sarah Brady is a straw purchaser then. She knowingly broke the law by buying a gun for somebody else instead of letting them go through the NICS check system. Who knows what else she's done and who she's supplied guns to.
1	Yes,1) It's against Gods Law-an Abomination.2) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help, just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like. 3) Jesus loves you and you still have a chance to have questions answered that no one in the secular world can answer.
1	Well, let's think about that for a moment. The earth's atmosphere has a mass estimated at 5x10^18 kg, and that's if we count all of it, right up to the troposphere. Three quarters of a billion cubic miles of water would have a mass of around 3x10^21kg, almost a thousand times greater.So even if the heat from the emerging floodwaters was dissipated into the entire atmosphere, the water would only be cooled by about 0.1 degrees before atmospheric temperatures reached equilibrium and no more cooling could occur.
1	I've noticed. It's like walking into a rock fight between two of your best friends, and getting tore up. It saddens me to see such brilliant people ignore or supress one of the most beautiful parts of being a human.
1	So what? It's not like institutions in this country haven't been changed before, including the supposed intitution of marriage!  Guess what? It's called progress, get used to it.
0	Why do people keep posting anti-Bush/anti-US /nuclear weapons threads in the Gun Control forum?  Here's a hint: The  Gun Control  forum is for debating Gun Control.
1	Actually our school's Gay-Straight Aliance held a day of silence to show respect for gays who have had to live in silence. They asked the teachers to respect the people in their day of silence and not force them to talk. I think most teachers didn't force students to talk. Unfortunately, some just spoke in sign language for fun and said they were doing it as part of the day of silence.
1	Sigma I have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy. However, there are no doubt cases in the history of the world (not just within America) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child (ie: the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world). For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation. Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her?
0	I'd rather be "offed" than to live with a wild eyed screaming banshee like yourself setting policy and demanding impossible tasks.Are the police SOB'S too? I don't suppose you would object to the friendly neighborhood rapist getting shot by a gun owning neighbor now would you?
1	Or another example of how denying homosexuals access access to anything but the same legal institutions as heterosexuals will never result in equality. The domestic partner registry just isn't sufficient; why would anyone think that creating a similar marriage-substitute will be equal?
1	But of course! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state. (No system can ever be truly closed, truly isolated from the rest of the universe, for what should be obvious reasons. Certain systems are only classified as 'closed' for experiments' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results, thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide.) In your pool-shot example below, for instance, the initial state must take account of the wear & tear of the table, the strength of the cue, the slope of the floor, humidity, temperature and every other variable.So any such 'backtracking' (which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated. This is part of what chaos theory attempts to do, and why chaos theory must deal in probabilities until we have computers ordres of magnitude more powerful than we do today.
1	Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.
1	Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years. Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process. Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range, any time during those billions of years. 
1	No, the origin of the universe has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. Scientific disciplines have bounds. Biologists don't have to account for cosmology because it has nothing to do with the evolution of life on earth. However the universe came into being doesn't affect the theory of evolution. However life first arose has no bearing on the theory of evolution. The ultimate origin has nothing to do with the theory of evoution. I don't see where the definition you quoted does anything to make this point.......
1	You mean like showing what the Scientific Method is, and why this invalidates all creationists claims of doing science as outright lies? Do you want me to elaborate on that?Or did you mean the challenge of the creationist lie of "adaptation" not being Evolution? Do you want me to elaborate on that?Or the inane claim by bertvan that living systems all can react intelligently to stimuli (f.ex. I wonder how you think lichen react to stimuli with intelligence?) Is that what you wanted me to elaborate on?What part of the ####, nonsense and lies that bertvan spewed is it that you want me to elaborate on? Or did you want me to elaborate on some of the falsehoods and lies of yours that I have challenged? Are you actually up to dealing with challenges to your spewed falsehoods, or will you run from that?
1	And you're perfectly entitled to believe that, so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species, which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning, just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional. Just like all the other hominid fossils.  Are you starting to see my point yet? You're trying to claim that because Lucy isn't conclusive proof, she means nothing. That's fallacious reasoning: Lucy contributes to the accumulated evidence supporting common descent.  I don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.
1	Just like when you have an abortion, it cleans out your uterous so you can have another baby if you wish.
1	actually, thats not logic, but its closely related. of course, if you stick your hand in fire it will get burned. logic dictates that the sum of initial energy must equal sum of final energy. etc etcyou are very right that logic is predictable and constant. this is exactly why logic diametrically opposes god. a body of water cannot divide itself and leave a dry path down the center unless god something to defy logical law. because gravity exists, its logical for water or any fluid to be drawn by gravity to the lowest level possible. there is nothing miraculous about the common and predictable properties of water under the force of gravity, so god isnt needed to explain it because logic already hasif, however, that body of water behaves in a way that logic cannot explain, then we can almost positively assume that such is the intervention of god. the only acts that can be accredited to god, in the bible, are those where something illogical occured
0	So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions (a point I don't really care about) but unrelated to this topic...so if you want to talk about that, start another thread.So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers?
0	Truth be told, the mayor is grand standing for the Supreme Court in order to try ans sway their decision to allow them to continue their clearly unconstitutional gun ban! He doesn't want the National Guard any more than he wants a plague to come into the city of Chicago.  He is like a little child holding his breath in hope that he can get what he wants.
1	I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!
1	Oh yea, you need to retake math! Since when is 10^-93 = 0?  Oh, and you really should support your numbers. Odds are, they're bogus Creationist BS.
0	Yes, we should address social ills but until a society is achieved that is free of social ills then we'll still need gun-control. If gun-control preserves lives then it's increasing the freedom of good citizens.  Life is a very important right and freedom. Would you discourage people from having burglar alarms or from locking their doors? Burglar alarms and locks don't address the root causes of crime, but I'm still going to lock my door until a society that is free of social ills is achieved.
0	Thats a rather shaky argument. In some place felons do vote. Our own fast eddie has them getting signed up while in prison. If you take a right and question it, then it is no longer a right. It has become a defacto privilige. If it was up to me, criminals would have their own sanctuary away from the law abiding after they serve their time.
0	No foundation for Paul allegedly being  unaware  of these things. Nor does Paul anywhere claim these events didn't occur, although he had plenty of time and epistles to argue against them if he so chose.  Just another argument from silence.  p.s. Some of these are things are mentioned by Paul obliquely, like the Lord's Supper.  Next....
0	I COMPLETELY AGREE.  Waxy
0	Well then quit trolling, and start debunking the BS by providing links to cases that were solved by having a gun registry in place.
1	Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?
1	Let's see, what else in science isn't the absolute truth.....Well, it's still the heliocentric theory, so the earth orbitting the sun isn't the absolute truth. It's still the germ theory so germs and viruses causing disease isn't the absolute truth. It's still the atomic theory so atoms aren't the absolute truth and since chemistry stems from the atomic theory (chemicals and elements are, according to the theory, made up of atoms) chemistry isn't the absolute truth. gravity can't be the absolute truth because it's still the theory of gravity. And electricity sure can't be the absolute truth because it's part of the electromagnetic theory. It should also be noted that the theory of evolution is one of the most well supported theories in science, even though it isn't the absolute truth.
1	But if there are too many dogs wandering around they do not change to be cats, or rabbits, or humans do they. They do not change so as to have eight legs and spider eyes do they. But yes development of the phenotype is a result of the genetic heritage interacting with the environment, but its not an intelligent process. If you starve a young organism to near the point of death and then rescue it with food it will not develop as if it had food when it needed it. It will not express its full genetic potential. The environment OFTEN changes the outcome of development by imposing limits on reaching the biotic potential provided in the genome.
0	Bush has flip flopped just as much as Kerry. As for records, there is next to nothing showing that Bush actually showed up and did anything for the Guard.
0	really? So no murder law? No theft law?
1	So what is your point? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions. Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance. In religion, it is without question, a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth. Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth?
0	wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions
1	The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.  Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK.
1	So lets us and gays be honest when they/us talk about their 'right' to marriage.  We should not argue that gays should have the 'right' to marry we should argue that the definition of ' marriage' should be changed.  Whether you have or have not any objections to gay marriage only matters to you.  What matters is the opinions of the people who individually or collectively can change the law
0	Since you bring it up, I do think that you are a nut. But your site is even nuttier. Not one shred of evidence that I found - just assertion. Moreover, the author doesn't seem to know the difference between an hypothesis and a theory.

1	Actually, it can. The zygote doesn't always develop into an adult human being. In fact, about 60-70% of all zygotes never implants or gets rejected and end up being flushed down the toilet. And of those who do implant, some turn into blighted ovums or hydatidiform moles. So no, your claim is not as all-encompassing as you want to present it.[QUOTE]Conception/fertilization is the time in which this physical entity comes into existence. Prior to that time, this unique physical entity did not exist.[QUOTE]Which is also true after ANY cell division of any kind, and as such again is a rather meaningless point.
0	Just so!!  We are witnessing an arrogant display of the power that money has over the Congress in Big Health's attempt to scuttle health care reform.  My two Blue Dog Democratic Senators refuse to stick their necks out and take a stand.  If JFK were writing today, he would have a new book called Profiles in Cowardice, and my two Senators would make up the first two chapters.

1	Not all "orgnansims" are able to breed. Some are sterile (mules or ones with mutations), some die in the "lottery" (which is biased against certain traits), and some simply breed less (those who can't get as much food, for example).
0	Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.  Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?
1	Since when were proteins no longer structures? A basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase "structure defines function."
0	so people you dont know deserve to die? The point is that they are people. You are a person that is not well known. If you died, and someone that didn't know you saw your story on the news, they might not care, but you still matter don't you.
1	They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered.   During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother's death as a result of exhaustion, dehydration, infection, hemorrhage, or convulsions. Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children, her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8. This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth. 
0	Oh, is THAT where you are getting your anti-evolution information: The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book dealing with biology that was written not by a biologist, but by an engineer...right? Walter James ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And gee whiz, biologists don't agree with ReMine ... how strange! :-)  PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine himself when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.
0	But I think he likes you. My bad on the name though - my only excuse is that by thinking of him as Sspurt, it keeps me from calling him something worse in type.However, note that I didn't say he was philosophically identical to you - I just said that the two of you are left with denying and obfuscating, a charge that I stand by.
1	Species may die out, but they may also evolve into new forms- without reproduction there is no possibility of continuity over even short periods of earth time, with it there is.
1	So 5,000 to 10,000 women dying from illegal abortions isn't high? Dude, that is nearly five times the number of women who were dying from abortions in the 1940s! That is VERY high!
0	I believe I said I would change my view. I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic.
1	The first refutation is not a refutation at all - it is a retreat. No longer is God all-poweful, but he is all-powerful within the realm of logic. That reminds me of the guy in Monty Python's Life of Brian who says "Besides the sanitation, the education, the aqueduct, the public order, etc. what have the Romans ever done for us?"The second refutation sounds like something Rousseau said, along the lines of "I don't care about logic. I'll believe in God privately." If one can claim that the power of God is beyond logic, but still true, then one can also claim that the powerlessness of God is beyond logic, but true. Similarily, I can claim that "2+2=5" is true by saying "We humans are too simple-minded to understand it, therefore it must be true." That's fallacious.
0	So the bishops finally did it. They've been threatening to do that for years.Well, I guess it's time to yank their tax-exempt status from them. We could definitely use the money to pay for health care and rebuilding our nation's Bush-destroyed infrastructure.
1	No, it's plenty relevant. See what I mean, the pro-abortion crowd is attempting to downplay the signifigance of one of their heroines' philosophies. Especially when you consider that Sanger was in lock-step with Adolph Hitler's philosophy regarding the  master race! 
1	IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them! Various political figures and police officers are on the take, they're getting massive amounts of bribe money from the cartels, stopping them would prove detrimental.
1	Yes that actually did happen. And knowing our nanny state government where anything that could cause harm is banned we have it banned.  BTW do any of you know of some great airsoft fields over in USA?
0	Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?
1	I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the pro-life argument relies exclusively on religious doctrine. I'm a Conservative and religious, but I think that abortion can be discussed without bringing religion into it. My personal opinion is it's a mistake for Pro-lifers to bring religion into it because it fuels the hatred of the God-less Left LMAO
1	This is a good site to look at for such answers.   Tree of Life Web Project  By the way, 'and finally to a man' implies both a direction to evolution and an end point. Both of these are not part of the modern synthesis.
0	And a woman's life choices, health, and finances aren't up for hi-jacking. Every time a lifer talks about demanding the nine month rape, they talk about what the baby deserves or not deserves and how it shouldn't be punished. This SCREAMS that you don't value and respect women. The very idea that a woman is aborting as an act of revenge - it's absurd and insulting.
0	Hardly. Obviously I had a lot more sense than you. My house and land is paid for long ago, I refused all credit cards including VISA and BOA and shun debt. Hardly a hack until is comes to strong arm union tactics who use force to chill public debate or frighten working folks in their family home...unless they are public officials. emoticonXCensored I have worked mobs in an official capacity I don't think you can enlighten me much on mobocracy. I think your whole problem is you bought the scenario of blame the messenger to avoid placing the economic blame where it belongs. What is next? 60's style Alinsky tactics and bombing those you disagree with on American soil?
1	I think reason why the  hypothesis validated  card has been played here is because:  1. The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.  2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected  transitional  form.  3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.  Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.  Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated  I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled.
0	So if I come and insult and demonize you or somebody you love - you might still consider me a good person?
1	Yes, I mean the couple who was wrongly accused of being Russian spies in the 50's and then exicuted. This was stupid for at least two reasons. One, they weren't spies. Back about 5 years ago, they had a family member come out and say that they testified wrongly against them. Second, the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an idiot and a big fraidy cat. Because of his loonicy, too many people lost jobs wrongfully (and lives) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened.Besides, the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place. They were more of a threat to themselves.

1	We don't take him seriously anymore because despite having been refuted over and over (both here and on at least four other boards), he still posts the same garbage. Whenever it looks like there has been overwhelming refutation of his thread, he abandons it and starts a new one saying basically the same thing as the one before it. THAT is why he isn't taken seriously, and no, it is not "unfair". I also have to ask why you think he puts so much intelligence into his posts, when all he does is either cut and paste from some anti-evolution site, or say things like "science is a joke" My pet dog could do better.
1	You mean Intelligent Design, and straight forward logical, rational, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure... Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [oddly] convenient to how someone wants to live their life; amazing how that works out...
0	All of the British papers keep going on about how bad it is, how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets, how guns are being imported into Britain and resold through underground channels, how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage, etc.  Now who should we believe more, your or the papers that relate the news to us?
0	I believe it's there, but I'm certainly no one to push that belief on anyone.
1	Although I'm not keen on them describing things as living fossils (the term is misleading) the possibilities and implications of this are fascinating. I'd be interested to see the paper if anyone has a PDF. It would seem to suggest that the origins of this particular molecule go back to the Ordovician at least, prior to the reptile/mammal split. Anyway, thought people might be interested :)
1	Well, if intelligent design can come up with evidence, and a way to TEST it, rather than just saying 'This is too complicated, an intelligence must have done it', then maybe scientists would take it seriously.

1	What school child hasn't seen the sequential 5 or 6 pictures of a chimp, or ape, gradually turning into a man? How about all the scientific claims that man and chimps share a common ancestor? Abiogenesis strongly implies that there is no God, as does most of the dreams and theories of what has, and is, going on in outer space. If ID is not science, then none of the above is science, yet it is in today's science classes. 
1	Wrong again. A nervous system is required in order to feel pain. Many species of living-flesh animals have no nervous system and cannot feel pain of any description...crickets included.I do not know at what point the nervous system in a fetus is developed enough to transmit pain signals.
0	yes, and i suppose an idea of perfection can exist, in a thinker's mind, and subjective to the thinker's standards of perfection. i could also point out that an imperfect thinker, with no reference or standard of  objective  perfection, is incapable of having a perfect idea of anything. therefore the argument falls apart at the first premise, since an  idea of perfection  cannot exist, unless the thinker himself is perfect, which would make him God by his own definition.
1	Anti-AbortionHi, I'm brand new to this forum but not to abortion debates. I have been active in abortion debates for almost 20 years now. (not bragging, just providing some background) I started "online" debating even before the internet was available to the general public. We used a direct dial BBS called "FIDONET." (look it up on Wikipedia)I used to be "pro-choice" with regard to elective abortion.  and the legality thereof. I was of the (seemingly very common) belief that many people express; "I wouldn't personally want my child aborted,.. but who am I to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body?"Sound familiar?Long story, short? My views started changing in 1989 when an up and coming radio talk show host issued a challenge. He (Rush Limbaugh) said that he believed that "a persons life (rights) begins at and by their conceptionm,,, and he wanted someone to prove to him that it can possibly begin any other way."(I despised Rush Limbaugh)That challenge began my education process on the many abortion aspects and issues... and I have been actively involved ever since.I have already read through several of the threads (including this one) in this forum and I'm looking forward to participating,... and possibly incorporating it into my website. ChuzLife.net (under construction)

1	I heard that Harry Reid will allow Scott Brown to be sworn in before any more health care voting takes place. I just need to know if the liberals can sill find a way to pass this bill without the votes they need and without the support of the American People. Could they say, lie and rush through a vote in the middle of the night before Brown is sworn in?
0	That is irrelevent. One of the things that should always be hammered home to students in any science class is to never blindly accept what you are taught as fact, but to question and challenge it.  Of course religion is taught the same, no? You have been encouraged to question every verse in the Bible, to compare it to other religions, to question the evidence and the teacher at every stage, have you not? Of course not. You have been told to believe the Bible and to not question it, for it is  the word of God . I think that is the root cause of your problem. We aren't demanding that you accept evolution, geology, cosmology etc without question. Instead we are encouraging you to question, to doubt and to think for yourself. You can't deal with the lack of security that this approach offers.
0	Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!
1	You are on some different planet there. Science doesn't need one conclusion or the other. The traditional classification of neandertals has been Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, i.e., in the same species. Then genetic work suggested that neandertals were distinct enough to merit being a separate species [Hodges, S. B., 2000, Human Evolution: A start for population genomics. Nature (7 Dec. 2000): 408(6813):652-653.]. Results since then have been mixed. Some DNA work indicates a 5% admixture from Neandertals (Plagnol V, Wall JD, 2006, Possible ancestral structure in human populations. PLoS Genetics @ http://genetics.plosjournals.org/per...20105.eor&ct=1 ). Various fossils continue to suggest some interbreeding. (Note also that a genetic finding of no interbreeding does not conflict with fossilized hybrids - it merely says that any hybrids or hybrid lines ended up dying out before they contributed to any lineages that were successful all the way to the present.)A finding of 99.5 to 99.9% genetic similarity is what we expect, given the clear similarity of the two groups.

0	And...  You're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance, the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric, is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S.  The constitution was written after the declaration. Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration, they could have, yet they didn't, did they?  Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand, trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal, which it is, in the U.S., right now, should not be allowed.  TIP: Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise, else, your entire argument is just as flawed, which it is.  Abortion is legal, for the right reasons.  A conscious, human, U.S. citizen, has rights.  Cells, without consciousnes, that are not citizens, do not have rights, are not individuals, and are not humans.  You can jump up and down, and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance, but it doesn't boost your debate credibility.  -Mach
1	The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it.

Who are you recommending should use self-restraint?  The protestors?  Or are you saying, self-restraint is your recommendation for birth control?
0	OK. Marriage. Originally it was always between man and woman. Why is it all of a sudden changing? Sure you can have a relationship, that's not the main thing that bothers me. Marriage also consists of a nifty little tax break. I'm sorry, but I don't want to pay for that. I think the initial break was there to help raise a family. Until homosexual couples can have children, I don't want to fork that out of my paycheck.  They can legalize these marriages for all I care, but I'm not paying for them, and I'm sure other's don't want to either.  Also, homosexual has all of a sudden started to grow at an alarming rate. It's more than it used to be, and I don't think genetics have anything to do with it. It's learned. So if we keep teaching everyone that it's fine, then sure, we'll have more homosexuals. That's beside the point though.  Why are we all of a sudden questioning the definition of marriage? 50 years ago, no one would have thought otherwise. Man and Woman.  There are moral reasons (which I won't go into) but there are also scientifical reasons.  Others may disagree with me here
1	If you don't mind, could you just outline your paradigm please?  and also, when you say you have experience, do you mean in "real" debating (HS and College) or just on this and other sites?

1	President Obama has correctly characterized the Bill of Rights is a list of negative Rights against government.  The point is, that the only rights that the government, and or any anti-gunner, or department has, is the infringements we grant them through laws etc.  Taking the info in this article at face value. What was a legal practice to do just yesterday landed this guy in a jackpot for not knowing what or how the Govt. is going to interpret the law to mean today. This is a common problem with, and not to directly pick on the ATF, but gun dealers complain about this all the time. EVEN an FBI agent himself cannot predict, nor curry a favorable interpretation.  What kind of country and legal system do we want? Surely you can see that this kind of stuff is not in ANY WAY Shape of Form, fair to do to a Right that our Constitution says is Inalienable. Or to a person who was an impeccable reputation.  Would you like to be treated in this manner?  The article says, what he did is not illegal, but in the hands of someone with an axe to grind, maybe they didn?t like him, or maybe the prosecutor is Anti-gun etc, lands this guy in a jackpot!  Now can you see the problem with this?  I know lets apply all of this to computers! We will just make up any law as we go. How?d that be?

1	I thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of Jesus was in 4 B.C. Assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of Christ, how could Christ have been born Before Christ?
1	You are correct, but bear in mind it is just Bragg's introduction to the programme and not the opinion of the panel. This issue is explored in more detail when Dawkins talks about a population of self replicating molecules (27:00) and how the first life, as we define it would have arisen when there was concentration of these molecules and then the first cells- there is no suggestion of a single entity that was responsible for all subsequent life.  Thanks for the links on the articles btw.
1	I think a better question is what preserved their life for so long? It is the mercy of God that upholds and preserves people in this life. It is the sin of human beings that is responsible for death.
1	It isn't about truth. It is about explaining the evidence as best we can. You did get the second part correct about creationism. That is why some Christians are not creationists.
1	Thanks for the link it was an interesting read.I found the comment in the second to last paragraph most intriguing:'Scientists have also identified the smallest number of genes required to sustain life in a bacterial cell (about 350). If they can overcome the many technical hurdles of building a wholly artificial cell in the lab, it is conceivable they could "create" - albeit simple - "life". 'Who knows what that line of research might lead us to?
1	Has god left signs of himself in the physical world that we humans can see aside from the bible?
1	Would make, that is. However, not all members of the population are able to breed.Should we make this a thread for posting examples of natural selection? That might be fun.An example: rats are often a problem. The solution? Introduce rat poison.Unfortunately, some rats are immune to the poison. You should have guessed it- those rats reproduce, and the others don't (as much).Another: elephants use their tusks on predators and for ritual purposes (attracting mates). Some elephants lack tusks or have shorter tusks.However, when poachers kill the elephants with the biggest tusks, the elephants with smaller tusks (or no tusks) reproduce more.
1	Perhaps not,perhaps it should, if it can be shown there is no prior knowledge the two people have ever met.
1	Actually you are incorrect. I have heard this explanation before and at the risk of being rude its given by people who don't actually under stand what is meant by "testing a theory." You can not successfully test a theory. Once a theory has been successfully tested it is no longer a theory. When sceince refers to testing a theory it's a process of creating an experiment using what they do know to find out what they don't know, but it never proves the theory. It can often find another peice of the puzzle that when theorized can help support the theory, but that is not surprising given the theory was used as the experimental modul. As such the tests only provide additional information (or education) for the educational guess. Unfortuantly mathmatics and sceince use testing a theory in different ways and the layaman often confuses the two. In Mathematics it is possible to test and retest using different mathematical variables and come up with numerous examples of success and it still be a theory. The reason for this is that mathematics in itself is theoretical. By that meaning it is non-physical and can only be approximated. However such is not the case for science. I would not go so far as claim you are being equivocative because I think it’s ignorance not misrepresentation on your part. However, That’s the last I will talk about the term theory either people can accept the definition or not. Even if they disagree if they can not discuss within that frame work quite frankly they probably aren’t at the educational/critical level to discuss the concepts.If someone wants to prove me wrong simply give me a scientific theory that has been successfully tested.
1	So? The majority of most people aren't criminals, and follow most laws. How is this different?
1	Okay.  The best succinct representation of the scientific method is probably circular:  We make an observation about what we see.  We form a hypothesis based on our observation.  We perform an experiment to test the hypothesis.  We make an observation about what we see (in the experiment).  Rinse and repeat...  Now add a spur: after repeated refinement and confirmation of hypotheses, a theory is devised.
0	But felons can't vote and I don't see that in the Constitution, either.  I don't have a problem with preventing criminals from legally owning firearms. That said, I think it's against our rights to be assumed to be a criminal without ever being convicted of a crime.

A higher percentage of Americans are murdered every year than in any other  western  country save for N. Ireland (a region wracked by decades of near civil war, military occupation and terrorism).  Can you back up this claim?  Not true. The highest level of crime recorded in Florida was in 1988, the year after the concealed carry law was passed.  You have no evidence to back up that claim at all.

0	The pro-life position isn't even formost about the law. It is about stopping abortions, period. That is why so many pro-life people work in counseling centers, not legal offices. Your implication that pro-lifers do not vary in their views is just plain ridiculous--I myself am living proof that they do. I am certainly pro-life, but I don't oppose very early term abortions or when the life of the mother is in definite danger.

1	See above, yet again
1	Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?
1	What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).

1	Halton Arp is far from suppressed.  Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.  And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.  I'd say that if he is  suppressed  then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his  fireworks  universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this.  But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these  weird  redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away. The ones that can't are just curiosities. Then there isn't a systematic way to look for these things, so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching, which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time.

Lucky for us, we have great friends who want to plan it for us. But some details I feel we should decide.
1	again, please review the definition of an atheisthumor cannot be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm. it is an abstract and intangible quality. so is beauty, artistic ability and pleasure. yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist. an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence. they can be detected through mental processing, and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present.being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things. it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual/supernatural realm

He is a shining example of why I don't like guns but that doesn't mean I'm going to talk about him constantly.

1	You don't need an FFL to transfer an out of state  antique  firearm. I believe it is also OK for a minor to purchase and own an antique firearm. In addition, I believe the NFA doesn't apply to antique firearms. (Am I correct on that last one?)  So, zachvac can mail order a double barreled shotgun, saw the barrels short, and attach a pistol grip, legally.

1	lol....moths emerged with the correct colors to match their backgrounds. It has nothing at all to do with what moths might get eaten by birds or which don't. They're just like butterflies:  http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm  Monteiro noted that the differences in wing patterns differentiate one species of butterfly from another and are used by males and females to determine with which individuals to mate.  They also have been shown to serve an adaptive purpose, as demonstrated by numerous studies focusing on seasonal changes in wing coloration of individuals in a species.  For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.   Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,  she said.  The authors note that what's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time.  ------------------------------  The pepprered moth story is the biggest myth of all time. moths emerge physiologically according to background, predators and other external conditions:  http://ourfcs.friendscentral.org/mot...yphenism1.html  Many species of moths and butterflies are known to exhibit a seasonal polymorphism, where one form predominates at one time of year and an alternative form occurs in a different season. Some species also show differences in adult size between two seasonal forms. In some cases, the change in seasonal markings has been shown to correlate with temperature; in these instances it is believed that one color form can provide more rapid or effective solar heating through a larger proportion of darker patterns. In other cases, the seasonal forms are believed to be connected to a more effective cryptic ability according to the nature of available background surfaces.

1	Nice job not addressing anything I said.I am not a radical, just informed. I used to work for a sexual violence center and counseled rape victims in college. I am also a victim. Keeping myself up to date on sex crimes is important to me, partly because I want all that can be done to prevent it done. Pointing a finger at gays like this does not do that.

1	Check out the best load for the AR-15 thread, here were the gun collectors and owners is OK too. This is what we do with our guns. Go to the range shoot a little, hunt a little, and sit around and talk. We talk about wives, girlfriends, children, family, cars, fishing, politics, and of course guns and hunting.  We do not talk about robbing banks, raping women, stealing cars, selling drugs, or killing cops.  The gun owners here are HARMLESS and productive members of society. Felons are not.  The law must focus on the bank robbers, rapist, car jackers, dealers, and cop killers; and not on the harmless gun owners. That is why gun control as it is envisioned and practiced in this country is fundamentally wrong.

But this is all irrelevant since the baby didn't die and was born without complications.

And there is a caveat to your statement. Science makes some religious interpretations obsolete.
0	So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?
1	And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that?

1	Really . "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the LORD; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God. (NKJV)." Isaiah 40:3 "In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!' For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the LORD . . . (NKJV).'" Matt. 3:1-3 John the Baptist came before Jesus Christ and let people know that He was coming. What a fascinating period of history. This prediction was given by the prophet Isaiah, 740-680 B.C. History tell us that John the Baptist did in fact come preaching repentance and baptism. "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come . . . one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times (NIV)." Micah 5:2 " After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod . . . (NIV)" Matt. 2:1 Micah, 735 - 710 B.C., tells us that the Christ or Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. It is recognized by all that Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem. Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel (NKJV)." Isaiah 7:14 "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins . . . His name [is] Immanuel (NKJV)" Matt. 1:20-23. "This is what the LORD says: "A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more (NIV)." Jer. 31:15 "When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under . . .then the [prophecy] was fulfilled (NIV)." Matt. 2:16-4:1 Through the prophet Jeremiah, 627 - 580 B.C., God indicated that some of Israel's children would be killed at the coming of the Messiah. "When Israel was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son." Hosea 11:1 "Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him. When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son." (NKJV).'" Matt. 2:13-15 This prophecy was given by the prophet Hosea around 750 B.C. This amazing prophecy says that Messiah would come from Egypt. Jesus had to be born into the family of David, born of a virgin, born in Bethlehem, children would die and Jesus come out of Egypt. The prophet must have wondered why Messiah would come out of Egypt. This did not fit the concept the Jews had about Messiah. This is God's plan and these are God's prophecies. "They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots (NKJV)." Ps. 22:18 "Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: "They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots (NKJV)." Matt. 27:35 After the soldiers crucified Jesus (nailed Him to the cross), they gambled for Jesus' clothes. Little did they know they were fulfilling a 1000 years old prophecy. The prediction was provided by God through King David. "I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced (NKJV)." Zech. 12:10 "But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.For these things [occurred] that the Scripture should be fulfilled . . . "They shall look on Him whom they pierced (NKJV)." John 19:34-37 Another isolated event predicted in 520-512 B.C. In A.D. 33, some soldier thrust his spear into the side of Jesus to make sure that He would die before 6 pm that evening. Little did he realize that Jesus was already dead (John 19:30) and that he was fulfilling a 480 year old prophecy from Zechariah. "Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up His heel against me (NKJV)." Ps. 41:9 "Judas Iscariot . . . betrayed Him." Matt. 10:4"that the scripture might be fulfilled, 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me (NKJV)." John 13:21-28 This prediction was recorded by King David, 1020 - 970 B.C. It refers to the Messiah's betrayal by His friends. Judas is well known as the one who agreed to help the Romans capture Jesus at a cost of 30 pieces of silver. Peter was another who betrayed Jesus three times. "See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey (NIV)." Zech 9:9 "And the disciples . . . brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them garments, on which he sat. And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road (NIV)." Matt. 21:6-8 Zechariah, 480 - 470 B.C., stated that Messiah, the king, would come riding on a donkey. Donkeys were sometimes ridden in times of peace (Judges 5:10) but stallions were normally used by kings. This is unexpected by those looking for a military Messiah. If you want more just ask.
1	Well, at least the biological sciences and physics. The physicists also try to devise ways to keep their pet theories afloat so that the vast majority of the population can continue to be snow-blinded. Take their lie that there is some magical attraction between bodies of matter. The truth lies in Intelligent Falling - glory to the intelligent designer.

0	There is or ought to be a clear distinction between free speech and harrasment. There is a right to speak ones mind but no right to be heard. There is no right to harrass but stating an opinion, even if rudely, does not not constitute harrasment. Simply ignore what you don't wish to see or hear and you will be fine.
1	Well, I am a philosophical naturalist and materialist. I don't believe the notion of free will. I think it's all a matter of physics and chemistry.Be that as it may, whether I am right or wrong about the notion of free will, the consequences of evolution go beyond free will. They go well beyond what humans call good and evil, however we define those.How about disease, predation, parasitism? Are they the product of an omnibenevolent god? That thought gave Darwin pause. Pain and suffering through natural causes yet through no fault of one's own? How is that a product of a just god?There are aspects to real life -- some call them the problem of evil -- that are hard for Christians to explain, so many try to explain them away by creating the notion of "the Fall". Everything was perfect before "the Fall", and terrible afterwards. But that wasn't the way it was. The lion was never an herbivore. The lamb was never fearless of lions.Pain, suffering and death have always been an integral part of life, and they always will be.Such benevolence. Such justice! And so potent is this toxic religious belief we feel we have to blame outselves for our trials! Or at least, religious believers feel they have to blame themselves.As an atheist, I see the contradiction between reality and Christian faith. That is why I stopped being a Christian. My learning of evolution and these biological facts of life was a major ingredient in that. I accept that there are Christians who also accept evolution as an historical fact. I question whether they have thought either their faith or their science through.
1	Well, to be  scientific  means that it must be falsifiable. Otherwise it is meaningless in a regime of methodological naturalism.

1	To me, part of the point of the  please, no scripture  comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to.  A person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on Father's Fay, but I would argue that it's not reasonable to do so in every case. For example, if the father was physically or sexually abusive, or the father abandoned his children, those would be reasons to fore-go any Father's Day formalities.  And  God  could be viewed as the absent father. Suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth. What's his involvement been since then?  Should we worship him just because he's God?  Or, depending upon how one sees God, is God a being unworthy of worship and idolization?  And along those lines, utilizing the Bible as a reference could be a double-edged sword. The  God  of the Old Testament ordered slavery, misogyny, genocide, women as spoils of war, ...

1	Evidence isn't peer reviewed.(*-see correction below)  Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what's peer reviewed.  And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't  proven  anything.  The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.  Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered.  The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.  There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians.
0	You're going to have to do a better job of explaining why. Mostly you talk gibberish.
0	No one really dragged anyone, marc.I was doing what is called "making a joke." You need a sense of humor to understand this.The idea behind the humor was that it seems that in 2008 any person or institution that does not understand that evolution is a fact is indeed backward in their thinking. In that they finally recognized a commonly accepted fact so late, it would seem they were hitherto reluctant. Hence the "kicking and screaming" reference.Sheesh, if you have to explain it...
0	While I'm still iffy on her with the whole New Haven case, and her off-the-bench comments on race, this is one thing I commend her for and agree completely with.
1	Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us.  What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable.
0	You need to read the whole article before you make such statements. The point of the article is that the provisions for divorce that are available to heterosexual married couples are NOT available to same-sex married couples because of the discriminatory federal law (DOMA) and because of state laws that do not recognize same-sex marriage, thus not allowing for legal divorce.  Read the whole article and see what you think. Shouldn't all married couples have access to equal rights and provisions for division of property when they divorce?
1	Apparently pretty narrow interpretation, and not one of the "priviledges and immunities" of citizens. Handguns for the purposes of lawful self-defense in the home. That appears to be what the Second Amendment now protects.
1	It's true, I find the story on sites that are generally anti-bush. However, this was a radio show transcript, not a site. Larry Flint says "'I've talked to the woman's friends,' Flynt said. 'I've tracked down the doctor who did the abortion, I tracked down the Bush people who arranged for the abortion,' Flynt said. 'I got the story nailed." I haven't seen it either confirmed or denied by anyone more reputable.

1	Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.  We're waiting to hear about three or four more.  As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want.

1	Actually, none of those are predictions that creationism makes, and what's more, they're all disprovable. Biochemists estimate we're within ten years of creating life from non life. Prepared to chew on that foot?The logical leap you're making here is that if we assume creationism is true, evolution and abiogenesis must be false, and that's silly. It's actually possible for all three to be true. God could have the ability to create life, but perhaps God never did so and allowed life to arise through natural processes. Moreover, suppose God created the first life and allowed it to evolve from that. None of these possibilities are inherently contradictory to anything but a specific reading of a specific holy book.

1	And can you provide a citation from the Constitution that supports the notion that a President can send the military half-way round the world without a declaration of war from Congress?Come now. To call an issue "settled law" is, as someone else pointed out, to emphasize stare decisis, i.e. "to stand by what has been decided," i.e. to recognize the binding nature of precedent. This is why, in those rare cases where long-standing precedents are overturned, it's such a big deal: the court essentially admits that it had been wrong.As to so-called "judicial activism" -- and again as someone else pointed out -- to emphasize stare decisis is preciesly the opposite of "judicial activism." With regard to Roe itself, what I find remarkable is that the court exercised so much restraint: the justices explicitly refused to make a declaration about when life begins. They explicitly claimed not to have any qualifications to make such a decision, and they noted that even those who examine the issue thoroughly -- scientists and physicians, theologians and philosophers -- are nowhere near a consensus on the matter. So they decided not step in and settle such metaphysical questions.Indeed, it is ultimately individuals whom the court allowed to make this decision as they see fit. And so, they based the decision on the right to privacy. Said right is not explicit in the Constitution, but that doesn't matter (see the Ninth Amendment for why). And said right is also not absolute (as the decision again explicitly says): it is limited in this case by the state's compelling interest in protecting prenatal life (a point which is often overlooked by all sides in the abortion debate), and that interest is directly proportional to the viability of the fetus. But what Roe clarified is that any law establishing the protection of prenatal life as an unconditional trump of the mother's right to privacy is unconstitutional. Within reasonable limits, she herself gets to decide when life begins, and to act accordingly.Like I said, judicial restraint. And a stunning example of defending the individual from government interference or social discrimination in matters of conscience, to boot.
1	You must have been watching the same sunday morning tv political talk show as I was semi-listening to this morning. Some pro-abortion woman went off on a tangent about the phrase  abortion on demand .  Would  abortion for convienence  be more accurate?
1	Here is the first LIE and rewriting of history by a proponent of gay marriage. If anyone actually studies the civil rights movement they will plainly see that it was the southern democrats who plunged us first into the civil war under Lincoln's administration by attempting succession rather than freeing the slaves, and it was the DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS who fought civil rights legislation right up to the 60s before finally passing a weaker bill than was submitted by a Republican at the time. Al Gore Senior was one of the loudest opposers of civil rights. And was George Wallace and Governor Patterson, Governors who refused to honor or enforce equal rights after passage, Republicans or a Democrats? For you children from Rio Linda, they were Democrats. They fought desegregation at every level of the process.
1	A lot of people have taken issue with  the woman's health  phrase as a caveat due to the fact it is so vague. I tend to think it is too vague to be reasonable. If specific standards were put in place as to determine at what point such a phrase is violated, then I might be more open to it. Because  health of the mother  could be so wide-open to interpretation, it would be an allowance for abortion that would basically have no meaning and significance. And that is, I think, one reason the pro-choice lobby wanted such phraseology.  Yeah, I certainly think it's a good ruling. IMO there is no reason (other than the life of the mother) to do such a horrible thing to a late-term fetus.
0	Really if this is another one of your fresh organic sample = age of decades of time capsule because they were both on top of the ground, you're officially delusional.

1	I wonder what the 2nd DOES grant then.... Any answers to that, VoR?
1	They affect you too.I must quote again..."The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies, linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation. But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution."Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) "Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction", p12.I have been at pains to quote this, not because their work is in the field of epistemology (for when I post evidence, from epistemological sources, I get the reaction I just got from you; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists!' These evolutionists recognise the variety of influences, not all affecting us all on a conscious level. You simply ignore this evidence and present a statement that you don't believe it.Further I find it odd people should demand that I cease quoting from outside sources to back up my statements.
0	And you remind me of the people in the year 1900 who said man would never be able to build a flying machine.
1	There is a pretty huge difference.  Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.  I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.  The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.
1	Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.
1	Because it's a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it.
1	Well, as Jaaman see it, Heaven does forbid it!I myself am getting worried, look at Virgina. They have enacted law that stops even relationship contracts and healthcare for gays and lesbians. If that were to happen in my state, my parter would loose his healthcare because it is from my work. (He is self-employed). I read where people will just move to states where they feel accpeted, then others will move to states with laws that agree with their beliefs. Soon we will be a divided country.
0	No, it's ALL of Canada which has legal marriage for same-sex couples! This is great news about California! But I had to correct that point, being Canadian. I do remember how I felt the day our most populous province, where I live, Ontario, made me an equal citizen. Soon the rest of Canada, followed. I wish the same for Californians and Americans. It's a wonderful feeling, hard to describe!
0	So let's see if we've got this right.  You're in favor of a procedure that's going to bog down the legal system even more, possibly bringing it to an outright and immovable standstill, by prosecuting people for having an unregistered firearm...while at the same time dropping felon in possession in charges against violent criminals that actually employ violence their victims to get what they want?  How do you intend to catch people to prosecute them?
1	I think that laws, like history, are written by the victors. Victory has historically justified many crimes comitted by those who win the power to absolve themselve of the inhumanity they exhibited in their struggle for power. The Second Amendment does not negate laws prohibiting homicides. If David Koresh had possessed the courage to survive his encounter at Waco, then he would have been perfectly free to appear before the tribunal of his victorious adversary and defend himself in court on the grounds that his actions were protected by the Second Amendment and/or a right of self defense. I sincerely doubt, however, that you could ever find 12 people who would accept his defense. My vote would certainly go against him.Where I am from, we still refer to the Civil War as the "War of Northern Aggression." But my state entered that contest with the immoral goal of preserving slavery, and I will not attempt to justify her actions through the citizen's RKBA. She fought a long and glorious struggle which I believe is forever tainted by its immoral purpose. She was vanquished, and no one who answered her call to arms was ever permitted to use the Second Amendment as a shield from the wrath of the victor.
1	And from the Egyptians.  I was skimming through a book last night called  101 Myths of the Bible  (IIRC) that explained how the Creation myth in Genesis (and many other myths in the Bible) was a modified form of Egyptian (and possibly, Bablylonian, etc. - I can't remember) mythologies.

0	So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?
1	"The"? There is no single interpretation of the ToE. There is a debate going on between supporters of Punctuated Equilibrium and Gradualism, for example. It doesn't matter that this website asserts that this one interpretation is accepted.I don't think I accept it, but I don't know for sure, as you seem to have chosen a website which is unclear on some points. (Of course, the websites that are not unclear don't often support your point of view...)
1	The "study" fails to do this. It offers a philosophical "proof" only, as the scientific method is not used in any way in the "study".
1	Yes. (In a way.) We are "in" the same thing that existed way back then. It has just expanded since then, so it's much bigger now.   .
1	Except that that would be the author's words, not a direct quote. Notice the absence of quotation marks? Special Agent Newell never said "17% came from the US". The author has as much trouble with the stats as you. 17% of the total have been traced to the US. We don't know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable. See the difference?
0	I think you mean things like the tax structure for filing as a married couple or maybe the social security benefits? I think that when these systems were being set up, there was(is) the mentality that a married couple is a family and that the  rights  of a married couple are the same rights as that of blood relations.  What's going on now with the gay marriage stuff is simply to get their marriage to be legally recognized so that they can have certian  rights  when it comes to things like social security and inheritance, etc.
1	Yes Ethmi, that is why abortion is not legal at nine months :xbanghead .
0	I note that you consider yourself irrational, though I could not possibly comment. There are times that I am grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the Atlantic, but then I allow for your need to identify with your adopted home and reject the motherland.You flatter yourself in assuming that you were any part of my considerations when choosing to post. The button reference is a play on words known as a pun.
1	Well, evolution says that everything evolved over "millions of years", correct? Let's say it takes a certain species 1 million years to evolve. That means that every 100 years of its "evolving process" we should be able to see 1,000 mutations! In the last 100 years, what SPECIES have we seen evolve 1,000 times? (Into an entirely new species, no less.)
0	Then, how much money should spend on the war on terror? Should we bankrupt the country to do it? Is it necessary to spend so much that we go bankrupt, or is it better to wisely spend the money we have and to fight an intellegent war against terror?
1	And what is the full quote? Was it talking about, lets say for example, tutles, where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood?  In many species, that is true. The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has.
1	Really? And how do you come to this conclusion? Are there a lot of teen-age suicide notes that complain of being rearranged pondscum? And what does "rearranged pondscum" have to do with evolution, anyway?
1	The mechanism, according to biologists, is a random mutation that would usually not reproduce much, but reproduces when the rest of the bacteria are removed. The mutation becomes a standard gene at this point.
1	Excuse me, but you didn't fully read what he wrote. He didn't say that he supported abortion. He said that he wasn't as much a freak about it as you're being.
1	Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing.   Why didn't YOU cite them?
0	Baby can be used to describe a human fetus. Get over it.
1	More lies. I mentioned genetics and observed instances of speciation, yes?
1	I've heard this type of statment before and it doesn't seem to hold water. Opposing abortion is not a political view, its a moral view and children are subject to their parents moral views from day one until they are adults. Its called parenting.
1	Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated. If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.  Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea. Thefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators, although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts. Why's that?  What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?
1	The Due Process Clause is cited in response to the pro-life assertion that the gov't should have the power to force a woman to donate bodily resources against her will and without her consent.
1	But creation isn't a theory and it's definitely not science. And science isn't based on assumptions and extrapolations. Perhaps you should take a science course. Science is based on observation, hypothesis, prediction, and testing.
0	While your story is a sad one I disagree that you should be happy with having a  second chance . I believe this because you gave your unborn child no chance.  I probably shouldn't say  you  because it seems like you didn't have a choice in the matter.  Anyway, thank you for sharing your story and welcome to the forums.

0	Actually, the one I find the most interesting is that 73% in Colorado voted AGAINST an amendment stating that life begins at conception.
0	I think the answer to that is much like J.P. Morgan's famous retort when someone asked him how much his yacht cost. 'If you have to ask, you can't afford it'. I'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons couldn't afford them, but if the interest isn't already there, it's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question.
1	Just because 99% of astrophysicists believe that the earth orbits the sun, why should you? Just because 99% of medical doctors believe that germs cause disease, why should you? Just because 99% of geologists believe that plate subduction causes vulcanism, why should you? (I know I lost you on that one.) Just because 99% of physicists believe that the sun produces energy by nuclear fusion, why should you? And that's why I don't consult my plumber or my mechanic about plantar fasciitis. What do you know that makes you better informed than thousands upon thousands of scientists who have spent decades of study in their subject. But you, who hasn't read a single book or paper have done a "detailed study" (of course with an open mind) and concluded that you are right and they are wrong. Moreover, you think that the terminally ignorant should be allowed to vote on science.
0	Oh, I would wager about like Mexico, about 80% fewer than guestimated. Funny you would ask that when the puts the finger squarely on gangs. How is that drug war working out in Mexico or Canada for that matter. Think the gangs are for smuggling dope or guns? What causes the problems? Dope but they also have guns. I wonder how a national dope registry would work
1	Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.
1	So you define religion as the following:  1) Testable  2) Based on Experiments  3) Based on empirical evidence  4) Open to change based on experiments and new evidence  5) Validity based on facts, rather then Faith  If evolution is a religion, so is Chemistry.

1	Well, an abortion can't technically be called 'fetal homicide' because it isn't illegal... homicide is. If a woman kills her toddler, that is homicide, and it isn't legal, and I don't see how it ever could/would be... all murder is illegal, but to call an abortion murder is really only your personal opinion on the issue, because as of now it is a legal procedure. Some people consider it to be murder, and some don't.. it isn't an open and shut thing either way; if it were, there wouldn't be so much debate over it, and if it were considered to be murder all around, no questions, then it would not be legal. Maybe the laws will change someday, who knows.. but right now it's not illegal for a woman to have an abortion. You can call it a double standard, but again that is mainly just opinion.But I also have had friends who have had abortions because they didn't want to 'get fat'.. I know of one girl who had 7 by the time she was 22... that is pretty disturbing, and I don't think that it's really right to do it for reasons like that... like I said to her, if she were so afraid of getting pregnant, or getting 'fat', she should have either not had sex or she should have used protection... there are ways to prevent pregnancy, and birth control costs a hell of a lot less than an abortion (especially 7 times).. but at the same time I also had a friend who got pregnant, and got scared, and made an appointment to a clinic, and once she got there she didn't think she could go through with it, and now she has a healthy, adorable 5 year old and she is very thankful that she didn't have the abortion after all... but in the cases of my friends, all I could do was offer an opinion if they asked, but I didn't feel I had the right to tell them what to do either way. You really can't know what is going on in a woman's mind when she is considering an abortion, or after she has had one done.

1	Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really.
1	Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says "animals don't have souls."So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).

1	Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?

1	No, because it would have been the actions of only one man, Adam. It wasn't just one tribe that evolved into humans - it would be hundreds of inviduals inacting with each other and the environment. Also the trouble is that there wouldn't have been a concious mutation (that would have occured somewhere at the frog level if not before), its not conciousness that is humanity's unique talent - its the level of pattern recognition and abstract thinking. Its not even really a unique talent, just a much more complicated version of what pretty much everything else has - where the line is going to be drawn for the purposes of a Fall is going to get difficult.  Unless of course you start taking sections merely as metaphors and in some cases purely primative myth, whilst still beleiving the general messages. But then if you do that then you are on logically shaky ground but never had a problem with evolution in the first place.
1	This single sentence takes the whole train off the tracks into a huge train wreck of logic. This implies that the probability of a mutation should be calculated after the fact because evolution is progress along some specified path towards a goal. What a foolish, foolish assertion. Why is a single  perfect  mutation required as opposed to one of millions that take place in a population at every generation that may offer a slight reproductive advantage? As Gould often asked, do  historical patterns of development represent a set of mechanically limited and excellent, perhaps even optimal, designs,  or  do they represent just one possible solution among numerous entirely plausible alternatives of strikingly different form, each yielding a subsequent history of life entirely different from the outcome actually experienced on earth?  (Gould, Stephen Jay. 2002. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. p. 1159) Thus, the likelihood of a mutation is not determined because subsequent evolution would have been impossible without it. The mutation preceded the path of evolution. There was no goal towards which evolution was aimed.  Ted Dace (not a scientist), Bertvan, and ww all seem to have evolutionary theory backasswards.

0	But, now simone is in a pickle. Is there an explanation as to why police officers carry these things? (OH! Now we switch to the purpose of the USER! How convenient! I wish I could determine that an item is bad using one train of logic, and then SWITCH LINES OF LOGIC to suit my argument!I will bet that simone will choose to COMPLETELY IGNORE MY POST because I am removing all lines of dishonest "logic switching". (or, at least attempting to)Rather than admit wrongness, (very hard to do once a person has so vehemently commited themselves to an agenda) there is no other choice than to follow the trail of that path to the end. Even if the path leads to a land of complete logical make believe and you are thereby forced to defend your chosen agenda even if it means temporarily making logical "detours". After all, if objects have no inherent evil or goodness, it must be the character of the USER and the chosen purpose of the USER that determines the ethical value of how an item is used.If this is so, you can't call guns bad. This determination can not be admitted on the path simone has chosen. Therefore, since simone's agenda insists on the inherent evilness of an object (a gun) there MUST be some logical deviation to explain why these "evil" items are not "evil" when used by police. If there is no logical deviation on a path that is in error, you will have no choice but to arrive in error's destination: make believe land! Where matches burn down houses! And knives cause slashings! And candle holders cause bashed in skulls!....AND......AND.....GUNS CAUSE SHOOTINGS!Well, simone. We're down to brass tacks. Is a gun bad, or is it the determination of the person who uses it?Because if a gun is bad, then we live in la-la land. And if a gun is an inanimate object who's user is responsible for how it is used, you have no argument for why law abiding people can't posess them and be capable of the determination (As police do) for using them in a responsible manner. Just like matches, or cars, or candle holders.So, simone............
1	The "truth" about atheism is that it's the only proposition that makes sense (apart from agnosticism ?) to people who conclude, as I do, that religious principles are not based on reason.I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with "divine service", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, "Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !" , and I had received no such gift. Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist.

1	The biggest for our local LE. Our sheriff says almost all of his federal funding is tied one way or another to marijuana with almost zip for crystal meth, the current problem drug. And every local LE person I know doesn't consider marijuana a dangerous drug.What's funny is our state government outlawed over-the-counter sale of some of the primary ingredients for cooking crank in an effort to combat it on the cheap. Yep, all those ingredients are now smuggled in, reducing local retail revenue and we've also experienced an increase of cheap Mexican crank on the street.Interestingly enough, OR is a state that allows personal pot cultivation for medicinal purposes by MD prescription. As those prescription holders are on record, DEA makes regular inspection rounds of their residences to make sure they aren't exceeding the legal limit of six mature and six immature plants. LE tax dollars at work. Everyone wonders how long it will be before the feds attempt invoking the sleazy interstate commerce catch-all to eliminate that states right. Since Ashcroft the Evangelist is no longer driving dark ages federal moral legislation, maybe there's a chance that won't happen.
1	The words "reality" and "have to" should never have been added to that sentence.The reality is, bats could have evolved echolocation as a navigating tool, and learned to apply it to hunting and communication later. After all, all three uses require the same "hardware": an organ to generate the sonar, and an organ to receive it.
1	Yes, I know what it is. I also know of mothers who have never breast-fed.Are you trying to imply that, because a baby is sometimes breast-fed, it retains a biological connection to the mother similar to the umbilical cord? I'd call that stretching the boundaries of 'biological connection', personally...Before birth, if the mother dies, the foetus dies (with one noticable exception that I know of). After birth, this is no longer the case.

1	Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state. IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.
1	Actually, the Second Amendment doesn't say anything about due process. It does not say that people on a terror watch list can not be prohibited from buying weapons, but the right can be infringed with due process of law. In fact, the Second Amendment says nothing about the circumstances under which it can be infringed. One scholar comments on the implications of this for the individual rights interpretation:"If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park, guns in hand.[185] Anyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House, or any other federal building...The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances, while the Second, if read as an individual right, does not."Chicago-Kent Law Review18th Century Pennsylvania, which had its own RKBA, passed a law which required citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the state or face being disarmed. This was to protect the state against those who might be loyal to the British Crown. So why can't the US take similar measures to protect itself against terrorists?
1	Yes but Paul said sin makes people love bad and seek evil. People love others to do good, but hate to do good unless they see a reward. Catholics had to steal hellfire to scare all the converts from not caring if they went to heaven. Take away hell and heavenly bliss what do most people see as a reason for worshiping god?  People hate totalitarian governments yet God advocates one. Except for the middle east nobody is preaching the virtues of a church state anymore. The only reason really to worship god may be for social change. If enought people convert to a single denomination they can live the way they think is best with out being humiliated or worse.
1	100%In order for a round to be considered "armor piercing", it has to have a penetrator. As long as you are not using .223 with a penetrator, you have NO legal issues at a federal level. That particular round penetrated EVERY piece of body armor that we tested with the exception of the new stuff we were testing. The new stuff is a composite, a ceramic metal matrix shell over a honeycomb carbon composite. I weighed 85 lbs, so it is not something that you are going to see guys running around in (though I do have several sets that we constructed for the testing that I could sell for around $200,000.00 each). You MIGHT have feed problems (we did) with the round, in which case you need to take a dremel and smooth out your feed ramp. No big deal. Out of a makarov (short barrel) we were getting around 2850 FPS. Out of a bizon (15 inch barrel) we were at about 3000 FPS, well into rifle velocity land. The REAL benifit to a round like this (since I assume that most people are not simply looking to load cop killers) is that you have in inherently stable round, the .223, being fired at near rifle velocity, from a pistol. The round is stable to roughly 150 yards, then it begins to deteriorate. 3" groupings at 100 yards with our old POS test weapon were not uncommon. 1.5" with the bizon.
1	Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.

Diet alone is clearly not the determining factor on why any given species made it through the ice age.

1	One cannot have a controled experiment, as one can in the hard sciences. Psychology, anthropology and other disciplines also do not allow for controlled experiments. However, as with these other fields, one can do a detailed analysis of events that do occur to see if there is a common trend. For example, if people claim to see a supernatural event, take them aside separately to question them about the details. If one can be sure that they didn't get a chance to coordinate the details ahead of time and, nevertheless, the details match, then that would be evidence supporting the supernatural. If this happens consistently, then it would start giving strong support to the existence of a supernatural.Unfortunately, though there are occasional events that remain unexplained, we all know that the great majority of events have not resulted in any conclusive evidence of a supernatural and often they are shown to be simply fraudulent or due to psychological misinterpretation. Since so many of these claims about the supernatural have proven to be dead ends, it is understandable that people should automatically be wary of anyone's claim toward supernatural proof, which has led to the very subject being essentially taboo in intellectual circles. That is unfortunate. If there actually was a supernatural and did manifest itself, then it might never be discovered because any genuine evidence presented would be automatically ignored because of the taboo.The main challenge is to have the patience to weed through the thousands of bogus claims in the hope of finding something genuine - whether or not that hope ever gets fulfilled.
1	Let's give credit where credit is due. Science taught that the world was the centre of the universe. The leading scientists convinced churchmen to take allegorical passages of the Bible and re-interpret them as literal. The ancient Greeks, who were esteemed in Europe as the pre-eminent scientists of their day believed this.They also believed that people were made up of four elements. And taught this.Scientists backed up racism"No rational man (writes Thomas Huxley, a contemporary evolutionist), cognizant of the facts, believes that the average Negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the white man. And if this be true, it is simply incredible that, when all his disabilities are removed, and our prognathous relative has a fair field and no favor, as well as no oppressor, he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger-brained and smaller-jawed rival, in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites."

The first link does not suggest that man arose in China. It is a discussion of a primate fossil. While humans are primates, all primates are not necessarily humans. The article discusses a primate fossil, the oldest yet discovered. It does not claim that mankind arose in China.Your second link leads to a discussion of well known human fossils from the middle pleistocene or later. None of them are as old at the Australopithecine fossils of Africa. Maybe you didn't read you own links, but I don't see any claim of the origin of mankind in China. The claim is that early hominids (Homo erectus) migrated to China from Africa. The oldest H. erectus fossils are found in Africa and it would therefore seem that that is the origin of the species.

Again, my apologies, but prs has no idea of the difference between Lamarckian and Darwinian theory, and how that theoretical difference would be reflected in different social theories. As far as I can tell prs has nothing but preconceived misconceptions about this. I felt compelled to speak up. Hope you're not put out about my intrusion.
0	So Steeeeve, as you have made no response in over a month I'll take your answer to my last question as a yes: More AIDS deaths are an acceptable trade for reducing access to abortion.  If you disagree, I'm all ears as to your justification.
0	I think this is the crux of our disagreement. In my line of reasoning, I believe since criminals are obviously using firearms, the refusal to allow lawful citizens the same means of defense is unreasonable and unfair.Good people are required to "bring a knife to a gunfight". (i.e. disproportionate response)While I believe that any law abiding citizen should be able to have access to the means to defend themselves, I think a reasonable compromise is possible between our two sides.How's this: Instead of a complete ban, you concede that civilian gun ownership is a good thing and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for personal protection.Instead of lassiz' faire "guns for all who want them", I'll concede that a strict regimen of licencing and training/qualification for those who wish to purchase. (In the U.K. Although this is reasonable, I'm not going for it in the U.S. This would be a HUGE concession to government control here.)A strict licencing/registration scheme would be allowing for MORE freedom in the U.K. It would be tightening a "Nazi-like" noose around our necks here in the U.S.If you are being burned at the stake, lethal injection sounds like a wonderful alternative. If you are walking down the sidewalk, it's not quite as peachy.
0	Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman.
0	She is still a very loud activist.
0	Truth be told, the mayor is grand standing for the Supreme Court in order to try ans sway their decision to allow them to continue their clearly unconstitutional gun ban! He doesn't want the National Guard any more than he wants a plague to come into the city of Chicago.  He is like a little child holding his breath in hope that he can get what he wants.
0	Virtually anything!
1	Well some call me liberal (VoR anyone?) and I am definately pro-choice, I'll chime in here. I completely agree that in Roe v. Wade they made the wrong decision. I think ammendment X comes into play here. Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for the federal government to make restrictions based on abortion. This should be up to the states. Now on that same note it is also unconstitutional for the federal government to make a law banning abortion. This is a law that should be addressed by the states as it is not resered to the federal government.
1	Well, if some of the implications of quantum theory are correct (and don't quote me on this), then some of those things are actually possible. However, as any scientist worth his/her salt will tell you, just because something is possible doesn't mean it's definite. I don't see any proof of those things happening any time soon, either, but they're fun to think about, aren't they?
1	No. In 1996 there was a shooting massacre in Port Arthur, in the countries south. The new government had just been voted in, and it was their first act, right on the back of this massacre, to tighten gun laws up significantly. Riding on the back of public horror at the massacre, it was rushed through, approved by both the upper and lower houses, and made law.
0	No, but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition.
0	Well that explains your anger.:p   I hope you are blessed with homeliness.:) Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now?
1	And why do you pick that point? What makes fusion an individual? It doesnÂ’t start growing just because it was fused into a cell.
1	Well, we really don't know. However we do know that the woman has self conscious, and feels pain. Something the fetus lacks. She also can interact with other human beings, and develop relationships and attachments. Another thing the fetus lacks. Phisically, she is larger and much more capable than the fetus, and has a formed brain. Another thing the fetus lacks.  In conclusion, we really don't know. But, we do know that the woman can do, feel, and become more than a fetus is.
0	So then the handgun ban did absolutely nothing. Nice to see you could finally admit the truth.
1	I'm new to this idea that science has over-ruled Creation. Please explain.
1	No they're not....do zoos document the changes in phenotype that no-doubt occur? This is not the zoo's job -- their job is not experimentation on animals -- that's science's job. Besides that, zoos do their darndest to house the animals in habitats that mimic the animals' natural settings.  SS: 2) Show me one instance of science testing/disproving lamarckian-style inheritance.
1	Is this debate, either audio, video, or transcription, available on line, or will it be? I have bee a bit occupied in preparing for a tropical storm (possible hurricane) that turned out to be a fizzle (3.2 inches of rain over 10 hours and maybe 30 mph winds at worst). I'm dying to know if Comfort brought up the banana. It has always been my understanding that bananas (as well as cucumbers) were perfectly suited to other purposes. At least, I was told that it was the case by certain less than reverent female acquaintances when I was in college.
1	For what it's worth, I certainly AM bothered by this if it's true. I'd like to see the source where you got that information about the abortion rate climbing under Bush's presidency, if you would. Of course, we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time.
1	Well, two things here  1) No one has ever said that Evolution asserted that we know everthing about complexity.  2) The discovery institue, which publishes that list, basicallyi gave a poll out, then after responses, changed the wording of it. Basically, it's a lie.
1	What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes  conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms  per Heller.  If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift.
0	And if people have a  religious belief  whereby they don't think blacks should vote, or that interracial marriage should occur, should governmental officials who have those  religious beliefs  just be allowed to ignore their duty?  What if I had a religious belief that prevented me from performing my governmental tasks for Christians? Should that be respected as well?  They are paid to do their job. People who get to pick and choose what their  job  should entail because of their religious beliefs should find another form of work.  If when I was in the military, I had suddenly stood up and said,  Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.   Should that be respected and I keep my  job ?
0	What I'm saying is, if the police are going to abandon you, and the law prohibits you from protecting yourself with deadly force, what defense do you have should somebody decide that they're going to victimize you?  Exactly what kind of qualifications are you going by in declaring a nation  developed  if the government is unable to protect you, and they've actually made it a crime to try and protect yourself during your time of need?
1	No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method.
0	Oh so EVERYTHING except creation works without His help, I get it emoticon_rolleyes God makes everything. So God made our minds, and God made the scientific ideas that come into our minds, so God helped us understand all the things we do about science. Bu

0	Seer, dude,.. chill.I'm on your side.I mis-spoke. I don't follow your "womb trapped child" line of reason. It's not a comment about anything other than the fact that I haven't put much thought into it.Relax a bit and take a deep breath.Try to realize that not all who are sceptical about your posts are your enemies.
1	The reason no one corrected him is because he wasn't wrong. Canis is the genus, lupus is the species-Canis lupus is a wolf. Canis familiaris is a domesticated dog.
1	Because the purpose of the US Bill of Rights is to grant or guarantee rights, not to prohibit or curtail personal freedoms.
1	Are you suggesting that if abortion were banned that abortion clinics that are already done will flood the US? Please, get real here. People would probably go across the bordor and get abortions there...you might have drugs from canada come over that cause abortion but there is no reason to believe this will "clog" up the jails. People need to realize that is was only 30yrs ago that abortion was pretty much illegal (in most states). Did you see prisons flooded ? no.
1	#1 - Evolution continues today. Some organisms evolve relatively quickly. It has and is being observed. Do some research.  #2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena. It must have happened by itself if there is no Creator. There are several theories about the specifics. I happen to think lightning was involved.  #3 - It is thought humans evolved  away  from the other apes due to environmental pressures. When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate. That change in climate forced our ancestors from the trees which somehow contributed to our  rapid  and unprecedented brain development.  #4 - Geology and radioactive isotopes.
0	Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem. I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year. What school are you at?
0	I have to agree with you. The Mother is usually the one responsible for conceiving the baby. The man should be responsible too, but she's the one who will get pregnant and she has to consent to sex. I don't think a woman should have the right to do what she likes with her body and kill her baby whenever she gets pregnant. I think the responsibility rests with the Mother first in this case, and the baby should not die for her.
1	I know. Thus the "wink" smilie.
0	And down the road abit don't be surprised if you see Sunday Blue Laws being enacted to enforce worship on Sunday! All in the name of giving man a rest from toil of course!
1	You would do yourself a favour to drop it permanently. Nobody who understands the second law of thermodynamics believes it precludes the possibility of complexity increasing at a given place.
0	agreed your ideas are preaty cool
1	Actually they are what make us animals. It's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human.There is no precise definition as to what it is that makes someone a person. An in-fetu fetus are not a person IMO even though they may well have a brain, nervous system and organs.
0	So is it immoral to kill a human, moral to kill an ape, and somewhat immoral to kill a human/ape hybrid? How about a human with tomato genes spliced in to have shinier skin, is it a bit better to kill them? As far as I know there is no  person gene  per se.  I'm really thinking planet of the Apes here, is it right for the apes to enslave Charlton Heston because he's not Ape? Or would it be right for a bunch of humans to enslave Cornelius on the grounds he isn't human, even though  he can talk ?
1	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.
1	Yes and no  Yes and no  Yes and no  All are saved as there is no hell  Would you kill or burn your child if they did these things? what part of unconditional love and love without end do you not understand?  Faith is enough  That just it you don't have to do anything. Grace can not be given or taken away by anything you do or don't do.  And he said,  Let me tell you a secret about a father's love,  A secret that my daddy said was just between us.   He said,  Daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.   --- George Straight
1	so what if flagella parts are effected by a change of genes?....so are fly wings. The challenge was to present me any evidence that mutations can actually create new raw material for selection. You have to get out of the swamp somehow.I think this concept of mutations as being creators has gotten a pass for too long now.
0	So, because she's bigger, she can kill the fetus off? That is generally the idea the school yard bully has.
0	You mean a strawman logic fallacy, right? Yeah that would require me using a statement...not a question. But at least you tried.
1	Well, it is interesting to not that two of the five researchers have ties to the abortion industry. One of them runs an abortion clinic; another formerly served as an attorney for NARAL. Neither researcher disclosed this information to JAMA.This is an incidence of researcher bias entering into the scientific method. And your belief in this article takes faith.Steve Calvin August 30, 2005 In the Minneapolis Star-TribuneLast week's article on fetal pain in the Journal of the American Medical Association proves the desperation of the defenders of unrestricted abortion. The article reviews medical literature and concludes that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain prior to 30 weeks gestation.The authors were clearly motivated to write what I view as a medical fantasy to counter proposed federal legislation that would limit abortion in the second trimester. The legislation would require informing women considering abortion that fetuses beyond 20 weeks feel pain and would require anesthesia for the fetus.Twenty-five years of delivering babies and a specialization in high-risk obstetrics provide me some experience to refute the claim that fetuses feel no pain until 30 weeks. Many of the tiny babies that I deliver, some as small as 1 pound at 23 weeks, have required surgery during their difficult neonatal battle for life. All of them receive anesthesia.Before the 1970s, many newborns, both term and preterm, were operated on without anesthesia in the mistaken belief that they could not feel pain. They certainly couldn't tell anyone about their discomfort. With more sophisticated monitoring it became clear that blood pressure and pulse rose dramatically during the trauma of surgery. Subsequently, a subspecialty of pediatric anesthesia developed.Those who deny fetal pain claim that hormonal and withdrawal responses to invasive procedures are mere reflexes and are no evidence of pain. Recently, I performed an amniocentesis on a patient at 21 weeks gestation because of a possible infection. On ultrasound, the fetus pulled away from the needle when it grazed her arm. It is clear to me that this fetus felt discomfort, and that she would feel horrible pain if she were dismembered in the exercise of an unjust constitutional right.The medical literature duel over abortion has been quite one-sided since most of the medical hierarchy is ardently pro-abortion. There are, however, courageous exceptions.The most important medical study on abortion this year got absolutely no media coverage. A French study in the April 2005 British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology convincingly showed that a previous abortion increased the risk of subsequent delivery at 22 to 27 weeks by 70 percent. Premature birth has heavy personal and societal costs, yet the alarm over the increasing rate of prematurity ignores the abortion connection.The fight over requirements for informed consent prior to abortion continues because abortion defenders refuse to accept any restriction on this manufactured constitutional right to exercise prenatal lethal violence. Their blind orthodoxy requires denial of fetal pain and willful ignorance of the significant long-term consequences of abortion.Steve Calvin is a Minneapolis physician.
1	You posted an unfounded assertion, which I quoted, and asked for five examples of such statistical conflations which you suggest are commonplace. You produced an impressive list of sadly irrelevant links, which whilst constituting a response, do not address the question. This further emanation is similarly bereft of relevance to the point at issue.
1	I was unaware of specific instances because my daughters are 29 and 30 years old respectively and not in the fifth grade like the parent who reported this issue. But I wouldn't be so coy as to not provide evidence that these things are happening in other public school systems in other states as well as in mine. Here ya go, read it and weep you parents of young children.

1	Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that.  Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states.  And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.
1	Yes, brains in a vat, the Matrix, and Last Thursdayism are unprovable. That is why science has been so successful - it only deals with naturalistic explanations for naturalistic phenomena. An unconstrained supernatural force can provide an answer for anything (fossils in the ground, complexity in organisms, etc.) but will provide an explanation for nothing. Science is in the business of providing explanations - philosophy is down the hall and on your left.
0	But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?  Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with  philosophical pronouncements  that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond  atheistic philosophical pronouncements. 
0	You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?
0	Actually, I have a better idea. We're getting all out of sync with our replies and it's going to get messy - my fault, I introduced too much ground to cover in my OP. Pick a subtopic - say the interpretation of fossil evidence, or the plausibility of common ancestry between chimps and humans given their modern forms and lifestyles, and we'll focus on that. The other points we've raised and challenged, we can put on hold and refer back to later.
1	Because our laws say it is a right...
1	He doesn't. There's plenty of evidence for the existence of God in my experience. You just choose the interpret the evidence a different way--for some creation is evidence OF God, not against Him. God is no more easily disproven than He is proven, IMO.
1	Well nothing, other than the fact that I don't believe it to be true!  But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.  I don't see why not, it appears the most logical explanation to me.  You are right, it's not a nice thought. But then again little in life is. Why should this be any different?
1	Because Christianity has already proven to be a lie and completely absurd, all of the legislated morality on it is invalid.  Do you, ChristAscended, see a problem with relying on a unproven assertion for your debate? Where you relied on assuming falsely that evolution has been disproved, my example relies on Christanity already being proven to be false as well. Neither your or my underlying assumption is true. Therefore, you cannot create a meaningful or even valid discussion based on something that is merely conjecture, especially when it comes to ethics.
0	So it is a bad thing that children read about people and families that exisist and that they are likely to come across? What about King and King? That is a story of a prince falling in love with another prince. If King and king has an agenda then so does snow white, cinderella, Repunzel, and sleeping beauty. Ever read the real stories for yourself, not the cleaned up Disney versions, they are gruesome little tales that would give any child nightmares and make King and King look tame.
1	Because guns are the best method available on the market. Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid.Better locks? The best they'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you, their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they're on.Alarms? So somebody will know that you're in danger, what then? That won't get the police there any faster than dialing 911.Non-lethal weapons? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option. Brandishing a can of pepper spray won't cause an attacker to flee for their life, it won't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them, it won't stop a violent individual from across the room, and it sure as hell won't affect somebody that's doped up on narcotics. And stun guns are more useless than knives, because as I've said before, you need to get right up against your attacker to use them. You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them, do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you, not let them get right next to you.All of these non-lethal devices, they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you, is worth more than your own life. That belief is stupid and should be done away with. Ask any woman that's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do.

1	So is it safe to say you may be for pro-ignorance? With technology ANSWERS become clear.Everything cost money. Education cost money, therefore knowledge has a price tag. Do you now suggest people don't go to College because it too is yet another EXPENSE. Society should NOT be inventing equipment that advance our intelligence. Sonograms are great tool for understanding more to those women who have doubt. I don't know about you, but I'm all for empowerment with knowledge. Most people are "VISUAL" people and perhaps seeing the unborn may make the CHOICE clearer for the woman. I'm for educating those from ALL PERSPECTIVES. Most people would rather see physcial evidence that a sonogram may provide than the RHETORIC of SLOGANS and IDEALISTIC POINTS OF VIEW.I know your kind..."just trust me" is your motto.
0	You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.
0	All born children, and every woman had the right to be rid of them. Killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb (during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur, at least). They are not comparable.
1	The maintenance of the integrity of the code is not dependent on selection, but dependent on internal variables (feedback system) for maintaining functional integrity. Again, showing another form of optimality.In article 10:Fascinating research was conducted whereby a sundry of different unnatural amino acids with novel three and four base codons have been selectively incorporated (engineered) into proteins yielding viable organisms.An intriguing question arises from this research. It is easy to imagine these to arise through chance and selection (e.g. amino acids with photoaffinity) and then be incorporated into the standard code. Yet the code seems to remain stagnant. For billions of year after fixation, little evolution happened in the code. Why? Did it arrive at a global optimum in a pre-existing fitness landscape, with a pre-existing fitness function?Finally, Article 11:The article cites many of the optimal properties above and concludes:
1	That logic can be applied to weeds or trees. Anything that is non-sentient, or non-mental existant. Should we make gardening illegal too? The thing is, you have no base for calling it a human being or giving it the same rights as us. Human beings are, by nature, sentient. That is what makes us different from wildlife. When that only difference is separated, then it should not share the same rights as you or me. An accurate analogy would be someone who's brain was ripped out and was kept on life support. It would only be a body, no person inside of it. Same goes with an embryo. It simply cannot override the rights of its host.
1	And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....
1	Well, the easy answer is that a lizard didn't evolve an avian lung. There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung. However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.  So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.  However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.  But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.  Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say. To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself.

1	Population should decrease? Are you making another one of your anti-evolutionary statements? Populations are supposed to grow. However, the caucasian population is shrinking. You need to have 2.9 children in order to reproduce the population, but almost all of the European nations and the US arn't even producing that many. Our population is growing, but only because of hispanics.

1	Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either.

1	Thanks!  There's a petrified forest in Mississippi also. I don't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces, but I'll find out next trip.  I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?  Likely, the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen. Other inert gases could have done the same.

1	Yes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion.
1	The existence of a soul is a bit tough to test in a lab but is you pour clorox on a virus it stops moving and spreading, and evolving does it not? Of course killing it's host and burning the body would also be a good empirical test .  However if one has no soul then murder is just rearranging matter .  Why would that matter?
1	I think there is a difference in saying what you must have and saying what you can't have.  Ok, does this apply to only businesses? What if the advisory panel says  in order to maintain health for the state, every citizen is required to own a toothbrush .  A free society works by saying  you can't do this stuff but everything else is up to you guys . If you go around saying  you must do it this way  then you really aren't a free society but you have the government controlling instead.  It is just inconsistent.

1	Oh, and I found this from here:  http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.   It appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. And the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. The only one getting anything wrong here is you.
0	They should be discredited, and their hypocrisy should be exposed. Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry, supposedly in "defense" of "traditional marriage," when some of them are out sneaking around, cheating on their wives, and lying about it when confronted. The only reason this guy admitted the truth is because evidence surfaced about his visits to prostitutes. Meanwhile, has has tried to advance his political career at the expense of gay people. Some defender of marriage! This is a classic example of someone needing to get the log out of his own eye.
0	I think dropping trou for illicit gay sex has nothing to do with genes. It's a deliberate behavior.
1	You recognize there are two sides (at least) to this argument. To support the arguments, one needs supporting information resources.  On one hand, there is some video you found on the Internet.  What do you view as the opposing information resource?  Could it be the tens of thousands of peer reviewed articles and books over the past 150 years that support the theory and corroborate each of other, or are you thinking about another Google video?
1	Premise 1: God lives in another universe (Heaven) and therefore cannot be detected in this universe. (Definition of God)  Premise 2: If something exists, then it can be detected/sensed. (Definition of Existence)  Contrapositive of Premise 2: If something cannot be detected/sensed, then it does not exist.  Conclusion: God does not exist.  The reason that this doens't prove Atheism is that it cannot disprove the existence of, say, the Hindu gods, which are defined as beings in this world that can be seen. It just disproves theism.
1	I don;t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india, and don't really see it's relevance, since colonial india is gone. I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).
0	No, they just don't 'fear' in general, their fears are directed at something (madmen with guns ), and those that do find other ways to feel protected (usually in society rather than being a lone individual).
0	Then you are just throwing around words without knowing what they mean. Instead you give me a link to a page of pseudoscience. Are those the ones who lied to you?
0	fn 57 ammo that is sold in America is not Armour piercing. further more they make Armour piercing ammo for many many hand guns so pretty much any handgun given military ammo will pierce a vest. also any deer rifle will pierce a vest so are they going to ban those too? no, the gun is just being singled out i don't know why but it is.  also fn has sued any one calling there gun a cop killer.
0	Yeah, ok, keep up with your  Creationist  therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of  Evolution.   Keep your religion out of MY Government!
1	Yes, kind of reminds me of Abraham Lincoln's thought: "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."
1	Most of these ammendments were rushed in thier writing. They have all sorts of issues and problems. Most will be shot down in the courts with in the next year. Too Broad or cover more than one issue. Most will be found unconstitutional. They are just an obstacle, not the end of the war.

Note some of the shops do not have electricity. Most just have tools no more advanced than making horse shoes.
1	But it's not a "fact" unless you've defined what you mean by "person." If you define "person" as "the combination of a fertilization event," then all you have is a meaningless tautology.
1	Actually, creation explains nothing. Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change. One explanation is the theory of natural selection.
1	No. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.
1	I think you may have missed this part of the article.  It is the law, and our state's Constitutions. All we Americans ask is for everyone to Obey the Law! I think even you would have to agree with that statement.
0	Why is it that evolution cant be considered as a mythical tale?. A tale of how soup turned into a human being , and that has no evidence for all the major links for this story to work!....
1	The speculation was in regards to the precise evolutionary change that had taken place. If you read a little further down the same page:  So not only has the new functionality evolved once, its evolution has been reproduced in a different species under laboratory conditions.  Food for thought?
1	evidently not. You have been unable to present me with any scientific evidence that mutations can create the raw material for which natural selection (which also doesn't exist) would act.This renders your theory scientifically worthless and more along the lines of astrology or palm reading.
0	So it is claimed.
1	And if that was the accepted rule for Constitutional interpretation we would still have Jim Crow and the 14th Amendment would be as useful as the 3rd.  Total Fail on your part again Galileo . . .
1	Sure I agree with it. The thing is, you used to argue (not in these exact words of course) that decency on the part of the hospital wasn't required, all that gays needed to do was visit a lawyer and they'd be all set. I am asking you to clarify that position now to see if you still hold that opinion or if you've changed it, specificially in light of this event. Simple question, no gotcha waiting to pounce.
0	Do you want anyone to take you seriously?
1	And, as I have shown, that is the wrong thing to do. The only criteria for choosing a hypothesis is the data.
1	Well, I was just giving a different perspective from a witness who was also there, so obviously not everyone sees the events the same way. The thing is though, if they were booting people for being biased against the movie, or because they would object to it's message, it stands to reason they wouldn't have let anyone in PZ Myer's party in as well. And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe. It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie. Furthermore, if the producer deliberately started a discussion, then it only further stands to reason he didn't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie.
0	Oh my stars and garters. He actually admitted what "the real issue" is.

1	Well to be fair they do seem to have a problem distinguishing between armed and unarmed people. I recall an imigrant being shot 41 times with just some keys in his hand. Then there was the guy in the car shot while driving black.
0	She could, but not all do :) Despite the fact that it works, there are still unwanted pregnancies :) That doesn't change the fact that a pregnancy would not be pleasant to a woman who does not want to be pregnant :)Forcing pregnancy by law is a step toward fascism.
1	And gun control is not on the list.
1	There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.
0	But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against  choices  is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices.
0	It may not seem linked to the topic but something you said brought it up. I will clarify my link for it to this topic later. But, Why is there death?
1	I see. So you must be a female to know for a fact that this is false. Actually I'm not interested in that kind of science and I don't care. I haven't seen the papers but I suspect the book was written for mercenary reasons. What does that have to do with cosmology, physics, astrophysics, geology, molecular biology, genetics and on and on? Someone mentioned that you seem to mistrust science and it seems that you do.
1	What's ridiculous is your mis-reading of the argument. I'm both discussing individual pharmacists, and their refusal of service to individuals based on the drug the individual wants, which is already assumed to be dispensed at that pharmacy or chain.
1	On the contrary, there is no evidence to suggest that we have not evolved via common descent. Not in any living creature thus far examined, or any fossil thus far unearthed. We are obliged to seek out evolutionary mechanisms precisely because the fact that it has happened is beyond all doubt.
1	Well, by the strict defintion of the word "born", an abortion is considered a premature birth.
1	That "somebody" was a Jesuit priest, the idea met some initial resistance because of it's religious overtones. But the overwhelming evidence in favor of it carried the day. You should study some history too.
0	Ill be the first to agree with the saying  If you can...and have the place to...you will  But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things...It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life.  As for our irresponsable citizens...they are already armed.
0	But I'll bet that you don't know what any of them are.
1	And finally, my own letter to the editor, which was printed in this week's Sunday paper (08/28/2005).
0	The absolute truth is that for many of us evolution explains the diversity of life we see all around us better than "poof" ever did.
1	You are probably using the NIV version of the Bible. It is not the most accurate version because some of the meaning was lost in the translation. Here is the NASB version (much closer to the original meaning): 1 Chronicles 16:30 "Tremble before Him, all the earth; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved." "will"= future tense. The earth itself is moving (rotating, orbiting the sun, etc.), but it "will not be moved" by something else. 
1	No need to change the verbage:   ...individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments.   Like folks who migrated to northern latitudes and happened to have lighter skin(variation) were healthier and therefore produced more and healthier offspring. Over generations the lighter skinned came to dominate the group while becomming lighter still. Why is that so difficult? No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced. They just weren't as successful in the long run.
0	Translation: "Shut up, I'm right!"
0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).
0	But nonetheless fascinating!
0	How can the Bible be used as a source while you deny the truth of its claims? What parts of the Bible are true, and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true?I wonder how a modern court would view the testimony of 500 credible witnesses to a supernatural event?
0	someone needs to go over to IIDB and invite those kooks over here to debate me on this thread. There's currently an open thread over there with my name on it...seems they like obsessing over me....they're like a bunch of teeny boppers obsessing and salivating over a Backstreet Boy.
1	It doesn't. It says that the info can't be used by healthcare insurers to jack up rates. Nothing there about ending registration...unfortunately.
1	Yes, I would. The term is not simply just words. The definition of Civil Unions do not allow for the over 1,100 rights, liberties and protections granted to otherwise Legally Married couples. Civil Unions are non-transportable, meaning a civil union from one state cannot be recognized in other states. Now if you would like to call ALL legally recognized unions as Legal marriage, fine. That goes for heterosexuals as well. I just can't see that a heterosexual couple would ever want to enter into a "civil union" being as they would be denied spousal recognitions and transportability. I have als been asked before, in another forum, if I would be opposed to leaving the decission up to individual states. My answer is, yes. Due to the fact that legal marriages between heterosexual couples are granted federal recognition, benefits and interstate transportability which would be denied to Civil Unions if left up to individual states. Also we all know what would have happened if individual states were allowed to have determined women's right to vote, interracial marriage and de-segragation. None of those would have happened. Sometimes the general public just doesn't know what's best for their state's citizens. Much of the voting public is simply just too under-informed or misinformed. HR3313 (Protection of Marriage Act) and DOMA...MUST be repealed and steps to make all rights equal must be taken. The issue of gay marriage rights is indeed a civil rights issue. There is no way around it.
1	Actually, I reported the real results of a study. Regular church attendees are twice as likely to vote Republican...etc., the conclusion was, however, meant to be a joke. Most got it, you didn't.

1	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work. But gun ownership is still legal there.

Johnson: Is a flag burning speech, and where in the Constitution does it say so?emoticonXFrazzled I agree with the decision, which simply goes to prove that even a blind Antonin can find a peanut now and then.
1	But if there are too many dogs wandering around they do not change to be cats, or rabbits, or humans do they. They do not change so as to have eight legs and spider eyes do they. But yes development of the phenotype is a result of the genetic heritage interacting with the environment, but its not an intelligent process. If you starve a young organism to near the point of death and then rescue it with food it will not develop as if it had food when it needed it. It will not express its full genetic potential. The environment OFTEN changes the outcome of development by imposing limits on reaching the biotic potential provided in the genome.
1	Thats not the question we need to ask. We should be asking  Would I have done the same thing, given that situation?   If enough people answer yes, it is deemed to have been a reasonable course of action.  What I heard was that they had caught the guy, and had him pinned onto the floor of the train when one officer shot him at point blank range five times. Which doesn't sound reasonable to me.
1	Maybe both parties posting evidence to back up their claims would work?  Personally, I'm all for legalising weed. The same cannot be said for harder drugs (someone taking them once under social pressure, for example, can easily destroy someone?s life. I?d rather not have them that available). The pros of legalising weed (money saved on combating it, money gained form taxing it etc,), outweigh the costs, even if use does increase.  -Wez

0	First you yourself make a baseless comment saying  the amount of illegal abortions was not that many  then you suggest I need to disprove some baseless comment you previously made.  I'm afraid I do not. As I said I try to take a world view -- America is a small place compared to the entire world.  My comments are never reffering to America specifically unless I specify otherwise; I don't even live in America so it grates slighlty that I should have to make this point.

Nor does Paul anywhere claim these events didn't occur, although he had plenty of time and epistles to argue against them if he so chose.  Just another argument from silence.  p.s. Some of these are things are mentioned by Paul obliquely, like the Lord's Supper.  Next....
1	What's a "kind"? Of course, evolution is a slow process so only a fool would expect to see one "kind" of animal change into another "kind." But there are some quite good examples in the fossil record. The horse and the whale are two. And the dinosaur to bird line is getting better all the time.

1	I didn't mention evolution in this topic.  You did.

"Sorry, were going to force you to give birth, those men over there have decided".Thats as ridiculous as saying "There is no god to condones the slaughter of thousands of innocent life forms inside of the cut" (referring to disinfecting a cut).Pro-lifers have been dropped on their head too many times.

1	Well, next to my keyboard currently is a rather fine bar of Ecuadorian milk chocolate, 39% cocoa solids, make with organic, fairly traded cocoa and raw cane sugar, manufactured in Italy. I also still have the packet for a similar 35% cocoa solids Dominican bar, made in Germany. Have to say that on balance I prefer the Ecuadorian bar, much deeper flavour.  Hershey's is repulsive, and snickers is bland and greasy.  On topic, do US authorities seriously not make provision for burying the dead? UK local authorities are obliged to dispose appropriately of bodies if no-one else is able to make the arrangements.
1	Well, the people in Iraqu that we are killing are terrorists that just want to make chaos so they can come to power in the confution. We also went to war to remove Saadam from power. He killed 200,000 people. most of them were tortured to death. So yes it makes more sense to kill terrorists that are trying to kill as many people as possible than to kill little children that have not been born. Besides, babies are so cute :p
0	I thought it was on topic actually, if emotive. Well, it responds to the topic title, Ethmi re-refined the topic to just 'prove guns increase aggression' a few posts in.  Or are you saying that a child with a gun is just as likely to kill someone as a child without a gun?

Drink enough beer to get a buzz and smoke enough pot to get a buzz every day and the beer drinker will be worse off.But you and I both know that all this depends on the person.If you want to limit it to a beer a day then I can limit it to one toke a day.There you go...If weed is good enough, one or two tokes is all you need.You probably got WAY less tar than a cigarette and you didn't tax your liver with alcohol.

1	It seems to be the reason for crafting this new, individual right against the States. Since the original purpose of the Second Amendment doesn't appear to be needed, there is a new use that is protected.
1	No, the origin of the universe has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. Scientific disciplines have bounds. Biologists don't have to account for cosmology because it has nothing to do with the evolution of life on earth. However the universe came into being doesn't affect the theory of evolution. However life first arose has no bearing on the theory of evolution. The ultimate origin has nothing to do with the theory of evoution. I don't see where the definition you quoted does anything to make this point.......

1	And you've failed to explain exactly how Heller was a blank check endorsement on schemes such as gun rationing. Explain exactly how the judges ruling that the Second Amendment is truly an individual right, how DC's ban on handgun ownership and their trigger lock requirements being unconstitutional, would in any way suggest that one-gun-a-month laws pass constitutional muster.  Furthermore how to you reconcile the effects of gun rationing, with the fact that such laws make it absolutely impossible to catch gun traffickers in the act?  Give us some straight answers or leave the debate!

Or , is the silent majority being stirred from the insides of their very soul , to ask questions about their existence , knowing that their belief in the Big Bang theory , just cannot be ALL there is to human life ?

0	You need to do a little reading.  What you are describing is not what is generally referred to as  partial birth abortion  (which is a misnomer itself.)  If you are going to oppose something, at least learn what it is you are upset about.  Who calls themselves  iron courage  without any irony?
1	Sartre, you know little of history.Until relatively recently within the history of humankind, the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan--oh, how they loved their males, men were next to God in their eyes, a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church--ruled on the existence of infants within his clan. If he chose, this next to God male, the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance. If he chose not, the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or, perhaps, might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer. In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused, used as a sexual toy--hmmm, kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil. Interesting.

1	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.
1	Yes, but this is why I brought up the bible, because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality. I believe that you are right about Japanese culture, if you delved into it you would find there is not a genetic but cultural cause for their high suicide rates, but I believe that you would find the same thing with homosexuality.
1	Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?
0	That doesn't sound silly to me.
1	Actually you're wrong. Actually you're very, very wrong. The 5th Amendment, and all the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, only provide protections against government interference, not interference from your neighbors and people who don't have governmental jobs.But just for the sake of argument, if you want to argue how the man's rights were violated, how about we discuss the rights of the woman? Doesn't she have a right to not be raped? Doesn't she have a right to be secure in her own home against forced invasion?
1	Your logic is that if no one was there to witness it, it therefore did not happen. Under that logic, creation did not happen because no one was there to witness it, God does not count because we can't even prove it exists, much less hold it accountable for being there to witness it. The entire argument based around the witness via your argument is worthless. 
0	And how many murderers have got away with it because they lured their victim to their home? And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing. I'm glad I live in a civilised country where the aim is to avoid people getting killed.
0	Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty.
0	You know, considering how little ray knows about science, do you think we could write a creationist load of **** and take these XXXXXX for all their money?
1	If something is conceptual, that by definition means it was conceived by the human mind. That's what a concept is. I think that simply ends the discussion. Concepts are of human construction and thinking. Logical constructs are absolute only to the extent that they were designed that way.
1	It never will. The Wild West, incidently, had a markedly lower crime rate than we have today. Potential criminals knew they could be shot by just about any passerby who witnessed their crime.
0	Yes. Were I a logical gay man, I would accept the fact that I cannot marry a man due to the definition of marriage. I would accept that fact and continue to demand that all legally joined couples share the same benefits now given to married couples.
1	First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.
1	Actually it wasn't sitting somewhere since there was no "where" to "sit" and "always" and "eternity" have no meaning outside of time and no "time" existed prior to the "Big Bang", maybe.
1	Pregnancy isn't expensive at all unless you're conned into thinking it has to be. If it were, poor people couldn't have the kids they do. Medical costs can be paid for by others. It's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly. In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption, there is NO cost incurred to the mother.
1	You don't need an FFL to transfer an out of state  antique  firearm. I believe it is also OK for a minor to purchase and own an antique firearm. In addition, I believe the NFA doesn't apply to antique firearms. (Am I correct on that last one?)  So, zachvac can mail order a double barreled shotgun, saw the barrels short, and attach a pistol grip, legally.
1	And if you've ever read any of the speeches by PP's founder, you'd also know that every child should be a WHITE CHILD, too. She was an extreme racist and started PP as a means of stopping the increasing number of poor blacks. There was no altruism involved in PP's "birth".
1	Doesn't matter? If you're still on your straw man, whatever, if you are referring to an individual pharmacists not servicing based ON religion (Which is the case in many instances), then it's in black and white as against the law.  Regarding firing, if it's not in the press or if it's good/neutral press sure, some minority groups don't get equal treatment under the law, that's nothing new to America. Yet if it's national bad press that builds up, no, businesses distance themsleves from such nonsnese. They have on gay rights/health benefits, they will on drugs. Their business is to serve customers, not to promote religious mumbo jumbo. A few companies may indeed choose to not carry, who cares, that's your straw man. I'm talking about individual pharmacists in the large chains (wal mart, grocery stores, etc.) making a choice based on discrimination, refusal to service an individual.
1	That's still driving, and 15 1/2 is still 15. My original post is talking about 14 year olds, but I am now talking about 16 and 17 year olds.
1	Well let me tell you what Thomas Jefferson thinks of your pro gay sin folly:"Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least." - Thomas JeffersonAmendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and PunishmentsSodomy was outlawed in every state of the Union at one time. But now that homosexual sinners are coming out of their closets like the brazen hedonists that they are, we're regressing back to Sodom and Gomorrah values.Americans reject gay marriage. It's a perversion and an abomination.
1	I'd say there were a lot of stones going both ways.  Do you know the Rev. well enough to be able to make that claim, that he's a bigot? Or is it he represents the system?
1	In theory true but it gets convoluted when the discussion focuses on information that is freely offered by a citizen that seems innocuous but is actually incriminating under certain situations. EZ-Pass could be used to issue speeding tickets; the authorities know the minimum time it should take to travel between exits . . . You do it in a shorter time and you are issued a ticket. You have provided the authorities the evidence of your criminality and the means to prove it - but is that self-incrimination? 
1	I dont know how the negligence laws apply to First Aid in the states, but in Australia the situation is analogous.  You can, as a trained first aider, walk down the street. You see a man with obvious severe injuries, who is screaming out for help. Until you accept the responsibility of helping that man, you have absolutely no duty of care to him.  Similarly, until a mother accepts the responsibillity of having a child, she has absolutely no duty of care to it. She can even carry it to term and give it up for adoption.
0	No, its the truth. You ignore women in the scenario and see and use them as a mere tool for the birth of a fetus.
1	But the responsibility does not end with the woman who experiences the pregnancy. If it did, then men would not be required by law to pay child support.
0	Well Nozz. I hear Canada or Mexico are looking for a few good(did I say good?) men.  Kind of a dirty trick to pull on them though.;)
1	Yeah, that's something not many people think about. People always look at some perceived negative side of what if George Washington or Marting Luther King wasn't born, and don't look at that other end of the spectrum.
0	I dunno.  Do you think the Tooth Fairy will be happy with people drink-driving?  Any argument from a religious stand-point necessitates proving that said religion is true. Do that, and you'll get a lot of respect from a lot of people.
1	What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.
1	There isn't anything controversial about the articles claims, it has long been recognised that mammals evolved from reptile stock, who where descended from amphibians whose ancestors where fish.
1	That is not a law to respect, the civil right in the Second Amendment IS!  It is unconstitutional to require a license for a right freely given in the Constitution. - Murdoch vs. Pennsylvania plus about 8 more such rulings.  You just don't like the BOR brady, that is the Supreme Law of the Land.
0	You mean yours. Make up your mind as to whether or not there's a problem and what it is. State for the board.
1	Certainly not. Natural selection is but one of the mechanisms that cause evolution.
0	didn't Kevin Costner do a movie about this in 1995?
1	And if the data supports both theories equally well?
0	So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal. After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also.
1	Face it. Gun control is nonsensical. NOBODY has EVER managed to show any benifit from it. At best, it has no effect on crime and at worst it increases it.
1	Yes, I know it's a killing... I never said that it wasn't, I only said that LEGALLY it is not considered to be a crime (at this point).
1	I see you're right there. The trends here cannot be simply based on the number of searches because every trend would be climbing in that case as more and more people own computers.  I think the trend at any one point is calculated something like this -  (volume of trend search at given point / total search volume at given point )  Here another way to compare side by side -  http://www.google.com/trends?q=Chris...ate=all&amp;sort=0
1	This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.
0	Because they don't know any better. Besides, how many unwanted pregnancies have you had? How many abortions? Notice that most anti-choicers are men, which exposes the true hypocrisy in this dogma of thinking.
0	People should be responsible for their actions be they man or woman.......Why does the innocent unborn baby in the womb after to pay for the mistakes of its parents?
0	As much as it pains me I'm going to agree with Mathew here. If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want. If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.  Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government.
1	Again, I don't know what happenstance origins are, but ruling something out because it's unlikely doesn't work. I have made the poker analogy very often. If you are dealt in order, the 3 of spades, then the 5 of hearts, then the 9 of clubs, then the 4 of diamonds, then the 6 of hearts, would you decide immediately that it was not true? The odds are (1/52)*(1/51)*(1/50)*(1/49)*(1/48) = 1/311,875,200.This could be done for multiple games. The odds get slimmer and slimmer, but the difference is that something had to happen. No matter what cards you got, the odds of you getting the same card in that order would be this slim.
1	I think the point that can safely be made to all of you defenders of atheism and the Governments that practice it is that all of the people who have wrongly died at the hands of the corrupt Popes and the RCC throughout history in the name of Christ don't come close to the deaths caused by the Godless dictators who practiced genocide as shown by ChristAscended. That is the point he is making and that point stands.
0	You just don't get it. Americans are freemen. Your faith in governments over people is humorous... How does it fell to lick the bootheels of your government overlords..... Rights are inalienable to man. One man has NO right to intefere with another man. I should be able to do as I please as long as I do not intefere with others... How does your government feel about that?
0	A free country where gays aren't free to marry (legally)?  All of you against gay marriage realize that gays are married NOW, don't you? They get rings and everything and even adopt kids. It's all legal and happening right now. Scared? Is your marriage less valid or degraded? Is your life affected one bit?  .
1	Dating techniques can hardly be assumed to be accurate. There is no 100%accurate way to date fossils. It's all based on assumption.
0	Mach, your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues. I ask a question of this person, you reply not to them, but to me, and with ad hominem, and a 'just-so' statement.
1	Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.
1	You not differentiating between the beaver and the beaver dam, the bird and the bird's nest or the man and the man's truck. The dams, nests and truck do not occur naturally...they are constructed by the naturally occuring animals using materials that occur in nature (albeit we have to smelt the iron and vulcanize the rubber whilst the birds and beavers just stick stuff together).
1	This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.
0	Well what do you expect?! Everytime gun owners try and do anything to combat crime, you liberal sissies yell and scream about vigilantism and foam at the mouth as you talk about how we're taking the law into our own hands and that we'll be administering death sentences without trials for matters as trivial as jaywalking!You want us to combat crime, but you don't want us to actually do anything. Make up your mind already!
0	That would bother me, if the law did anything but regulate the cosmetics of a weapon. And force me to change magazines every ten rounds.  P.S. WHen is building your product to comply with the law 'circumventing the law?' Should we ban SUV's because when laws were put on to increase fuel mileage, the car manufactures made them get better gas mileage?
1	But doesn't the walking fish still exist? Here's a photo and an article of the Walking Fish, also known as the Snakehead. It's becoming a real nuisance in this Country since its natural habitat is in Asia.   http://www.city.arao.kumamoto.jp/sisi/images/
0	Whoooeeee!! That is almost certain to cost him (4) four votes.emoticon_xclown
0	But, now here's the thing, what about the peole with unwanted babies aren't good people. In my opinion, the vast majority unwanted babies aren't from good people.  A good woman having an unwanted baby is a completely diffeent case, but, as I said, it doesn't often occur that a good woman has an unwanted baby.
0	So you are truthful, but I am a liar. Just like you are clever, but I am stupid. You have no respect for me, WW; I've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone.
0	I personally can't imagine a time that it would be absolutly necessary to kill a child, though there is a lot out there that I can't imagine happening that does.
1	Good point.
0	I may just be being picky, but it bothers me when a reputable journal like NS can print  You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.  As I said, I may just be being nit-picky. Language apart, this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes.
1	YES, of course, they could not actually hunt, since that would be illegal, possibly a felony, whihc could lead to forfeiture of your rights.
1	Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick :) Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.
0	All things are possible with God. The flood was His judgement on the earth, He created the earth, and therefore He has the power to make what ever He wants to happen happen including make water come out of "nowhere." The Bible describes how water came from both above the earth and from below. My God is the God of the impossible!
1	There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.
0	But no one ever claimed that they were glued on the trees for any other reason that to show the protective coloration. Why is that a fraud? Wouldn't it be better that you actually learned the facts rather than allowing someone else to dupe you with this misinformation.
0	I think the gun lobby contributes to the problem- rather than encouraging gun owners to be responsible and to store their firearms safely they inflate people's fears about criminals. As a result, some gun owners feel they always need to have a loaded gun around even if it's endangering their children.  Merely hiding your guns is not enough. Children can find guns that are hidden. I remember staying at my grandfather's house during the summers as a child. After a little exploration, I found the rifle he kept down in the basement and the rifle and ammunition that was in one of the bedrooms on the ground floor. Guns need to be stored under lock and key to prevent children from accessing them. Trigger locks could help too.
0	So you're going to live with the Amish eh?
1	This has nothing to do with evolution.  This has nothing to do with evolution.  This has nothing to do with evolution.  This has nothing to do with evolution.  This has nothing to do with evolution.  This has nothing to do with evolution.
0	Yeah, ok, keep up with your  Creationist  therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of  Evolution.   Keep your religion out of MY Government!
1	I think it's fair to say that if there was no God, then there would be no gay people...
0	There are a lot of these people don't understand or don't make sense to them. I guess the things that don't are just stupid and made-up, huh?
1	To me,  Theistic evolutionists  is an extreme contradiction. I mean, either you have faith that the Bible is the true word of God or you don't. I don't see how you can pick and choose what you care to believe out of the Bible. How can one believe in the miracle of Jesus' birth and resurrection yet not believe that Adam and Eve were real people? I find it a contradiction to somehow believe that God is great enough to create the universe, yet He somehow needed billions of years to do so. If God is all-powerful, then His words should be all that's needed. To me, the world is proof that God is all-powerful. The beauty and complexity is just staggering. (if all the DNA in the human body was stretched out it would circle the moon 6,000 times!)  http://www.ba-education.demon.co.uk/...ience/dna.html
0	Actually, I had no intention of responding to WW. As I'm sure you can see by now, he doesn't actually respond to what's written, but rather just engages in lies and insults. He's not worth the effort to debunk; he's self-debunking.
1	Only those parts of the world that are ignorant and do not bother to do their research. Those who DO research recognize that even with the changes, there was still no ID being taught in our classrooms, and we still had stricter definitions of "science" and stricter curriculum than 38 other states.Personally, I don't CARE which way they go with this. They just need to pick one and stick with it. The changes DO NO effect curriculum at the classroom level, and DO NOT allow for any alternate theories (if you want to call "god dunnit" a theory) to be taught. The whole thing has just been an expensive peeing contest between 2 sets of XXXXXX that has drawn the attention of a bunch of other XXXXXX who fail to recognize that it means NOTHING. It is essentially a philosophical argument without meaning or merit. Kansas has some of the best schools in the nations. We are in the top 5. This IDIOCY never should have been allowed to pollute our educational system, and it CERTAINLY should not have been re-introduced 4 times. The stupidity is simply mind boggling.
1	Usually as examples of errors, do you have a specific example?From TO  Regarding Futuyma's use of the Haeckel embryo drawings in the 3rd edition of Evolutionary Biology, Wells writes (p. 109), "But it was Futuyma who mindlessly recycled Haeckel's embryos in several editions of his textbook, until a 'creationist' criticized him for it." However, an inspection of Futuyma's 1st and 2nd editions of Evolutionary Biology reveals that no such drawings were included in these editions. In the first edition, Haeckel's biogenetic law and the problems with it are discussed on page 153 in respectable fashion (this corresponds with page 303 in the second edition) -- and in fact the primary issue surrounding Haeckel in textbooks, which has always been to debunk Haeckel's "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" oversimplification, is in fact admirably discussed in all three editions.
0	Well, I DUNNO?!?! Did god do it!?!??!?!   Of course dinosaurs exist. There are fossils proved to be millions of years old, by real scientists. Why is it so hard for you to accept the way the universe was made? Why are you so afraid of logic?
1	no it is not. Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly. I'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable, adaptive variation.Here you go.that's not a controlled experiment. try again.How do you carbon-date a rock?you don't...you break open the "rock" and carbon date the soft, flexible parts that somehow survived for 100 million years without turning to stone. (It would also help if you broke the big bones open and looked for such tissue...something science evidently never has done either until Mary S. did it a couple years ago.Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - I say new, beneficial traits arise across a given population at the same time because the traits arise from within each creature. Likewise genes may be transferred from one species to another horizontally, without selection.“Scientists pick holes in Darwin moth theory” by Robert Matthews in the Sunday Telegraph (March, 1999)Nothing from the New York Times? I'll check this out though.I'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the debate, though. ID? EAM? YEC?anti-darwinian.SS: Show me one instance of a genetic mistake (random mutation/copying error) that that created a beneficial body part.What do you mean by 'part'? If you're asking for an example of a single mutation that created an arm or a leg where none existed before, then you're asking for evidence of something that the ToE in no way shape or form says is possible. ok....I'll save that.Sickle-cell is a pretty good example, though, if you're prepared to accept blood as a 'body part'. I'm not....besides, sickle cell adds nothing benefical in the way of phenotype. We've been over this here. Have anything else?Strictly speaking, accumulation of mutations alone isn't what creates a new species; so long as a species interbreeds well, well since you can't show me one case of speciation, with backup that the old and the new species can't interbreed and produce viable offspring, we'll just assume that it can't be done at all.SS: Show me one instance of a mutation that formed a new organ or limb.Not possible, and not predicted or required by the ToE either, so it's a strawman.cool, ok...we agree there. Do you think a mutation can create a partial organ or limb?...like say 1/100th of one -- and be selected for?Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick :) Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.those are not animals and it's not RMNS....it's simply a fluid, adaptive genome at work. If RMNS worked in the petri dish then it should work by way of controlled experiments on actual animals -- which ToE scientists refuse to do.SS:  show me set of skeletons that transition from ape to man by way of small modifications.  I can show you skeletons showing the transition from ape ancestors to man, if that's any use? yes, it is of use -- show me.SS: Explain to me why we don’t see humans or dogs or alligators with accidental wings forming. (If the possibility was there for random mutations to produce wings on reptiles or mammals in the past, then it should also be happening now.)  Oh dear; where do I even start?Ok, look, the ToE doesn't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere. It just doesn't.Ha! do you agree that the first winged animals came from non-winged animals or not? If so, what's the difference?
1	I think this is pointing out that an organism doesn't start as naked DNA, its within a cell that has split off from another organism (possibly developing inside it even) which is being exposed to triggers from the environment. So far this is fitting with your view of evolution.The bit where you seem to get confused is to then think what are the triggers acting on? Is the information that encodes the changes in the environment or within the genes - clearly if you put various organisms into an environment they do not all change the same way. The fish that get larger in the absence of predators are clearly going to react in the opposite way to the predators themselves.The key to the idea here is that they are triggers - things which then cause other things to create the effect we see. Genes are turned on, off or have the amount of expression altered by external effects, Bacteria have whole sets of genes that are generally switched off until the situation triggers them. Does this mean the bacteria have suddenly learned how to produce some essential amino acid, due to the innate property of an amino acid lacking environment, or that the environment has triggered a change in the expression of genes and causing something to happen that wasn't happening before?
0	So the bishops finally did it. They've been threatening to do that for years.  Well, I guess it's time to yank their tax-exempt status from them. We could definitely use the money to pay for health care and rebuilding our nation's Bush-destroyed infrastructure.
0	Liberalism is Dead; Long live the Constitution.
1	If you mean by this that we’re left shifted relative to the American spectrum then yes we are, and thank God for that! However we’re not a socialist country. We have a pseudo socialist government in at the moment, but they aren’t enforcing any true socialist policies. Blair realised that the only way to get re-elected repeatedly is to stay middle of the road...
0	Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? Much less can science offer "proof" of evolution by means of organ transplants. The idea is simple minded at best.since it seems to be important to you, why don't you offer "proof" that evolution doen't happen. Other creationists have already admitted that it does in this thread.
1	Based on their definitions. It has nothing to do with opinion. A circle cannot be a square.
1	Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped?
1	How do we know anything for sure? We can't be certain of the Earth's age in billions of years, but we can use carbon dating to figure out it's older then 55,000 years, which refutes creationism.
0	Yep - that's someting that many "pro-lifers" also never take into account.
1	Oh yes, of course. But that's assuming that the unfit populations actually survive long enough to breed. On the average, fit populations of a specie breed more than unfit populations of the same specie.
1	Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.
1	I think that what you two are doing is simply trading evidences. Saying someone is 'wrong' and directing them to a atheist web-site is not proof. You should merely be saying, 'here is an alternative argument'  I say this because I can access a number of science posts that state the exact opposite of what you say, and show that they can find evidence for a flood.
0	I think you are right.  One of my favorite Sidney Harris cartoons was two scientists coming out of a conference presentation, and one, absolutely thrilled, says to the other,  What a wonderful talk - everything we know is wrong! 
1	Well let's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages, suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever, Democrats lost more seats in Congress, the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office, a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate, evangelicals in the country were energized, the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50%, and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it's up in the air again.The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election.
0	What I am trying to point out is that it seemed like you jumped from the term "punish" to accusing me of not believing that God would take an aborted child to Heaven. It didn't seem like a logical jump. I know what you meant, but I didn't see the connection.
1	I think you can forget about God the super  engineer  on this one: your final question contains a necessary and sufficient condition to explain the case.
1	Now you're claiming that a gun is a precision machine. Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as "assault weapons" are "inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip". Which is it?
1	Really no more amazing how science can cure some diseases, smash the atom, create nuclear explosions, yet screw up many other things that it attempts to do, often at great expense to the general public. Global warming hysteria comes to mind.
0	I'd be willing to give it a shot. Except, you cannot bring up  right to life  but can use God all you want.
1	Actually, 2 viruses and a bacteria have been constructed by building the genome from nucleic acids.
1	Because evolution is a scientific theory, and has evidence for it. Creationism is religion. ID is bad science, and bad theology.. and there is no evidence for. If you look at the people who push it, and the place where their funding is coming from, you can see it is a religious front for far right CHristians.  Many Chrisitans do not have a problem with evolution. They are what are known as 'theistic Evolutionists', who feel that God directs the course of evolution. The intelligent ones of those realise that is a religious belief, not something that can be proven, hence it is an object of faith.  Evolution can be demonstrated in the lab. It makes predictions that can be tested. And, with 150 years of testing, it has not been able to be falsified.
1	I offered a defintion that non-material is not made of material. He was entirely unsatisfied by this; assuming this adds to his belief that it doesn't existHoweverMaterialThe substance or substances out of which a thing is or can be made.http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=materialSo, in fact the defintion for material is that it is made of materialSo therefore, according to Mach, because that definition is of itself, it can't exist.Of course he could say it's atoms etc., but that's what material makes up, not what makes up material
1	And this is evidence of creation... how? Please provide an explanation and a reference for how this is evidence of creation. Thank you! :-)
0	**Duh!! If someone slipped LSD into water, would you "just ignore [it]and go on working as before"? What if you slipped and broke your leg, would you "just ignore it and ..."?Nobody is claiming that biosystems are utterly spiritual and ethereal, for cripe's sake! Get real.
0	Well since you claim they are I simply don't believe you. This coming from the one who can't use much else than dishonest, biased gun grabber groups. I'd add you are a waste of time. I pay as much attention to your demands as I do to knat farts. In fact I'll make it a point to include them.To sum up your own biased gun grabber group isn't sure exactly where the problem is. Yet even they admit to an enforcement problem. The ATF says its straw purchasers. Not gun owners. Yet you insist its honest people not locking guns up. So far your evidence is scanty to non existant at best. You fail to acknowledge the fault of the criminal element in any way. In short eliminate the criminal from the scene and one could stack guns on the kitchen table safely. Its totally the fault of gun owners for failure to secure. You consistantly fail to acknowledge prior restraint being unconstitutional. It has been demonstrated that your storage idea has led to erosion of civil rights in other countries. Not to mention the very real possiblity of it happening here if your scam is followed. From the gunners seat its nitwits exactly like you in legislature that are the real problem. Now run for the bunker to evade the toxic environment. Your storage scam is shot full of holes.
0	I dont think I have heard a more pathtic excuse for a long time.All but a few of my colleagues could get into work during the very worst of the weather..why? because they didnt get paid otherwise.There needs only be a tiny amount of snow for UK teachers to stay away in droves...what a joke!Strangely enough when I went to school both the pupils and the teachers seem to manage to get to school in the snow.
0	Pretty close to what we are doing.  It is going to be outdoors, in my boss's backyard (nice area). It will be small, family, friends, 40 people tops. We will have some kind of food, haven't figured that yet. Got a really small budget. We plan on the vows, and rings and our parents doing something.  Lucky for us, we have great friends who want to plan it for us. But some details I feel we should decide.
1	No.It's not going over my head.I am pointing out something that is a more apt analogy.You just don't like it, cause your analogy doesn't involve somebody being refused service, so you prefer your inaccurate analogy over mine which is more apt.Me giving a better analogy is not something "going over my head"... emoticonXDonno
1	Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.
1	Wind goes north, south, east, and west, and it's always blowing somewhere, how does this relate to any kind of a scientific understanding of wind?  Record the conversation of any two Joe Sixpacks in a coffee shop as they talk about the weather and you have about the same level of science involved.
1	The  study  fails to do this. It offers a philosophical  proof  only, as the scientific method is not used in any way in the  study .
1	That is, not scientifically speaking.Of course, for abiogenesis claims, I keep this site handy. In particular, I would like to point out the second caption:"Figure 2. Original cellular genesis in retracement taped by Mr. Randall Grubbs. A large chunk of thermal protein (1000x) is contacted by warm 1.0% sodium chloride solution. On cooling, protocells stream forth in less than two minutes."
1	Good point. Touche.  Though lots of folks have not had abortions. Certainly most men have not.  I was just growing tired of a certain little poster's uninformed opinions of sexual activity. My post was intended to be a little playful. If it missed the mark, mea culpa.
1	Then you are sortsighted indeed.The shooting sports are a great way to channel aggression. Sporting clays, trap, skeet, cowboy action shooting, steel matches etc. Reactionary targets, loud noise what better way to channel aggression into a non-lethal activity.
1	So you solely have a problem with the theory of evolution, but anything in science that doesn't involve this theory seems sound to you. Correct?2 questions:If you trust the scientific method in the rest of science, and you feel the processes are sound, how do you account for the overwhelming acceptance of evolution? I mean, are the scientists whose field may involve evolution unique in their lack of integrity and are singularly foolish in endorsing evolution by natural selection? If the "evolutionists" are shills (for whom I am not clear), why is it the other scientists are trustworthy. Do the evolutionary sciences select for a certain type of person.Does your religious belief have any influence on your lack of acceptance of evolution.
0	Again, if it were only that simple.I don't have the "obligation to respect the choices" of those who infringe upon the rights of another. Rapists make a "choice." Murderers make a choice, molesters make a choice... Are you "obligated to respect their choices," Chester?Maybe in the sense that they are free to make "choices." You are.On that we will agree. But I expect we don't always agree on what the consequences should be for some of the choices people make.
1	And Atilla's army of as many as 1/2 million men was beaten and forced into retreat by the Romans and Visigoths in 451AD. A year later, he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside...but NOT Rome itself.He died a year later in 453AD.
1	Oh, so now you admit that you realize that the book isn't an exhaustive review of his entire belief system. Earlier you wanted to use lack of information against him...
1	Advocate of  choice?  What is  choice?  As I have stated many times on these threads,  Choice without reference to the object of choice is morally empty.  Abe Lincoln (paraphrased).  But do you not tell that child of rape that her worth hinges on how she came about? Do you not tell her that you would have consented to her existence being wiped out at any time? Do you not imply that anyone is in peril if we begin to assess their nature of creation, their standing in life, their physical characteristics, etc.?  I was not aware of that.
0	Well said, SP.
0	Again show me something other than an opinion. Describe how the avian lung could have evolved over time. Other than IT did it.
1	It depends, now, doesn't it.  What are you looking to do with it. It is a great set of stories to derive moral principles out of, if you look at it in the proper light (THe key is stories). From a historical point of view, it gives insight into the culture and concepts of an early people.  Like anything, it is what you make of it.
0	Bush has flip flopped just as much as Kerry. As for records, there is next to nothing showing that Bush actually showed up and did anything for the Guard.
0	I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.
1	According to a report published last year, the average waiting time for a hip replacement in the UK would be about 10 months. This average of course conceals large county and metropolitan variations (from one National Health Service Trust to another). A lot depends on where you live.  At least you'd get the operation for free in this country.
1	well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.
1	First, the universe is currently though to be between 13.5 and 14 billion years old.  Second, what is this "gap" you're talking about?
1	But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions. Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services.
1	Hmmm. Sounds like Iran.  Marriage is a idea that has been changed. Several times over to say the least. Seems you're relying on tradition.
1	And therefore a transitional by definition.
0	Government does not work; that's why it is important to minimise it.
1	Is the bible our constitution?
1	Well, I suppose that the reply it took me almost 5 minutes to type, a couple more to check and a couple to correct will not suffice now.
1	And why do you say that in ancient times that atheists were people who believed in 'God(s), but didn't belive in intervention) (a.k.a Deists).  Why do you think that people who didn't believe in god exist?
0	The US is 3 trillion dollars in debt, abortion is not clear cut (just visit a debate), and you appear to be stereotyping democrats. Also, you may need to read the first ammendment again. For your answer to work, people would have to agree with you first, then they would understand (and agree with) you.
1	I shoulda worked for this guy when I had the chance. He goes on to say that Bush was the most fiscally irresponsible president we have had...but Obama is threatening that title. This is something I have repeatedly said!
0	Thanks for clearing that up. Studies already show that younger Americans are more supportive of gays and lesbians, even when it comes to marriage. Actually, as foundit has pointed out, a majority of Americans already favor gays serving openly in the military. President Bush speaks so much about  the will of the people , but ignores them when it comes to the military policy towards gays. Change will happen, I just wish it were sooner, rather than later.
1	Actually I believe life begins at conception, that that life matters and abortion ends that life.  I also believe mama comes first and until we can seriously address the issues faced by pregnant women rather than demonizing them that they will abort whether it's legal or not.  I also believe that there are times when abortion is appropriate and necessary.
1	So what. Congress can pass any law it wants. Doesn't mean it will stand up in court.The first portion, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State," is a qualifier to what follows "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." It seems pretty clear to me. But I'm not one of the Justices. This decision has been made, although I don't like it or agree with it. I don't see where today's hobbyist meets the intent - most especially in the well-regulated part. But there comes a point where what the dead guys thought just doesn't matter that much. It is 200+ years later. They left us with the ability to adjust with time and we've done that. They recognized their own shortcomings which might have the the wisest thing they did. The current interpretation is clear. We look at the last portion of the statement only. I don't think that, as I said before, a little common sense, is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way.After all, I could easily argue (if I was totally stupid) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon. We both know that isn't going to fly. Just where does the armament argument end. With a cannon? Or with a Nuc. Let's face it. They said arms and they meant arms. Not guns. They'd probably let me have the cannon. The founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we'd have available today or what they'd be used for. That's why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended. Since we will always draw the line someplace, why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me.
1	He's not talking about the fossil Coelacanth, he's talking about the modern version of it. And you can assert all you want, without evidence, they're just that, assertions.
0	Winston Smith, there is already a thread on this topic.  Phelps and Company Nailed by Jury  And I believe they should ban religious speech the defame gays or ban religion all together as a public nuisance and protect the public from its drug like effects. I understand, however, that to restrict others freedom of speech of one group today, might mean that my freedom of speech could be restricted tomorrow.  They have the right to free speech even free speech, I or anyone else diagrees with. This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech. With freedom comes responsiblity. The law suit for pain and suffering, I think is just.  Oh so many law suits to plan. Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity. This case now sets Precedent, that if I find religious speech hurtfull, or the actions of religious groups trying to fight gay people, marriage, or gay rights, I could sue for pain and suffering.  God bless Fred Phelps for giving fundies and religion a black eye. Fred Phelps is the one of the best things ever that could happen for gay rights. GO FRED.
1	No, our Constitution doesn't really  forbid  it, what it does forbid is the government from forming a  state  religion. This has been interpreted to the benefit of all, to also mean that our laws cannot represent one specific religious belief system.  Granted, I do agree that a religious argument in terms of law is like comparring apples to a chair.
1	And as a result of his Bible studies he rejected the Trinity.
1	And pro- choice  doesn't distort? That alone shows an unreasonable look on the issue.  I agree that many are uneducated about the subject (which helps the pro-choicers I might add) and I think many that get an abortion are not educated about whether or not it is morally ok to do. Many have just grown up with it and assumed it to be ok (which neither side of the issue should support...there is nothing wrong with education on an issue).
1	So you must be against Medicare and Medicaid. I assume you would also be against nationalized healthcare.   The government, rather the supreme court dictators, became involved in the woman's body in 1973. You must be against roe v. wade.
1	Lacking substance as usual.... Whether Jefferson said it or not is not the issue. The topic of this thread is "15 myths about gun control" But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual...Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control" 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are "just statistics."4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should "put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a "state" militia.14. These phrases: "right of the people peaceably to assemble," "right of the people to be secure in their homes," "enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people," and "The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people" all refer to individuals, but "the right of the people to keep and bear arm" refers to the state.15. "The Constitution is strong and will never change." But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't "military weapons", but private citizens shouldn't have "assault rifles", because they are military weapons.18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.19. The NRA's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign is responsible social activity.20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is "an accident waiting to happen" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are "preying on their fears."23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a "weapon of mass destruction" or an "assault weapon."27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do "civilians" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.33. We should ban "Saturday Night Specials" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.37. "Assault weapons" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to "keep guns out of the wrong hands." Guess what? You have the wrong hands
1	If we were knowingly executing innocent people, it would be one thing. But the people we execute have been found guilty in a court of law, and are given the opportunity of 8 (i think it is 8) appeals. If after all of this an innocent person slips through the cracks and is executed, so be it. It is tragic, but overall I think the system works well the way it is. I think the deterent benefit of capitol punishment is far too valuable to throw away for rare instances of innocents being executed. Does anyone have any reliable information about how many people have been executed and were later found to be not guilty? I have never found any figures that I would consider to be reliable.

0	In my opinion, any man who walks away from his child because he doesnt want the responsibility he helped to create, is not a real man in my book. I just simply feel like if I got a woman pregnant, unless she is in eminant danger from the pregnancy, that I should have just as much of a legal right as she does pertaining to an abortion. I personally would love to have some kids, so i would never walk away from my child.
0	By the way, that video, among others is obviously satire on literal creationists. Edward Current has been running around making satirical videos on creationists and theists. The funny thing is, you can't figure out it's satire. What is even funnier is that you appear to think that the arguments Edward Current gives are actually good and prove that atheists are deluded. He uses so many fallacies including circular reasoning and you can't seem to notice that those methods of argumentation are extremely poor. But then again, you seem to think that Co2 is the primary input gas for ATP production rather then O2....I'm still waiting for your equations proving that ATP production is massively higher with Co2 rather then O2.
0	Actually, creationists haven't studied this further. That would imply actually condisering the evidence. The creationist stories you will find won't be "study" but just ad hoc stories with no more foundation in fact than the Bible myths themselves.

1	I did not say that violent crime  rarely  occurs, merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks. I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals.
1	So Goddidit?  I see you still haven't gotten back to the thread where 'intelligent design' was shown to be nothing more then  we ignorant, therefore Goddidit.  Nor did you explain away how ID is any different then Animism.  If you took someone who lived in the jungle all his life, took some food, put it in a microwave and then served to him and asked him how the food got hot, what would you expect him to say?  Magic most likely as that has been the outcome of similar situations in the past. What we know to be a simple electromagnetic device is magic to him.  Just because we do not know does not mean God was responsible. If you think like that, then 10,000 years of human cognitive advancement has skipped you.

1	Peppered moths simply emerged from the egg according to background...their  evolution  had nothing to do with random mutations or natural selection. Butterflies exhibit the same ability...they can emerge with specific wing variations/markings according to predators and other environmental influences. There is no selection.  http://ourfcs.friendscentral.org/mot...yphenism1.html (see bottom picture)  http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm  The authors note that what's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time  yea...no kidding.

0	That's your argument?  Just surrender your guns now, you can still get them illegally later on?  That's the dumbest argument I've heard yet since Galileo's argument of  Just go ahead and register your guns now, if the police want them they'll confiscate them whether they're registered or not.   Also, in this sentence you just admitted that gun bans are useless. You said that people could easily acquire bans after they were banned. So you're admitting what Great Britain did was a useless tactic that can't have any beneficial results.
0	Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time.
1	Some cancers are due to the environment, many are not. Nearly all are due to either inheriting a set of predisposing genes or to chemical interference with normal genes, or to mutangenic effects of radiation and chemicals. The degree to which man made mutagens causes cancer is not entirely clear except in special cases like vinyl chloride, benzene, and tobacco smoke among others. Environmental controls can only provide some degree of prevention, they cannot cure cancer after its established. Mostly thats done by immune system action - we all get cancer rather often in fact, but it gets killed off before it becomes a problem. That system is of course not perfect and people do often develop serious problems with cancer. The simplest public health improvement would be to eliminate the habit of smoking cigarettes - speaking of billions and billions of dollars! {and I am not even taking heart disease and possibly AZD into account}. By the way we appear to have a good handle on stopping cervical cancer cold in its tracks via vaccination against the relevant viruses.
0	You are missing the point of my using the quote. It is not an excuse for any kind of behavior. It is me, telling you, and anyone else who cares to meddle in my private affairs that they are not welcome there and I will not be taking into consideration for one second what any of you think.
1	Government employees are also expected to be fingerprinted but I don't think any reasonable person would think that is treating them like criminals. In the early period of America most gun owners were required to be government employees by law- they were required to enroll in the militia and received pay for doing so.
0	Heh. On the one hand, science articles written for the general public are generally useless and often outright wrong. On the other hand, I don't have an advanced degree in bio-chem or the like, so the summary didn't really tell me much. Hrumph. :)

1	Most bats have eyes. Aside from that, the answer to your question is, once again, a big "Duhr...". Echolocation is superior to vision because it works no matter how much light exists. Optical vision only functions if there's light, and low and behold, most bats feed and live in darkness.

No. He is the one who will take care of the woman but obviously if he wants the child after birth then he doesnt' mind taking care of anyone. He is not the one who is going to go through of all the changes that she is and he is not the one who will be scarred for life.  2. How do we know that man is somebody worth gestating for and won't leave the woman after it is born? We don't, so I am not going to gestate for someone who very well may up and leave after its' born.  3. What if the woman didn't want sex the night of conception and he didn't necessarily pressure her.. but nag her and she decided to give in to shut him up? I know that sound ridiculous to some of you but what if?
0	This isn't a debate, its an attempt to flood you with so much garbage you don't have time to refute all of it at once, though a cursory inspection of any of his claims will reveal their inadequacies.
1	No, it doesn't. The big picture of evolution is that it is the observed change in the heritable characteristics in populations of organims over generations. In cases where populations become fragmented, the separate (reproductively isolated) segments of the population will accumulate genetic differences. The longer they are separated, the more likely it will be that they will be unable to interbreed if united. This is observed. The result is the establishment of separate species.
1	How about for starters that the letter J never existed in the cultures He was named in?  Yahshua being the more accurate pronunciation of His name. In Greek, it was Iesous which was further corrupted in Latin to Iesus...finally, someone later dropped in the J for Jesus.
1	Well obviously you didn't shoot yourself or somebody else.
0	Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.
1	So individual cells contract to move cytoplasm around and to transport oxygen within itself?
1	Yes, I can. In our formal debate, you finished up your first post like this;
0	I believe in what I have no evidence to support. That is faith. I do not believe in evolution. The evidence is overwhelming for the educated. As for your "stumbling blocks," they are founded in ignorance. Why don't you educate yourself? You make creationism look foolish.By the way, what is the problem with Archaeopteryx? I'm sure that you have educated yourself to address the list of features that I gave. I just can't believe that you would speak to the issue and not understand the implications of all of those points that I listed. Were you just a parrot?It seems that you lack the ganas to even say that you don't know. An example of "creation science" at its best!
1	And what would make them separate species? How about wolves and dogs, separate species? How about Great Danes and Chihuahuas? They cannot interbreed under any circumstances (even artificially - the fetus isn't viable).
1	Creationists need to latch on to the intellectual integrity of science. They know that if they can represent their claims as  scientific , many people who otherwise would ignore them will pay attention to their incredible claims.  To put it crudely, the creationists seek a ride on the science bandwagon.
1	Well either the Pottenger cat/pig/mouse thing is either the truth or they made the whole thing up. I think we are seeing a mirror of this experiment in society today...please notice how diseases are striking people at younger and younger ages....it's not going to get any better, either because people are not taught the reality about nutrition -- and that what they eat not only effects them, but their offspring as well.
1	And from here: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIC1aRandom.shtml
0	BS. Where is the raw data... The link you show is from www.gunowners.org over there and does not give links to the raw data so it is probably skewed to make themselves look better.  Your own words condemn you
1	Well the government track record in health care isn't too good. Medicare is broke and busted by their own accounts. So if they can't run that correctly by what stretch of the imagination do you come up with them being able to manage the whole healthcare industry? Medicaid is broke. The VA healthcare system is a shambles. You would think they would get them up and running smoothly before trying to sell us the snake oil of their healthcare. Then there is the big problem of rationing. No matter what lies are told, health care is rationed in socialized medicine.
0	You are missing the point. Evolutionists say that certain animals in a population are GENETICALLY superior than others....and these genetic superiors are more successful breeders. Do you understand this concept? So when you say that more humans are born than reproduce, that's not particularly important because I submit those who go on to reproduce do so mostly because of choice or circumstance -- not because of their GENES. How can you possibly refute this?
1	So then you will agree that evolution is useless in getting at possible answers on what really matters, how we got here? If you concede that then I'm happy to end this discussion. I recall, however, visiting the Smithsonian and seeing a detailed description of how amino acids combined to form the building blocks of life. Evolutionary theory does address origins and its explanations are unsuppported by evidence.  politicalref.com
0	That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance. I certainly think it was excessive. I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic.
0	But you have challenged science with your beliefs. You argue against science with your beliefs, based on mythology with no evidential support. You argue against real science so that you can cling to your fairy tales.
0	The problem you are left with lyteboy, is that I didn't try to do that at all. See?
0	If the evidence is so weak that you have to take classes on the subject in order to be able to "see" the connection, that's not very good evidence.
1	If you beleive in evolution, then you are not a true Christian. God told us how he created us right in the bible. Evolution tells the exact opposite of that, so if you accept it, you deny God.
1	So what? A lot of guns we own today come from various countries.And don't forget, a lot of the early gun makers in America were German. They gave us the first ever American rifles, capable of killing a redcoat out to 300 yards; three times the effective distance of the Brown Bess musket.
0	What possible concern is any of that to you?  Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon.
1	I hate to break this to you but this is racked with illogic.  Well, ok it's  logical  but the premises rely on things that are pure assumptions.  Just because something can't be detected doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  And, of course, if god is god the way we think about it, then God is everywhere, including in this universe. He is the universe (but we can't detect him). Does he exist now or not?
0	Ok, what about the black baby in the womb??
0	And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?
1	The subject matter would be life forms. The units would depend on which particular aspect you were studyingFor instance to the question 'what units of measurement would you use for the effect of evolution?I would say genetic changes that have patterns.ID would have that and more.
0	You're not one of those people who doesn't consider Catholics christians are you?
0	No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and  a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious.
0	What?? You mean their society didn't implode due to giving civil unions to all, under the weight of legal quagmire as some who have argued against this from the gay pride movement have asserted?? The sky didn't fall? Imagine that. :)
1	So we can't base our definition of  kind  on mere appearances?  I mean if we are going to put things into categories and call the category  kind , we should do this by common appearances. A penguin is in the same kind as a hummingbird, but is a lobster in the same kind as an oyster? Obviously a lobster and a shrimp would be in the same kind, but could a dolphin and a manatee be in the same kind? Did they evolve from a common ancestor kind?  And since apes look and act so much like humans, didn't they just evolve from humans? By all appearances, they we must all be in the same kind.
0	You are just plain pathetic in your pursuit of dishonest argument on behalf of the health insurance industry.They were not insured, they could not get in for treatment without insurance, both were preventable deaths, costs were unbelievable, and you know it.You couldn't care less about that mother and unborn child. You don't care about any unborn children.You worship the Almighty Dollar. That's all.You are politically finished in this country and you know it. Everyone is sick and tired of the lies and greed of your ilk. Your Demon Ship is sinking fast and you know it.
1	Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.  And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.
0	PH, is this wher you got your rabid  UN hates guns  rhetoric?  Lets look at what is being attacked here:
0	Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional.
1	Right. Please, reread your argument. Not to mention what Woodward actually said about Piltdown man. www.talkorigins.org
1	yes, and we could regress infinitely here. i'd say well they developed from basic nervous cells near the skin surface, and youd say  well where did the nerve cells come from  etc etc. ulimately, we'd be back to square one: either they evolved from simple dna-type acid chains, or poof god did it. the existence of eyes actually doesnt make a great case for either argument
0	And there is that disingenuousness on display! The dissenting Justices would never propose the use of a alternate, subjectively interpreted standard of scrutiny to be applied for any other right deemed "individual" expressly secured by a provision of the Bill of Rights (Stevens especially and even for rights NOT enumerated). The dissents refuse to consider the incongruousness of saying that, "based on our precedent and today’s opinions, to which . . . the entire Court subscribes" the 2nd Amendment, "protects an “individual” right—i.e., one that is separately possessed, and may be separately enforced" and then argue that, "When each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia."Say what????The leftist dissenters, while acknowledging the Court's history of unwavering "individual right" conclusions, revert to their old statist (but invalid) theories when explaining their unconstitutional, philosophically bankrupt positions.
1	Religious institutions are now able to define marriage as they wish. For example, they need not recognize divorce or inter-faith couples, or even couples deemed to be incompatible by the religious official for any reason. The same is true of there not being a requirement to marry same-sex couples. Polygamy is a different topic, because it is not just unrecognized legally, polygamy is illegal.  Couples who married at city hall, before a JP, because they are non-religious, and it was important to them to not have a religious ceremony, will no longer be able to use the term.  Why is there a desire to get rid of state-recognized marriage now, at the possible prospect of the state recognizing a same-sex couple in marriage?
1	You make an excellent point, Shooter. While I don't feel the "voter referendum" idea should be abolished completely, there should be limits as to what should and should not ever be put to a simple majority vote, which I feel is like a state being able to cancel out the republican (little "r") concept upon which our country is wisely based and revert to mob rule.Whatever the majority of a state's populace's preferences or prejudices, they should NOT be allowed to put up for majority vote issues that openly contradict that state's constitution, as interpreted by those they elected in the first place. (I'm speaking California here. I know in some states their Supreme Court judges are appointed--nevertheless, those that appoint them are elected.)If they want to vote in new judges, fine. New legislature, fine. But once they've voted them in, I don't feel they should be able to go around, gather a few hundred thou signatures, put on the ballot an initiative to negate the rulings, and spend scads of money (mostly from out of state, yet!) to go "booga booga" to lie to, mislead and frighten people to overrule the decisions of the people whose legal knowlege and wisdom they voted to abide by in the first place.This voter initiative thing, at least in my state, is seriously flawed.

1	See, for example, the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh. The gods decide to destroy the world in a deluge. One of them  goes rogue  and warns a man named Utnapishtim. He is advised to build a great boat, and to bring every living thing aboard, which he prudently does. He and his wife and the animals ride out the ferocious storm for seven days and seven nights. Utnapishtim finds that when the rains have stopped, land is nowhere to be found. He releases several birds to no avail, but finally a raven finds dry land. Meanwhile, the god who had originally proposed destroying the world now relents and blesses Utnapishtim and his wife with immortality.  The written version of this story predates the written Judaic tale of Noah. Which isn't to say that the Israelites borrowed the tale consciously or deliberately. Nor even, necessarily, that they  borrowed  it at all: various elements of the tale can be found in sacred stories throughout the Fertile Crescent, and all of them originally appeared in oral traditions, so it's exceedingly difficult to determine which came  first  or to sort out the subsequent lineages. But that the stories are closely connected is clear. And when one considers the historical connections between the Israelites and the Babylonians, it becomes even clearer.
1	I see, when you say "I'm not an expert" do you mean you aren't a climate scientist or do you mean you don't have the scientific knowledge to discuss this?
1	I doubt it. They know the TROOTH and will refuse to be confused by facts.  How about the Herto skulls? Herto skulls (Homo sapiens idaltu)  So it seems that the gap between 500,000 years and 100,000 years is being filled. Now we have Homo erectus, H. ergaster, H. antecessor, Homo heidelbergensis (archaic H. sapiens), H. ??? (Gawis, Afar, Ethiopia), H. sapiens idaltu, H. sapiens sapiens.  This seems to lend even more support to the Out of Africa II hypothesis. H. heidelbergensis has been found in Africa, Spain, and Europe and is believed to be ancestral to H. neanderthalensis. Late H. heidelbergensis are very much like early Neandertal fossils. But H. heidelbergensis in Africa seems to have led to H. sapiens through the above lineage, followed by migration through the Levant into Europe.  Of course, there is the very real (probable) possibility that I am jumping the gun a bit on this. I hate that  missing link  press gush.
1	It&#8217;s a program about how the story could have gotten started. There is a scenario of how someone with a large boat that traded animals saw a large storm coming. He and his family grabbed everything they could and survived the flood. There are some scientist that give some interesting facts. It all sounded reasonable to me, or something like that.
0	And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it’s hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists? Since they share the same society, put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way, eat, sleep, and share economic processes in comparable ways, it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms. (like the word, “theory”) 
1	So if women choose to abort for reasons of:  a) poverty  b) career  c) religion  d) family pressure  they are not freely choosing abortion? I'm convinced there's more air filling your head with every post you make. If I didn't know you, I'd swear this was an (almost as idiotic) pro-lifer post concerning the incapability of women to make their own decisions.
0	Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations.

0	Students become confused when the school curriculum implies that what their parents taught them is wrong.
1	Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking.
1	Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.  We're waiting to hear about three or four more.  As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want.
1	Oh, I have little doubt that there are more abortions.  I think its pretty clear that legalising encourages abortion: its very hard to support it while saying abortion is murder, while drug legalisation can be supported by people very strongly campaigning against drugs (Mo Mowlam for example, here in Britain).
0	So where will you be moving to?
0	You advocate choice to one out of two parties involved in a pregnancy....let us be clear that you are telling the person of rape that they had no choice could just as easily not exist.
0	Perfect. A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums. Resistance is met, run like a coward to another forum.
1	Quite false.The fossil record shows that life started as "simple" single-celled life - bacteria - about 3.5 billion years ago. More complex multicellular life did not appear in the fossil record for nearly 2.5 billion years. And then what we find are only very simple multicellular life forms, such as the simple bilaterian Vernanimalcula about 580 to 600 million years ago. A few million years later in the fossil record we find more complex organisms, like trilobites, but nothing complex like a reptile, bird, or mammal. Later we find jawless fishes making their appearance, followed by jawed fishes, then amphibians, then reptiles, then transitional forms leading from reptiles to mammals, then primates, and then humans.
1	Your argument is moot. The Iraq population wasn't heavily armed, only the Taliban and soldiers.
1	So newborn babies only have no Christian beliefs because Satan has removed them?  My position would be that the 'natural' (read:before external influences) state of a person is atheism, for the same reason that you 'naturally' have no belief in gremlins. People aren't born with beliefs, they are naturalised into them - whatever that belief may be.
1	No, I am telling you that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. That the courts loose interpretation of the Constitution in Roe v. Wade (claiming that the right to privacy includes the right to deny and kill prebirth children) has resulted in  the people  making laws and policies which are intended to counter the Supreme Courts reckless decision.

1	It depends, now, doesn't it.  What are you looking to do with it. It is a great set of stories to derive moral principles out of, if you look at it in the proper light (THe key is stories). From a historical point of view, it gives insight into the culture and concepts of an early people.  Like anything, it is what you make of it.
0	I think bringing "emotions" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to "non-belief" would be irrelevant (and irrational).
1	Everything to do with the age of the Universe is part of evolution . The god of time and chance , the Almighty IT, is the evolution theory.  Without long ago and far far away evolution is dead.
1	Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe.
0	Just laugh ok, it's my first attempt at making up a joke lol  I guess it would only be funny for an anti-evolutionist, not like yourself.  A bit like trying to make a hillbilly laugh at the red-neck jokes or make an Irish man laugh at three men jokes (Enlishman, Scotsman and Irishman).
1	Well, if that is your perspective, yes, I can see why you would think they are the same idea. However, the differences between the two theories are much, much more fundamental than just the wording.Perhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs, while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence. Although it is true that ID has theological implications, the same could be said of evolution, the big bang, and, for that matter, any theory regarding the origin of biology and the universe. Creationism, on the other hand, is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science.Because it is theologically based, each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist:1. Apes and humans did not share a common ancestor.2. The earth is about six thousand years old.3. Life on earth did not have a common ancestor.4. Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits.5. Belief in catastrophism, usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation.6. There was a sudden creation of the universe, life, and energy from nothing.None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory. Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence, it is a much more unassuming theory. ID proposes the following:1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design. 2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity. 3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity. 4. As a result of the above three points, Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems.

1	In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic "mutation" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.

1	Actually, that's not true. The standard upon which the "super accurate atomic clocks" are based is slightly different from the actual rotation of the earth. It is as if you had two clocks that kept time slightly differently. I have to adjust the time on my grandfather clock all the time - every time I raise the weights I reset it to the correct time. It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works. It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week. I'm still adjusting.That's what is happening with the "leap seconds" that occur from time to time. The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times, one of which is very accurate, the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year.

1	Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.  And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere.  SNIP  Stuart Taylor Jr. is NOT on your side. A Right to Keep and Bear Arms? - The Atlantic (March 20, 2007)  No it f****n' isn't! If that was the case then Plessy v. Ferguson should have been used as precedent for all the following cases that dealt with segregation and racism. In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.  Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.
0	how is it discrimination when they aren't being denied rights everyone else has? They have no right that I don't have. Read my previous posts before you respond.  Also affirmative action is helping those that are disadvantaged to do the same things that those that aren't disadvantaged like the American wiht Disabilites act. It's not asking to give them different rights.
1	Nope, I don't deal in fiction and hyperbole; I just deal in facts unlike the gun grabbers you support with wild off the wall claims they can't prove and neither can you prove your "theory", you are far removed from reality.
0	Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
1	Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.
1	The theatre is private property. They can disallow guns on the premises.  Escorting him out was likely legal and they let him back in without his gun.  Only detaining him outside and searching him seems to have been a violation of his rights.

1	You actually can vote on this (of have your legislatures do it). Some issues require more than just a majority but you can still vote. If 80% of the people think all Jewish persons should live in Florida then its not looking for those Jewish persons that don't wish to live in Florida. This doesn't mean its the right thing to do but this is a flaw of democracy.

1	Most of the time one should be able to tell the sex of the baby by about 20 weeks and very often even at sixteen. Second trimester starts at 12 weeks. You canÂ’t get an abortion after determining the sex because its illegal.  Where are you getting your data?
1	But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on.
1	Really, what is the materialistinc approach to which you refer (assuming you're also talking about 'pain')?  a) Is it strictly materialistic, or do they use non-material methods as well? b) Can it be used to onbjectively measure pain?
0	So then you're alright with an organization that actively hung people from trees and committed murder for the sake of intimidating those that wanted to be able to vote, ride up front on buses, have decent facilities, etc.  Nice to know where you stand. White supremacists support gun control.

0	I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.  Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation.
0	Well both could be a good mother because i know a mother who was very certain she didn't want her baby and went for an abortion but was too late on in her pregnancy to have one and then she was going to give himup fpr adoption but as soon as he was born she loved him and couldn't bear to give him up and know she's a great Mum. Being a good mother mainly depends on what you are like with you're child after birth.

1	Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.
1	What's stupid about this is that it's not an opinion question where whoever can defend their point better wins.  Intelligent Design  is not science, so why should it be in the science class rooms? The person who is on the negative is already at a huge advantage because they are right, and the other guy is wrong. The end, /gg.
1	Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles.
1	That begs the question , do you feel the New Testament is useful?  As far as useful it did teach that you should wash after touching a dead body. Until a Creationist popularized the idea many died needlessly.  It also begs the question , what are the social benefits of Darwinism?

If he can't get reality right in current events, just how accurate do you think he is in history? Yuk, yuk, yuk. Just a portent of how skewed his upcoming book will be with all his bias and semi-literate "facts".

That their religious beliefs and freedom is more important then gay equality and civil rights.  2 Heteros that believe that gay people are sick, diseased, less then human, and that their family structure is the only one that should exist.  In both cases groups that have a sense that they are privleged and their privlege is more important then the rights and lives of gay people.

They hold a certain opinion on something completley unrelated to prove that WND does not know what its talking about....Nothing to back this claim up, nor any attempt to show contradicting data. They mysteriously have data from a website from what I could tell was last updated in 1996 that does not even ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT USE OF GUNS IN CRIME!Pitiful.
0	fn 57 ammo that is sold in America is not Armour piercing. further more they make Armour piercing ammo for many many hand guns so pretty much any handgun given military ammo will pierce a vest. also any deer rifle will pierce a vest so are they going to ban those too? no, the gun is just being singled out i don't know why but it is.  also fn has sued any one calling there gun a cop killer.
1	But felons can't vote and I don't see that in the Constitution, either. I don't have a problem with preventing criminals from legally owning firearms. That said, I think it's against our rights to be assumed to be a criminal without ever being convicted of a crime.
1	Oh, and I found this from here:  http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.   It appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. And the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. The only one getting anything wrong here is you.

0	Then why aren't doctors who advise rest and plenty of fluids for a cold in jail? Oh right, because you're lying, as usual.
1	So since you admit there's been a "radical change" in biology do you still think neo-darwinism explains evolution? If so, how...if not...what is your new explantion?
1	I hate to break this to you but this is racked with illogic.  Well, ok it's  logical  but the premises rely on things that are pure assumptions.  Just because something can't be detected doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  And, of course, if god is god the way we think about it, then God is everywhere, including in this universe. He is the universe (but we can't detect him). Does he exist now or not?
1	But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being.
1	No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.
1	Consider the source ...Planned Parenthood is far from an objective source. For example:From PP site..."Claim:Many women who have an abortion suffer severe and lasting psychological damage.Expert Opinion:Serious emotional problems following abortion are uncommon. Most women report a sense of relief, although some may experience temporary depression. Serious psychological disturbances after abortion occur less frequently than after childbirth. "I know 2 women, both had abortions 30 years ago and they both regret it every day. A lot of their other "expert opinions" were nothing more than pro-abortion spin.
1	It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small.  By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.
1	well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.
1	Because internal variability from the likes of ENSO, which can cause short term swings of a full degree C, easily swamp the smaller increase we'd expect from CO2 forcing. Easy.
1	So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. "POOF! Goddidit!" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk.
1	What's wrong with that? Lots!Rational thought alone keeps a person from doing just anything s/he wants. Should I, an atheist, kill another person’s children just to see if that person will then hate me? No, I shouldn’t. Doing so would be grossly immoral. I guess God couldn’t figure that one out for himself … poor Job … poor Job’s children.There’s also the simple fact that we moral humans recognize the difference between being treated fairly and unfairly, and we even feel empathy, both of which even chimps seem to do at at least a rudimentary level. So do you argue that chimps must already believe in God?It doesn't take religion to know of fairness or to be able to put oneself in another's shoes and consider how that person would feel based on our actions. 
0	So? The point was that people who support gun control are not necessarily communists.
0	Once again noting how you think that you should be the one to define what evolutionary biologists mean by the words they use. You want to lump all of science that you find in disagreement with you religion under one term, without making an honest effort to understand any of it.
1	Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine).
1	Again, you are mistaken. ALL of these groups compete for multiple things, and I'll give you real, concrete examples you might even be able to find watching Animal Planet.1.) Animals compete for mates ALL THE TIME. Have you never seen male lions fighting each other, or elk, hyenas, etc, etc? They fight, the stronger one wins, and the female selects the victor to be her mate, and they produce offspring that likely would grow up to be stronger than those produced by the other male.2.) Animals compete for resources ALL THE TIME. Nature moves in cycles. Regions experience dry periods, wet periods, cold periods, hot periods, etc. Therefore, viable sources for food fluctuate from season to season. At one point, for example, there may be more predators than prey. With not enough food to go around for entire populations of predators, only those with the ability to go long periods of time without food, or can more effectively find food before other individuals in the population, will survive and those that cannot will likely die. When you get into animals that live in groups (packs, herds, etc.) you will find that competition occurs between these groups. (I am reminded of a famous scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey)That's really all I have to offer to this debate, hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points, seeing as I'm hardly the expert. supersport, I have been watching your posting strategy, and frankly you seem to be shooting yourself in the foot; most of the things you claim as "facts" are downright false. I genuinely want to hear where you get such claims, but I fear you'll just ignore me like you ignore everybody else who makes a point. Please, address my points. If not, you can expect a PM from me. I just want to know where you get this stuff.

You've got to be kidding me. I also notice that you claim to have had a private conversation with Andrew Ingersol in which you pointed out an error that he had made. I suspect that you are a liar or a thief. But of course! You are a creationist!I also notice that you don't seem to have made an attempt to educate yourself by checking out the sources I gave you. Moreover, you still haven't presented any evidence for creation. You keep claiming that there is some. Why do you refuse to present it?

0	But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.

1	In point of fact, the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion, but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it. See this study, for instance: http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB...heet/fsest.htmPeople have small families because they want small families. In point of fact, the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US, due, again, to education and contraception. Would you force folks to have children they don't want?

1	Some civil unions do not grant all the rights of marriage. However, if we assume they do, then the only differences are the name, the meaning society associates with the name (that is, society is more likely to give the morality behind same-sex relationships equal consideration if they are treated equally under the law), and the fact that they are different institutions under the law. The fact that they are different institutions would allow a future law to be passed applying to one but not the other. This could also present the following problem: let's say a governor recieves a bill passed by the legislature which grants benefits to both civil unions and marriage. The governor could line-item veto the benefits to civil unions, making those benefits only for marriage.
0	Because they don't know any better. Besides, how many unwanted pregnancies have you had? How many abortions? Notice that most anti-choicers are men, which exposes the true hypocrisy in this dogma of thinking.

Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!

Who are you recommending should use self-restraint?  The protestors?  Or are you saying, self-restraint is your recommendation for birth control?
1	Yes, that does seem to be the primary concern, and it does seem to be that the the cost of the program could be considerable. However, I do ask again that you at least consdier the following, presented by the Center for Gun Policy and Research, part of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. (Link on an above post.)  ...the costs of creating, maintaining, and using a federal system are likely to be substantial. The projected costs of the system must be weighed against the potential to reduce the enormous social and economic costs associated with gun violence. Eighty lives per day?almost 29,000 per year?are lost to gun violence in the United States.16 The social costs of gun violence in the United States have been estimated to be an extraordinary $100 billion per year.17 If ballistic fingerprinting laws result in significant reductions in gun violence? by strengthening law enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violent offenders and deterring illegal gun use by and transfers to criminals and youth?the investment will be well worth it.  Also,  -In 1994, the lifetime medical costs associated with firearm injuries and deaths totaled $2.3 billion.  - Approximately 49% of the costs of gun-related injuries and deaths is paid by the public.  -The hospitalization costs associated with firearm-related injuries in 1997 exceeded $800 million.  -Thirty percent (30%) of hospitalized patients were uninsured, and an additional 30% were enrolled in government health insurance programs.  -The direct costs (e.g., medical, productivity) and social costs (e.g., quality of life, emotional) of gun violence are an estimated $100 billion per year  Like I have, said, it seems that perhaps not enough research has been done, to figure out precisely what the program will cost, and how how effective it would be. But I am suprised that there are those who seem so set against even considering such a program, when it appears that there may be a substantial benefit.

I always assumed it was a mixture of physiology, luck, etc. Sometimes bad things happen, sometimes good things happen. But you claimed God was the one who saw you through and made sure your daughter was born healthy and functional...So, again, in a similar situation (trust in God, doctors say baby will be born damaged, etc), if it turns out the doctors were right, is God to blame for letting me down? Or was it, in fact, just the way things are sometimes?Or does God just randomly hear some prayers, but not others? No, no...lemme guess. "God has a plan for us all"?

Are you saying that because US society is bigoted then it is right to pander to the bigots and allow them to dictate the rules of society?  Oh and BTW, the British Army openly allows homosexuals as well, and seems to function well enough too.
0	The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.
1	Well, of course the issue isn't  limiting  marriage, but rather making it more open-ended.  But again, either way, it'll be a moot point before too long.
1	Just to repeat what I think others are saying, when we talk about the  single common ancestor  of all life, we are not speaking of an individual, but a population of organisms belonging to a single species.  Nor is this to say that there weren't other species existing at this time -- just one of them left descendents that are still extant.  And some current theories suggest that there may not have been a single ancestral species, at least not in terms of our genetic heritage. I believe that there is some belief that  lateral gene transfer  was a huge component of evolution way back when, mixing up the lineages quite well.

I would support capital punishment if we only convicted guilty men ... that is not the case. The list of men on death row who were found to be innocent and released is long and growing, and we can only guess how many innocents have been put to death.

Anyone who has had surgery can tell you that being put to sleep with chemicals is absolutely painless. Deterrent? Do states with the death penalty have a lower murder per capita than those that do?

1	I've added one now. It's the first result if you google 'Creation: where's'. It's also the top article in AiG's 'Get Answers' section, which is linked directly from the navigation bar on their front page.
1	Well I'm pretty sure if it was cyber-enhancements then that dog never would have been born for you to see. It would be in a lab somewhere. You are right that it is possible that this is the case, but over time you would have found out about it assuming the dog was born for you to see indicating there is no cover-up or secret made of it and you would learn all about it in the future. A year goes by, scientists say it was genuine evolution. Would that be enough evidence?
1	The fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method. There is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being, and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact, yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god. Mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others I have spoke with on this subject. I do believe in scientific method, but I also have faith that god is out there.

1	Well read this link, http://www.realwomenca.com/newslette...article_1.html  Why take my word for it when you can read it for yourself from professionals, professors, mental health studies, etc. This link also disclaims the links you have listed. Finding flaws in their studies. So thats my source, and thats my stand.
1	Yes.

1	And we know this how? You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?
1	This obviously depends on the person. Both are not good...once again, a comparision is not gonna work. Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic(not a real word) you will still mess up your health (which is a good reason we shouldn't have public health care).
0	Yes.... 10% of the population has a disorder (homosexuality) that they refuse to deal with in the proper way do to the fact they believe that the majority should just except there so called "sexual orientation" and treat it like it is as normal as a traditional relationship between a man and a woman. I'm sorry, but I cannot except this concept that your "orientation" is on the same playing field as mine. It is not. Abdominable and wrong behavior do not deserve rights.
0	Oh come on, only now you're going to be picky about that? I could have sworn we all agreed to use that term insted of using some of the other more radical monachers. So now you want to change the rules because some wild hair got stuck crossways? Typical.

0	So Darwin (the naturalist) didn't care at all about science or nature and was instead all about politics and destroying his own religion, huh?  More belligerent ranting, I see. All Democrats have secretly joined forces with the EAC, right? Funny how the side baselessly accusing  evolutionists  of reckless politicking is.. well, recklessly politicking.

0	But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.  What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?
0	The most anti-family people I've come across are those who beat their breasts, demonise gays, and pretend they are  for families . They don't give a damn about children, all they care about is their homophobic religion.
0	SoC,  Abortion targets a very specific group of human beings: unwanted, unborn children.  Would you, then, REALLY prefer that some nameless, faceless government bureaucrat control the future of a woman's pregnancy instead of the woman herself?  If so, what penalty would you have the government impose on a woman and her physician if they committed what you must believe is the  crime  of terminating her pregnancy?  BTW, hve you put your money where your mouth is by going to a pregnant woman and saying to her,  I will adopt your child and provide it with the love, discipline, and money needed to have it become a productive member of our society. , or, like so many profetallifers, does your concern stop at birth?

1	Well, the now late Dr Crick can have all the odd ideas he wants, but unless it is backed up by evidence, it isn't science.Yes, naturalism is a presupposition. On the other hand, it works. It makes predictions and it lets us do such things as make the very computer you are using. What kind of verifiable and repeatable predictions supernaturalism makes??

0	And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.
0	yea...it's like ordering a pizza. First the paleontologist digs up a bone or other artifact...then he calls the lab, tells them what he found and gives them the date they can expect the bone to arrive for "testing." Then the lab asks him from what organism the bone once belonged and also what toppings, I mean dates, he wants for his bone. Then the paleontologist gives him the range of dates that most suit his presuppositions.....Then the paleontologists sends in the bone fed-ex, along with a gift-certificate to the finest steakhouse in town and two tickets to the ballgame, and then sits back and waits for the results. Finally, just to be on the safe side, the paleontologist repeats this scenario with at least 2 more labs...this way just in case one doesn't cooperate he has backup and he can pick a date from any number of labs.
1	Just common sense. If a mutation provides some benefit, it tends to be retained. Over time, (sometimes over a very short time) this can produce a new structure as we see in this case.

1	 The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia. In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private. The public had a claim for public purposes. Coxe was a strong Federalist. He was employed in Hamilton's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion. He expressed no concerns that the enrollment and inventory requirements of the Militia Act would infringe on right of the people to keep and bear their private arms.   http://www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html#coxe  So Tench Coxe put quite a bit a faith in the power of the militia? George Washington and Alexander Hamilton didn't agree. They thought that the militia was no match for a regular army.   Regular troops alone are equal to the exignencies of modern war, as well for defense as for offense.... No militia will ever acquire the habits necessary to resist regular force.... The Firmness requisite for the real business of fighting is only to be attained by a constant course of discipline and service. I have never been yet been witness to a single instance that would justify a different opinion.   (Letter from George Washington to the President of Congress- September 15,1780)   Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its  natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national  defense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have lost us our  independence. It cost millions to the United States that might have been  saved. The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance of  this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a  suggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular and  disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the  same kind.  -Alexander Hamilton  http://federalistpapers.com/federalist25.html
0	That is the point. They are not neighbors, there are in a relationship and would get married if they could. I know my partner and I would! But despite your fancy wording they did stop Gay Partner Benefits. Hundreds lost there healthcare, now those people will take their tax money and leave Va. most likely to go to Mass. where they can have healthcare. And those in Mass who disagree with gay marriage may move to Va. Again, soon we will be a divided nation.
1	Well, we can go through a list from Live human sacrifice, infraticide, slavery in the Roman empire, to sexual morality, and the treatment of Wmen - Mother's and their children.We might need a new thread for this topic!Most elucidating, and worth quoting is:In the Syballine Oracles, written by an Egyptian Jew probably between 163 and 45 B.C., the author compared Jews to the other nations: The Jews “are mindful of holy wedlock, and they do not engage in impious intercourse with male children, as do Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Romans, specious Greece and many nations of others, Persians and Galatians and all Asia.” And in our times, sex historian Amo Karlen wrote that according to the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, “Homosexuality was phenomenally rare among Orthodox Jews.” To a world which divided human sexuality between penetrator and penetrated, Judaism said, “You are wrong — sexuality is to be divided between male and female.” To a world which saw women as baby producers unworthy of romantic and sexual attention, Judaism said, “You are wrong — women must be the sole focus of men's erotic love.” To a world which said that sensual feelings and physical beauty were life's supreme goods, Judaism said, “You are wrong — ethics and holiness are the supreme goods.” A thousand years before Roman emperors kept naked boys, Jewish kings were commanded to write and keep a sefer torah, a book of the Torah. ....nothing moved me more than the Talmudic law that Jews were forbidden to sell slaves or sheep to non-Jews, lest the non-Jews engage in homosexuality and bestiality. That was the world in which rabbis wrote the Talmud, and in which, earlier, the Bible was written. Asked what is the single greatest revelation I have derived from all my researches, I always respond, i “That there had to have been divine revelation to produce the Torah.” The Torah was simply too different from the rest of the world, too against man's nature, to have been solely man-made. The creation of Western civilization has been a terribly difficult and unique thing. It took a constant delaying of gratification, and a re-channeling of natural instincts; and these disciplines have not always been well received. There have been numerous attempts to undo Judeo-Christian civilization, not infrequently by Jews (through radical politics) and Christians (through anti-Semitism). The bedrock of this civilization, and of Jewish life, has been the centrality and purity of family life. But the family is not a natural unit so much as it is a value that must be cultivated and protected. The Greeks assaulted the family in the name of beauty and Eros. The Marxists assaulted the family in the name of progress. Judaism’s Sexual Revolution: Why Judaism (and then Christianity) Rejected Homosexuality - Click Here
0	Well, that's not exactly true.I don't put absolute faith in the results of science, but I do trust that scientists are not lying.They may be wrong, but I don't defend what they say to the death.I don't have an absolute belief in what they have found or the conclusions they've drawn.I tend to "believe" the big bang theory, but I have serious doubts as to its validity.I think the ability to change your mind about things as they come is what makes it not faith.Trusting scientists that they aren't lying doesn't mean that I have faith in what they say.Faith is a really strong word.edit - Oh, I also realize what you are saying so I'll try to explain.Scientists publish their results in journals.Their methods and results are there for everyone to see.All you and I have to do is go to a library that subscribes to the journal, or personally subscribe to it, and look up their work.If you had a problem with what they did, you can do your own experiments to prove them wrong, or at least make your case why you think they are wrong.Now, getting your results published is another can of worms.But, anyway, you or I don't have to be published to redo the experiments ourselves, but that might take some money.Anyway, all I'm saying is that once something is published, it's not written in stone.It doesn't become infallible scripture.People who read it, "believe" it (or not), based on their own knowledge of the subject. Results and conclusions are challenged all the time. Interpretations are modified all the time.I really don't see what any of this has to do with Faith.
0	You lost this debate Skeptic, why drag it back up again? There are plenty of other subjects that we could debate instead. Pick one of them and let's debate again. Alternatively, how about a formal debate on ID in which you never once mention Behe? That'll be a completely different one and worth considering.
1	Why would they go away? Birds still have bird feet. How are they a hinderance? Have you looked at the feet of tridactyl dinosaurs? Are you aware that dinosaur tracks were at first thought to be the tracks of large birds? Wouldn't "bird feet" be beneficial to an animal that lived in trees?

1	According to data collected from each nation's embassy-  In 1996, handguns were used to murder 2 people in New Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada and 9,390 in the United States.   Would you rather have a lot of gun deaths or only a few? And tell me of a law that is 100% effective. There are traffic laws, but there are still car accidents. Does that mean we shouldn't have any traffic laws? No, not if those traffic laws lead to a reduction in car accidents which they do.  As for the second amendment and whether gun ownership is a right or a priviledge we can discuss later.
1	I thought races were created at the Tower of Babel, not by a loss of genetic information. Oh wait, of course, that's how the FSM did it, but the Christians have it all wrong. This mutation was not created by His Noodly Appendage at the Tower of Babel at all. It was the Pillar of Barilla. Must be an old mistranslation.
0	Thank you for repeating me.
1	The Big Bang arose from a singularity not from nothing.  This is a clear sign that th reader doesn't understand cosmology or science.  Yet we are supposed to believe that a God created the universe out of nothing especially since there is no shred of evidence for a God.  This topic is covered extensively in the online monthly magazine - Science and Discovery. These folks also debunk the Bible and other religious nonsence.  The name of the organization which I suggest everyone look at is Science Club of Long Island.

1	There are more people who live together as couples now than say 20 or 30 years ago.If you are a middle aged man and do not realise this then you should get out more..if you are much younger then you can take it from me or google the relevant phrase.Whether there is much difference between now and a couple of years ago...dont know.
1	Guns surely have their uses in situations such as that. I support peoples right to own a gun but I also think there would be more crimes and death if everyone in the whole country owned a gun. Just got to make sure gun use doesn't get too out of hand.
1	Science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works.
0	I never said you had to be armed, you merely cannot deprive me of my right to be armed, which is the nature of gun control. Your counterpoint was not reflective of my words.
0	Because of my rH factor I have had several spontaneous abortions. I have never needed to have an induced abortion.  I am very sorry to note that I felt not a whit of regret over my abortions. I had more important things to attend to.
1	Jesus! Another scientific illiterate. The facts are the observations. And the point is not to test facts but to explain them with an hypothesis that suggests a prediction as a consequence that can be tested by experimentation.
1	But it is useful...
0	You are SO insulting.   Oh, the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly.   Who are you to say they aren't thinking clearly? I'll give it to you, Bassman. You are the most polite, best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered. You nearly had me fooled.
1	You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.  I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up.  So sorry, but you struck out.
1	This isn't my position. I'm arguing that your attempts to demonize magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds is foolish. Furthermore, if no honest citizen needs a 15 round magazine, then no police officer needs them either. If we can reload them quickly enough for it to not matter, then the police can do it too.
0	And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.
0	Oh, ye man of little faith! ;)  I regard it as highly unlikely to happen, but one never knows...
0	Ok, now I'd like to know why Lappster thinks evolution has anything to do with morality? Do you actually know what evolution is Lappster?
1	Huh? For one thing, it demonstrates that 'gun control' does not equal a reduction in crime. Another thing, 'registration leads to confiscation'. Remember that next a politician HERE makes that suggestion (See also; Nazi Germany). And yet another, is the fact that anti-gunners often celebrate these 'successes' in Britain and Australia and model their own attempts to disarm Americans after the British and Australian plans.  Next question...
1	I believe this is a clear and concise way of putting it. Regarding number 2, pro-life people believe there is a moral responsibility and, if the woman does not believe the same, wish to make it into a legal responsibility.  I think Duo's question was directed mostly at Voice of Reason The same question has been posed to him time and time again and he weasels out of it.  ETA, Jitobear, I just noticed you and I joined in the same month :P
1	just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.
1	Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.  Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.

1	Possibly, depends on what you read and by whom. Still, the war wasn't aganist slavery.
0	Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.
0	If our guns are mearly popguns as you just described them, then why do you want to take them from us so badly. Maybe you are considering a life of crime as a carrer, and your afraid of being shot, is that whats really going on here.emoticon_cry
1	What else can you expect from a leftist media. It would go against the agenda to show any thing else. After every liberal knows a firearm owner is a bumbling red neck, racist, sexist drooling dim wit.
1	Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.
0	Are you trying to make a point here? Or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?One of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. There's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. Instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.Kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with TV shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. Parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.We need massive reform. We gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.
0	Just another one of Chuzlife's overgeneralizing personal attacks. Along with child molester, mass murderer, ad nauseum ...  Chuzlife may not need God, but he needs the good guys and the bad guys in his worldview.
1	Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA.
1	Because even if we never know all the details, the theory is sound since ever increasing numbers of observations are consistent with the theory. Not so for Biblical literalist types that are forced to deal with ever increasing refutation of their beliefs.
1	Actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. This is illegal. You can't make it more illegal than it already is.  Shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around. Nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around. Many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law.  As far as puncture wounds, do stabbings count?  Or, as it appears, are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?
0	oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you "think" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.
1	Nonsense. The US has yet to become a democracy. In any case, the republic-style government (democracy of the elite) replicates ancient Athenian government very closely, and is a very twisted take on the Haudenaushonee (6 Nations- Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, Cayuga, Tuscarora), who were an actual democracy thousands of years before European invasion.
0	So that no girl, underage or otherwise, refuses to seek treatment for fear of what their parents will think or say. If a girl cannot be tested for a STD without parental notification and she does not wish her parents to know she had sex (or fears their wrath), she may not go in for testing.  In general, knowing whether you have a STD is a good thing.
1	You need to read the whole article before you make such statements. The point of the article is that the provisions for divorce that are available to heterosexual married couples are NOT available to same-sex married couples because of the discriminatory federal law (DOMA) and because of state laws that do not recognize same-sex marriage, thus not allowing for legal divorce. Read the whole article and see what you think. Shouldn't all married couples have access to equal rights and provisions for division of property when they divorce?
1	Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.
1	Public policy protects us -or at least attempts to- from really unhealthy foods through nutritional information labels. People who choose to eat unhealthy foods do so despite knowing that doing so may lead to health problems. Besides being careful not to get into situations where you are likely to be shot, people don't have much control over whether or not someone pulls a gun on them, and that is why most people are more afraid of being killed by someone else's gun than their own eating habits.
0	Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want "guilty by association" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice. 
1	Homo Sapien hasn't existed for millions of years. It would be more appropriate to say that the Earth has provided the basis for life for hundreds of millions of years.
1	Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I don't agree with this. I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena, only speculations as to what (if anything) may have happened before the Big Bang. If anything did (eg previous Big Crunch) that is not outside time, that is only time that is inaccessible to us in terms of observation.
1	We've been doing that for quite some time. Anyone who can click on the threads can see that.  no, you just live on delusions.  you can't argue the merits of creationism on their own because they don't exist.  Creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution.

0	This is what liberals don't understand. They want a  Stalinistic  America, they think everything will be fine once they get free medicine (which isn't free, we'll all be paying 60% taxes), and all the guns are gone. Then we'll be free like the Cubans. All that education and no way to apply it, unless the state authorizes it of course.... After all you silly slave, the gov't makes the decisions, not you.
1	Of course not. No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was. Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths. Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again. That is evolution. It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause. You see, no one has proposed another explanation that has stood up to examination. Majerus is trying to verify that the evolution really was the result of predation by birds. It seems a reasonable hypothesis but Majerus had several quibbles with Kettlewell's methodology even though he believes the hypothesis to be correct.
0	It won't. I'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active (a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion. Like vehicle insurance she may never need it, but going without either one is plain stupid.
1	Agreed. The lower class also fails to realize that with a volunteer military at war they become the sole source of cannon fodder and that the wealthy pay disproportionate taxes for legislation to contain the lower and middle classes by duping them with the American Dream.
1	sonar is more than that; it's a method of communication.http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20041025/bat.htmlWhenever females heard sonar sounds from another female, they would call less frequently, likely to tune in to what the other female was communicating. According to the researchers, female bats interact mainly with other females in complex hierarchies during their lives, so that could be why they take more of an interest in echolocation sounds from their own sex......She told Discovery News, "The connection of the two studies is in the idea that bat communication is more complex than previously documented, since research is finding a variety of social calls to be communicating territory defense and mate attraction, as well as sonar calls, previously thought to only function in prey capture and navigation, to also have a communication role."

1	 A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon.   The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.   In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'   The News regrets the error.

1	But there is evidence that we do evolve. I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry.
0	And better yet, ask Sinjin what he and his cohorts are doing to teach gun safety? How much did he and or the Anti-gun orgs spend? The NRA spent more then 20 MILLION Dollars to teach children to STOP! DON'T TOUCH, LEAVE THE AREA, TELL AN ADULT!  The NRA probably could and would do more however, EVEN JUST THAT, is called indoctrination by the Anti-gun crowed, and apparently even Sinjin! So is the criticism fair? Is the comparison he made fair?
1	A modern court requires signed affidavits or sworn testimony. These five hundred people remain unnamed and carry on with their lives as if it never happened. How would a modern court view the hearsay of 500 witnesses and no resultant effect of the allegation?
1	Well that's true under one condition: that there is such thing as a random mutation that creates a new, beneficial body part or function. I'm not sure this has ever been established as fact. (How does science go about proving randomness in a mutation, anyway?...it seems to me that one must accept that mutations are random by faith.)"It is our contention that if ‘random’ is given a serious and crucial interpretation from a probabilistic point of view, the randomness postulate is highly implausible and that an adequate scientific theory of evolution must await the discovery and elucidation of new natural laws."—*Murray Eden, "Inadequacies of Neo-Darwinian Evolution as Scientific Theory," in Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Theory of Evolution (1967), p. 109.This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on, preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others.but if the variation is nonrandom, it doesn't matter: selection's role, like I said above, would be doing nothing more than eliminating the weaklings. According to ToE, selection is a creative force of evolution, guiding the direction of evolution.Gould:The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics — the forces that produce the raw material of genetic variation — are random, in the special sense of “not inherently directed toward adaptation.” That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur“at random,” in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction — and be the creative force of evolution — by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes.

Spare us the tired michael moore government vs corporations rhetoric, it's obvious they're both on the same side.

1	Completely wrong. One CAN prove a negative by showing that it is self contradictory (ie a square circle). Also, proving a positive claim WRONG is not the same as proving a negative claim correct. In that sense, theories most definitely CAN be proven wrong, as Creationism has. The predictions which Creationism makes were false. It was dismissed a long time ago.

0	How do you define "convenience"?
1	And that's almost certainly how things were at least once in the past: several hominid species migrating, competing, evolving - we're the descendants of the ones that won. That's what you fail to appreciate by continuing to insist that 'science says' fossil hominids are our ancestors. Science says no such thing. Science says this was Planet of the Apes - and we won.Why are there still chimps, then? Because they weren't competing with us. Think: the same ecological reasons why chimps couldn't evolve our level of intelligence made it not worth our while to fight them for that territory. Doesn't that make beautiful, perfect sense? Only since we've started exporting our ecology, cutting down jungles and so on - only since then have we come into competition with them, to their cost. If we're not careful, the answer to the fatuous question "If we evolved from chimps, why are there still chimps" will be "there aren't".It's silly to attach significance to the fact we're the 'only' intelligent species. For a start, we're not the 'only' - we're the first. Intelligence - our 'level' of it - was never inevitable; it's not some ultimate goal, any more than swimming or flying. But assuming it happens, someone has to be first, and we're it. Secondly, we're not the 'only' - we're the most. So far. And we're getting smarter - so don't be so quick to declare us the pinnacle; you have no idea what peaks are hidden in the clouds ahead. If we're lucky, in a million years the smartest creature will be one of our descendants, but it could just as easily be whatever creature emerges to claim the territory we leave behind when we become extinct.THREAD REVIEW
1	Oddly enough, the Mass constitution reads:Article XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it. So apparently they came to their senses later.
0	That is amazing. I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted. Abortion is murder.
1	There isn't anything controversial about the articles claims, it has long been recognised that mammals evolved from reptile stock, who where descended from amphibians whose ancestors where fish.
1	I think you got it backwards Kelvin. You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow.

1	Yeah. Funny thing about that.  NONE of what you quoted includes any discussion of money raised...  They organized marches. Yes.  They had phone banks for the purpose of persuading undecided voters. Yes.  But no mention of money raised...  And don't get me wrong. I am against the organizing of marches and the phone banks.  But if we're going to start indicting on that as well, please let me know cause the list of  guilty churches  just got a heck of a lot longer as opposed to just listing ones which had generated  $190,000  directly, and lots more from individual church members.

1	I think some of the courts that have quoted that sentence from Heller to justify laws that ban felons from owning firearms would disagree.   Longstanding prohibitions  in the sentence I quoted from Heller refers to restrictions on felons and the mentally ill not laws forbidding the carrying of concealed weapons in school areas. The last part of that sentence is interesting. It talks about  laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . I know that some have interpreted that part to mean that the Supreme Court is okay with such restrictions as one gun a month laws, waiting periods, and backgrounds checks. It's certainly something to think about.

1	So now you are saying that the earth doesn't move? I get it. The earth used to be fixed at the center of the universe when those Bible verses were written but God changed it. Now it orbits the sun like the other planets.Actually, the verse does say that grasshoppers have four legs. There is no mention of jumping legs. You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error.You "interpret" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.
1	No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.
1	Actually, for his hypothesis to explain the difference, he would have to say that the DNA changed. Even so, he assumes more.
1	It was a fair question for Tim to ask, even your beloved NRA web-site has the 2nd Amendment located in top-right. (http://www.nraila.com/issues/FactSheets/)  How does the law of contract explicitly protect your right to carry a gun?  Are you allowed to shoot someone if they breach a contract?  What about torts laws? - where a contract doesn't exist.
1	I believe I read this in the paper a few days ago, but I think the ban will be similiar to DC's in that it will ban handgun ownership.  As for the constitutionality of this? Since when have the Gun Grabbers ever worried about the Constitution?
1	But I don't hear you saying things like  baseball is always harmful to the player  or  baseball is something no one should have to go through.   You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.  Besides, no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place.
0	I think the answer to that is much like J.P. Morgan's famous retort when someone asked him how much his yacht cost. 'If you have to ask, you can't afford it'. I'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons couldn't afford them, but if the interest isn't already there, it's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question.
0	And you know this how?
1	So you think that only the sentence structure needs to be examined and not the meaning of the words?  The courts have the legal authority to interpret the second amendment, not Journalism teachers.

1	No, you just need to the same in proportion to the strength of the animal. Actually you probably need proportionally less to tie down an elephant because they have a worse power to weight ratio. The US, being a bigger country, has more money to spend on this. Also, having a higher population density than Canada would be an advantage, not a disadvantage, in the efficient provision of healthcare. I should also point out that the NHS manages to serve pretty much every area of the UK, including the tiny islands off the coast of Scotland and the remote North West Highlands.

1	The memo is real, nobody has ever been able to disprove it. Handgun Control Inc.

However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying  I never said that  and trying to reverse his position.  Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after.

1	While that may be true for some - perhaps even many - I was just responding to the OP. That said, I think it foolish to claim/believe that the bible is all wrong. I consider myself an atheist, but I fully recognize - and expect - that much, perhaps even most of the events mentioned in the bible actually occurred. I do, however, also realize that the books of the bible were written at a much different time, that even real events were likely embellished, in some cases to the point of absurdity (knocking down walls with great shouts and the like...). Although I do not and will not pretend to be a biblical scholar or historian of any sort, it seems to me that the bible could be seen as a biased, mythology-laden chronicle of the history of a particular group of people. Interesting historically, but not very reliable as a guide to the true events of the time, and even less so for a guide to moral behavior and describing a Universe-creating Deity.
0	Many who voted for this said as much. They're hoping that in a few years gays will actually get full rights. We can only hope.

That would be interesting. I'll get my popcorn ready
1	I think it's fair to say that if there was no God, then there would be no gay people...

1	Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by  friction .  By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.  Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation.
0	And who would pick the 'some'? Perhaps you also believe they should be placed on Ritilin...for their own protection...because their teachers (without medical training) diagnose the infamous ADD demon in them.  Not to get off topic too far, some teachers evidently have trouble recognizing the difference between students that can't seem to pay attention and themselves (the teachers) being in dire need of coming across as interesting.  What makes you think teachers or parents could ever become adept at recognizing who needs to put on birth control? Shall we wait 'til one becomes pregnant? Shall we offer a survey of sexual activities?...to what age group?
1	Yet, tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll. Regardless, in his report it was a minor point. From a realistic standpoint, it took nothing away from the report when he removed it. Lott was investigated for this, just like Bellisiles. He was not found guilty of any academic misconduct (unlike Bellesiles). When you consider the thousands fo data sets that he compiled to put that report together, the folks investigating him didn't think it was at all unbelieveable that he scoudn;t remeber the details of where that number came from. Again, though, he ended up removing that number from his report (the single place that it appeared) and apologised for using it since he could not provide the raw data or a good cite for it.Here is how he responded to the article you link to :http://johnrlott.tripod.com/malkinsoped.htmlIt is rather interesting, and well documented. It addresses a couple of inacuracies in the article, such as the misconseption that he had attributed the disputed numner to Kleck. 
0	No problem. I personally believe killing innocent children is wrong. Yet, I also believe that a woman's decision to murder her child is between her and her god. I wouldn't remove individual choice. It's not mine to make.  But this isn't the right forum for that.  Back to the OP: False dichotomy, or obfuscation and refusal to answer the stated question?

1	Really? I wasn't aware that the definition had changed. I do know that a definition was formulated as part of the modern synthesis back in the 1930s and 40s. That is the definition I learned some decades ago, it is the one I have always used, and it is the one that I still find in modern biology texts. It is also the one that all biologists that I know use, and of course the meaning definition of what evolutionary biologists mean when they talk about evolution should be determined by evolutionary biologists themselves. It seems kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that isn't what evolutionary biologists mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution.Let me put it this way, do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of Christianity if I were allowed to invent my own definition of what a Christian means when he talks about salvation?So please, please tell us about some of these changing defintions. Like I said, I've been using the same one for over 40 years and wasn't aware that it had changed.

1	I would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal. It is our essence. Our personality may impact or is impacted by it, but I would say it is far more. Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or "not god" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being. It should be an apparent paradox to me. If it is not, then my concept of God is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to small to be of any use to anyone.Huck.

1	Sigh. You defend your version of science by re-stating the definition of your version of science. That is circular reasoning.  If you read anything on the history of science you will know that your version is but one of many.  Isaac Newton sought out the hand of God, through science. He is a prime example of what I mean. He thought differently about science than you... as science could be used as a tool for furthering his understanding of God.
1	No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method.
1	I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.
1	Except in the Dred Scott case the court wasn't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right, or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery.
1	Well this doesn't matter. It would have to be free for the US to afford it. In fact, look for the UK to have troubles affording it as their debt pushes 100% of GDP like the US.
1	No it doesn't. It tells us that creationists are either liars of very sloppy in gathering samples. I suspect that you've been duped again, and as usual, nothing but assertion without evidence.
0	Why should your belief of that being the case take precedent over the belief that that is not the case?  What gives you (or any group) the right to impose your views on other people, directly affecting their rights, simply for an idea you have of  ideals  that not eveybody agrees with?
1	In science, a scientific method actually exists. There is no scientific method in creationism. Religion cannot use the scientific method.

Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing. 
0	Really?She was taken to two different hospitals and an ICU, and she still died? Health care has nothing to do with it. This seems like a desperate cry to change, but not unfair government work. SHE WAS GOING TO DIE REGARDLESS! This had nothing to do with being treated unfairly, but it had everything to do with a sob case that was misstated, and uncharged. It doesn't make sense, and unless it's changed, I don't think that it ever will.
1	lol, therere lot of  disorders  that dont prevent people from doing anything. if being blind is a disorder should they disallow blind people from getting married?  other than that, you'd be hard-pressed to classify  being gay  as a disorder  but in any event, just classifying something as a disorder is hardly every good grounds to disallow it. look up affirmative action (im black, by the way, just in case eyebrows start raising)
0	Is it only religious people who insite violence and hatred toward gays? NO!  You're attempting, weakly at that, to jump on the Frist-train by saying hes persecuting religious people. As if religious people are being singled out.

Sometimes he says what he thinks is true because he hasn't bothered to educate himself. At other times he tells intentional lies. Hey! You two seem to be a lot alike.

1	To Close_slave_can:  May be  overall  was the wrong word to use. By this, I mean, the whole naturalistic explaination about our origins. We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from  simple  organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.  You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.  It is this that I am refering to. It is the interpretation about the origins of the evidence that all the debates in this forum are caused by. Sorry for any misunderstanding.
0	So if a gay couple plans to adopt, they can get married?  And if a straight couple gets married, and then find out they can't have kids, does their marriage gets changed to a civil union? Or is it just desire to have kids?

1	The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves.
1	Since you redacted my previous statement, I repeat it for your benefit: There is nothing racist about the truth. Notice the underlying message in your posted article is about the Court of Appeals throwing her LAWSUIT out. That was the underlying agenda which motivated this racist jerk who also happens to be black. It is common of these people today to refuse to obey the law, then blame the cops for not allowing them to act like they do. Remember that it was she who was speeding in a school zone, then to refuse to give up her keys made her a public safety threat. She deserved what she got even though the thought of a pregnant woman being tasered is scary to me, she could have avoided it by cooperating with the police. I'm not pregnant and I would cooperate to avoid it. This is why I think she had other motives which makes her the lowest of the low since she was carrying another life within her.
1	**Which is true, [see above], but which is nothing to be ashamed of, since it applies to anyone, including myself, who feels motivated to debate philosophy. And although many darwinists kid themselves that they are here to debate 'science', they are not. They are here to defend their metaphysics and its place in their personal psychological identity, i.e., ego, against the metaphysics of others, just like everybody else.What is so very strange and unnatural, IMHO, about many materialist/mechanist/positivist/darwinist/atheists is that they will go to great lengths to deny that that is the worldview that their ego revolves around, and will always attempt to convince themselves and others that they are actually somebody else. Somebody utterly uninfluenced, psychologically, by any worldview, any metaphysic, any particular set of unconscious assumptions and prejudgements, at all. The rest of us are proud of the intellectual sub-strate upon which our opinions are based, be those opinions open to challenge or not. So why are materialist/mechanist/darwinists so often ashamed of being identified as such? Beats me.

0	you know what..you are right, any unwanted person should be killed. Lets start with nursing homes and then move on to mental health clinics. After that, we should kill all the poor people because they don't really help society that much. OH! and don't forget the handicapped...who would wanna live like that? Kill them...it is merciful...who cares what they want anyway, they don't know what they are saying. Then we will have a wonderful society :)
0	I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.
1	Well, we'll ignore the fact that you think dinos are the same as modern day reptiles, and we'll ignore the fact that you are assuming that what goes today must have gone before (something you rant against on a daily basis). Who said anything about reptiles or dinosaurs?
1	Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always.  In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves.  Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.
1	Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. "science" and "reality".
1	Just imagine if firearme safety was as heavily promoted in schools as sex education is. If we were to train children how to handle firearms, I feel confident that we could reduce accidental shootings, which the gun control crowds claim as one of their goals. No more of the  I thought it was unloaded  or  it just went off accidentally.  Ironically, I believe that federal gun-free school zones coupled with zero-tolerance policies make it nearly impossible for this to happen. Gun control could be costing children's lives. Or maybe it's just Darwinism in action.

1	And you know what? No amount of epigenetic change is going to turn a fruitfly embryo into a human. One of the reasons they are different, and subject to different epigenetic regimes, is because despite genetic homologies (which evolutionary theory predicts), their genomes are significantly different. They have some different genes, in different quantities, and in different arrangements, and that is critical. Epigenetics alone can't take one species and turn it into another, so far as anyone knows. It takes genomic restructuring, and that happens only through genetic mutation.

1	The stem cells that are used for such potentially life-saving procedures are at such an extremely early stage of development that there is no biological possibility that the beginnings of a mind exist. There is absolutely no feeling, no emotion, no thought, no sense of pain. The batch of cells is still an object. They are the very beginnings of the body where the beginnings of the mind (or, for that matter, a soul, if one is of the opinion that a soul must include some sense of mind) are very far off. However, unless I am mistaken in the biology of this particular batch of cells, they could potentially develop into an actual person (where, for me, person means not only body but some sense of mind or soul as well). This sense of potential personhood should not be taken lightly. This would not be a case of a woman's right over her own body. This would be the case of deliberately generating living human cells (note: this is not equal to a living person) for medical reasons benefiting a living person. In the balance of having some respect for the idea that these cells could potentially become a person (again, still far off from being actual people - i.e. starting to have a mind), I would only condone using such stem cells if it is a case of saving the life of an existing person - be it myself or anyone else. I would not, for example, condone use of stem cells to help alleviate a medical condition which is not life threatening.

1	In the theory of evolution, it all started with life. I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution. It's not. The word evolution means change. In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars "evolve" in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the "theory of evolution," it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest. Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant. One may postulate a magical, all powerful being that created the first life. The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time.
0	Why?Statistical testing cannot show something that is nonsensical to be either valid or invalid (prayer in this case)1. Why would god be random in his choices? If he is random, why bother praying in the first place?2. You could never actually verifiy that someone else somewhere in the world, or universe, wasn't praying for your control group, it simply couldn't be accurately tested.3. What are we testing anyway? Nothing supernatural can be tested rationally, it's by definition irrational.*4. OK, assume prayer is just "positive thought" whatever that means. Now, flip a coin 100 times and pray for heads every time. Statistical difference? no. How about write a quick random # generator to cycle through 10,000 coin flips and pray for heads every time. Find anything?*(If you really think you CAN show an entirely random system can be influence to be non-random through prayer alone, don't tell me, tell Randy for $1 MILLION dollars! PS. You cannot :/ )http://www.randi.org/==========================================unless:1. You are doing so for the joy of performing the action.2.

1	Well it gives us more indication as to the mode of life of Archaeopteryx as an early bird and more common structural features with small theropods that are suggested as the ancestral stock from which birds evolved. It is worth noting that both Velociraptor and Troodon lived a long time after Archaeopteryx; the suggestion here is all three had a common ancestor from which similar features were inherited.
1	if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will
1	Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution. Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all. He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited (but not all variability), he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others. From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so. To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal!  As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations .... Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth. Till then I will claim that such a transformation cannot be accomplished without alteration of the underlying genome. I am most dubious that you have any such example at hand.
1	You'll find that abortion targets none of these:  national, ethnical, racial or religious group(s).   Unwanted, unborn children is not a specific group. Nor are members of any group specifically targeted for abortion. The practice in open to all in the US.  Sorry. But all that shows is an abundant level of ignorance.  Now, if you can show that abortion is only used to cull the Romany populations in East Europe...then you may have a point.

0	You're saying that if we track the causes of these diseases back to their source its sugar. You are then saying that modern humans have adapted to a high sugar diet by having smaller skulls, because if you eat a very sugar rich diet over a prolonged period of time you will suffer from degenerative diseases that cause the brain to shrink. The next generation responds to their parents degenerative disease by being born with a smaller skull?
1	This is why arguments like  well, our population is out of control  never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying  Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!  I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better.
1	Well, there are some groups that say only some gun control, but they have a hidden agenda. The Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center, both favor complete prohibition of guns, even though they do not advocate it openly. Yes I believe in some gun control, but only that which is logical. If you make it illegal, it will just create a big black market, and we all know how that is. LA in California has a big black market thanks to gun control, still politicians here keep advocating more of the  useless  gun control. XXXXXX..

1	Looks like you're not asking for objections to the conclusions and analysis this time around, like you were here. I guess it is wise only to argue on the grounds you know your opponent will find the most irritating or difficult.At any R.A.T.E. (ha ha ha...), I'll repeat the objections raised on the old forum, which move to doubt the sufficiency of the empirical data:From http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq...1_1/Helium.htm:"Thus our new diffusion data support the main hypothesis of the RATE research initiative: that God drastically accelerated the decay rates of long half-life nuclei during the earth's recent past."The empirical data is missing, Zero. The problem with the empirical data in support of the above statement, is that it does not exist.

1	What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every "error" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted.
1	So you think that only the sentence structure needs to be examined and not the meaning of the words?  The courts have the legal authority to interpret the second amendment, not Journalism teachers. And I don't think that you can totally disregard what historians say. This is an matter in which fields of expertise overlap.
1	of course he says "might", science always tentative. any time you see something along the lines of "it happened this way" there is always an implied, but unseen "probably" between the "it" and the "happened".Look... you made a comment about how Dawkin's observation that the eye is flawed is actually support ID because it actually justifies a creationist's argument that it's ok to look for well designed aspects. I responded by putting your accusation in context (He was criticizing Paley, and he never actually used this as evidence, just showing that it could go both ways). Now you go off on a tangent about how dawkins’ logic is flawed, and how behe's logic is accurate... i don't want to get into that because, both dawkins’ and behe's make much better arguments themselves (anyone reading, go out and get these books… behe is much more technical and raises some questions that must be answered, however makes (imo) some unwarranted conclusions at the end of his book. Dawkins is much less technical, however provides logical reasoning as to why evolution is possible and how it works)but i do want to point out that while this is an example of 2 different interpretations (good/bad designs in the eye) given the same thing, it is NOT used as any kind of scientific proof of anything. opinions are not objective scientific evidence because they are subjective.
1	I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life.  This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.

0	Well said Jitobear. I couldn't agree more.
1	You can't accuse others of 'slight (sic) of hand' and then produce this! The same Home Office survey you linked to shows: 17% of total violent crime was 'common assault with NO injury' (i.e. pushing and shoving, spitting at someone or verbal abuse) 43% was 'common assault with less serious injury' (e.g, a scuffle outside a bar)20% were 'harrassment - no injuries suffered.5% were 'other violent crimes' including carrying a weapon.Only 2.1% of all violent crime led to a serious injury.The weapon most commonly used is, of course, the fist - in 78% of all cases. In order to make this comparison make any sense we need to know how the FBI defines violent crime.
1	Tell me, how does a link to a religious nut who thinks the New Testament was first written in Aremic , despite tons of evidence to the contrary, have anything to do with refuting the scientific theory of evolution?
1	Because both have different creation orders. Even if chapter 2 is 'specific' that doesn't even address the problem that the OP presented. Basically, what is the order of creation-chapter 1 or 2? Please justify your answer.
0	I think the same about religion. Why should you get your way and tryannise women, and I not get mine?
1	732,000 DIDN'T sign the petition. It seems only 5% of South Dakotans say "repeal the extreme abortion ban" and that is ASSUMING that all the signatures are valid. The good news for South Dakota is that come November they can show America how they really feel about abortion as opposed to having the courts decide laws.
0	Fair enough. Wonder why Archie refuses to admit this.  Favorite place? Did you even know how many posts I have there?  Btw, I see you did not respond to my other post. Especially the part where I cited many of us giving a dumb Muslim hell for his stupid beliefs.
1	And until they later contradict themselves their ruling is final, it doesn't matter if it's right or not, it's the way it is. The subject is closed, individual rights has won out, the duty to the state has been executed for charges of treason.
1	Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders.Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it.You don't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change. People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change.
1	So you define religion as the following:  1) Testable  2) Based on Experiments  3) Based on empirical evidence  4) Open to change based on experiments and new evidence  5) Validity based on facts, rather then Faith  If evolution is a religion, so is Chemistry.
1	Actually it is events like these that led the two most exhaustive studies ever done gun control to conclude this.   51 of the best gun control studies the WORLD had to offer
1	Actually, no they could not find oil without evolution. It's not only a matter of finding  certain rocks  associated with oil, but by reconstructing the paleo-environment. Only certain environments, indicated by types of rocks and the types of animals/plants that existed at that time, are suitable for the production of petroleum.  In fact, a lot of mineral resources are located by certain geologic formations as interpreted by modern theories of geology. Without a knowledge of biological and geological evolution prospectors would waste a lot of time looking in the wrong places.
0	Forest for the freakin' trees.So when heterosexual couples divorce, it's all automatic and assumed. Gay and straight people alike help foot the bill.Straight couples "have abso-freaking-lutely no qualms about forcing Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer to pony up more dough"...But when it comes to homosexual couples divorcing, it's only the gay individuals who "shell out more $$$".Can you explain why it's just for gays to help pay for the divorce of straight couples, but the same is not done for gays??? emoticonXEmbarrassed
1	While Huntard is correct in stating that all species considered to be human walked upright, there are some humans alive today who do not.  Misconduct claim fuels dispute among ?wrist-walker? researchers
0	And what is wrong with giving homosexuals the right to settle down with the person they love? What is it to you if a few limp-wrists get married in San Francisco? Homosexuals are people, too, who take out their garbage, pay their taxes, go to work, take care of their dogs, and what they do in their bedroom is none of your business.
1	In reverse? The scientific method begins with an observation. Then an hypothesis is proposed that will explain the observation. Then a prediction is made that must be true as a consequence, if the prediction is correct. Then methods are devised to test the prediction. What is described in the paper is the last step. Majerus already has his hypothesis and his prediction and is accumulating the data that will support them.
1	No. Evolution is a scientific study of the evidence of how life changes. Evolutionary theory offers falsifiable explanations of how that works. Creationism is religious in that it is based on no evidence. It is based on mythology.
0	Yes. It's part of this massive conspiracy. We're trying to thin out your population so we can take Australia for our own. emoticon_xgood
0	Just because a clump if cell will develope into a live human being doesn't mean the mother is obligated to let it happen in her body whether she want it to or not. If that bothers you then STOP DWELLING ON IT.
0	The pro-life position isn't even formost about the law. It is about stopping abortions, period. That is why so many pro-life people work in counseling centers, not legal offices. Your implication that pro-lifers do not vary in their views is just plain ridiculous--I myself am living proof that they do. I am certainly pro-life, but I don't oppose very early term abortions or when the life of the mother is in definite danger.
0	So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.
0	Your view of choice is your belief. I don't  believe  that a pregnant woman or anyone else should be able to choose for the child. That child does not have a choice. Choosing to kill someone is a choice, but it is not a choice that should be legal. Therefore, you are forcing your view of  choice  on me by making abortion (murder) illegal.
1	When I shooting pin and jug shoots it was common to have a thousand each of .45ACP, .44SPL and .40 S&W. Let us not forget the 3 unannounced visits per year from the boyos of Waco. At what time do you think they would be visiting? Working hours so the chance exists of no one home? Or in the dark of night to catch one asleep. What sort of visit do you expect. A polite knock on the door and wait for an answer? Or perhaps a crashing down of the door with a no knock entry? Thanks but no thanks.
1	I did not say that I agree with a tax incline, and perhaps that is a discussion for a different time. However there is a difference that I should point out. There is a reason for the tax incline: those with little money will suffer a lot more if they have to pay hijgher taxes. Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living. Is it equal? Interestingly it could be viewed as an attempt to give everyone a more equal income, however it could also be viewed as an inequality involving one group of people paying lots of taxes and another group paying not as much. I won't debate whether it is the type of equality we want to promote, I'll just assume that a tax incline removes equality. But remember, there is a reason behind that tax incline. The goal of government is to promote happiness as much as possible. In this case, the government could be viewed as sacrificing equality in favor of happiness. But whether that tradeoff is really working or is really a good idea is all up for debate. The point is: there is reasoning behind a tax incline based on income. There is no good reason behind giving marriage benefits to people based on their sex and there are plenty of reasons to do just the opposite. Or at least it is my goal to prove that in these posts.
0	No one, I repeat no one wants to take punitive actions against any woman unless you call carrying the baby to term punitive action.........  All we want is for the baby in the womb to have the same chance you did if possible...........
1	the entire creation argument is a load of pure, undiluted ********.  People like Peddler are perfect examples. If evolution is wrong, therefore creation is right in their logic. When was the last time you saw a creationist explain their belief without attacking evolution?  NEVER.  Creationists cannot defend their beliefs because their beliefs are based on known lies.
0	Is it only religious people who insite violence and hatred toward gays? NO!  You're attempting, weakly at that, to jump on the Frist-train by saying hes persecuting religious people. As if religious people are being singled out.
1	Then I'd like to see your definition of the scientific method. As I recall, the scientific method is purely secular.  What evidence of God? Please, show me such evidence. There is no evidence of God. God is of the supernatural, you cannot prove the supernatural with evidence from the natural! God cannot be proven, nor can it be disproven. There is no evidence of God, and there is no evidence that there is no unorthodox God.
1	Well, I'm not sure the principles of physics and such would be any different - surely God could make them the way they are now and suspend them at will.  That said, it seems reasonable, from a biological/geological perspective, that the following observations would be made:  1. There would be a single mass extinction event for ALL flora and fauna, not numerous, asynchronous extinctions in differing environments encompassing particular groups of creatures  2. This mass extinction would coincide with a single, large, relatively uniform stratum of a more or less heterogeneous composition, or perhaps a very few strata still with the same basic property, not numerous discontinuous strata  3. there would be numerous complete fossils of all creatures living at the time, to include soft-bodied creatures (since rapid burial followed by fossilization is much more likely to preserve soft tissues either via imprints or actual fossilization)  4. the complete fossils should all be found in contemporaneous strata, i.e., human fossils should be found in the same layers as dinosaurs  5. The biological species concept should be very simple to define, as all living (and extinct) creatures would be, first of all, much less diverse, and each 'kind' would be simple to classify  6. there would be no reason to find, or even to expect to find, a unity of basic forms or functions or genomic content in extant creatures (e.g., no 'universal' genetic code, mammals with more or less than 4 limbs, etc.)  Well, that is a few off the top of my head...

0	Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.  (Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)
0	Because nobody could be anymore fraudulent than your own Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center, right?Simply because you call our sources frauds doesn't mean they are, Brady. They're accurate whether you like them or not. Meanwhile the VPC is slowly dying off, losing more and more members each day, and slipping into obscurity.
1	Actually the room, straps, and table are all multi-use. And the drugs only cost Texas $86.08 per execution as of 2002.
1	Only a handful of the 300+ million people that live in America actively participate in the use of illegal drugs. Blaming all of America for their desire to break the laws and throw away money is dishonest.  Stop blaming gun owners for the problems in Mexico. You obviously hate this country so much, move out and go over to Britain.
1	Have you read the Old Testament? In Numbers, God says don't count any male child under one month old as a person. They also didn't count girls at all. He also had them burn Tamora while she was pregnant.
0	Have you ever had an abortion?
1	Fossils show inherited change. Adaptation does not.
1	Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.
1	I didn't think they would have the guts after getting slapped so badly last time out. I mean, there is loosing a case, and then there is getting kicked up and down the street and dragged through a field of tacks, which is pretty much happened when last time out.
1	Sure, that's what you believe. But the Constitution is what this country is founded on, so naturally laws should reflect it. If you personally choose to live your life in accordance to the bible, that's fine. But the Bible, like many other foreign documents, has no place in politics. Religious influence in government is highly un-American.
0	The issue is about you linking an incident where a pregnant woman had so little regard for her unborn baby that she picked a fight with the police and somehow use it to demonise the police and the pro life people.I could not imagine anyone could be stupid enough to do this without the aid of strong drink but thank you for reminding me that you can do it easily.
0	So there's no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser-of-two-evils to you? You're using the fact Palin is there to avoid needing to take Biden to task for HIS statements. If, hypothetically speaking, Palin wasn't there at all and Biden had made the statement alone in a stump speech, you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position???Frankly, if he's the candidate you feel best supports gay rights, I would think this statement on his part would be MORE alarming, and all the MORE cause for concern. 
1	I think the reason for the law would be that there's no reeason to have the ban in the first place (ok, no GOOD reason).
1	You might want to pick up a history book and read it. Try reading both the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers for starters. If you were familiar with them, then you would've already had the answer to your first question.Your selective memory is at work again. As I recall, in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians. Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied, at first, by the government. Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops. In the end, the 'open and shut case' the government thought they had, blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses. I also recall, at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York, I think it was. There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton, I believe. There are a few other instances I'm sure.I note your glee about secret agencies and their awesome firepower in which mere citizens would be defenseless against. Is your closet full of brown shirts? You must be proud.Huh? You're for protecting yourself against other citizens as long as it doesn't involve guns? Of course, that wouldn't apply to the criminal that you're protecting yourself against! Why don't you read how well your gun bans are working in other countries? Regulation? The only regulation should be mandatory firearms training for all citizens like in Switzerland. Not the 'regulation' that you liberals would propose which, of course, always leads to an outright ban of private ownership. Why do you fear the 'people'?It doesn't matter what you think, the second amendment is clear enough all by itself. Try reading the Constitution again.
1	Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?  And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference.
1	Yes. It is also a classic example of a creationist straw man. It demonstrates that you haven't bothered to learn the most basic ideas of the topic and that you are willing to let some creationist hack dupe you. The methods of dating fossils was first developed by creationists when they discovered that certain suites of fossils were always found in the same order in geological strata. They reasoned that the deeper the fossils were, the older they were. Thus, they assigned relative ages to certain types of strata. Of course, their estimates of actual age were way off, since they thought that the earth was only a few million years old. We now have several methods of radiometric dating and can more accurately determine the ages of fossils. The relative dating methods of the creationist scientists has been confirmed - the dates are just older than they thought.
1	It's not indoctrination, it's a don't touch campaign. The Eddie Eagle program doesn't even advocate gun opinions, but dogmatic gun grabbers like you would oppose the NRA if they were trying to make world peace and feed starving kids in Africa.
0	As far as I'm aware your aim is for abortion not to happen, my point is that despite making it illegal it will still happen -- making it illegal is not achieving your aim.  Hence my point is sound, and as such it is a good point.
1	Well, Google is your friend here emoticon_idea - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.  It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as "one bi
0	Wez it doesn't matter whether they are legal or not. You can still get them. If keeping them illegal has worked at all I would say go for it, but it hasn't. If I want a drug I can get a drug in about an hour. The same goes for any of you.

1	People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things.

I know where most people stand on these boards but you like a typical lunatic fringe liberal keep your agenda under wraps...
0	She should not have the baby in the first place, and thats what im saying. The only irresponsible move a 12 year old would be making is not having an abortion, as she is not physically and emotionally capable of raising or bearing a child.
0	I'm not discounting secular organizations. I'm discounting atheists. They **** and moan about the wicked Christians trying to run their lives but don't pony up when others need help. Christians lend a hand in spite of all their supposed wickedness, but atheists are typically a bunch of cheap windbags. They speak of  intrinsic morality  not being religious-based, but don't display an ounce of it when push comes to shove.
0	So conservatives can give shout their brand of lies as the truth but a liberal who calls them on it isn't being tolerant?
0	And who is the 'WE' that we trust? The scientists or the theologians, who disagree with each other?  I am curious for it on my own account.. and not willing just to accept someone's authority saying it happened one way or another.
0	If the justification for morality is obedience to a divine authority, it has no place in a public school. Those without religious beliefs are not by definition immoral.
1	Read the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
1	That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky. They way our justice system works is: 1) crime is commited 2) suspects are considered 3) evidence against one suspect builds and is arrested 4) suspect is given a fair trial with all the evidence present to a judge and jurry.In our system of justice, collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause. There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence. Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment. This collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission. The crime fighting tool you just described violates 2 rights in one sweep. That is a very scary power given to police.
0	It is worse then that they just don't get it. Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. They just don't get it.
1	That has nothing to do with acknowledging or not acknowledging facts.
0	So, whenever anyone tells you something you don't want to believe, they are lying atheists. How far do you think that attitude is going to get you in life? And what about Christians who accept evolution? Are they lying? What about Christians who do scientific research that confirms evolution? Are they lying? To go back to the first statement I quoted, when you dismiss all the evidence we bring up as lies, how are we supposed to convince you of anything? Or is this just a one-way street? It is our duty to be convinced by you?To me:
0	Can cause aggression, does not mean that it will though. Alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that. So do women but we arent going to ban them now are we, Sorry but I was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in.
0	I'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn't even believe in what they're selling. Those teachers may teach it, but they don't believe  in it.
1	And you can of course consult the actual paper referenced by the press release. It can be found (later) at the following reference. The work in pure evolution in its orientation.  Whittall, Justen B. and Scott A. Hodges. 2007. Pollinator shifts drive   increasingly long nectar spurs in columbine flowers. Nature,   in press.
1	So does the 2 day before birth unborn child because it is in the third trimester. I as in what you have come to know as ME was born somewhere in the third trimester. The body that I'm sitting in this chair with and typing this with was born at conception, and started as a sperm before conception.
0	Like they said in the article, you can have a campaign against marrige because it hurts women because of domestic abusers, you can say the baseball hurts men, because many of them get hurt. But most of the time its a great thing. Why then, would you suggest something so abusrd as to abortion hurts women. Most of the time, abortion lets women let go of that big weight thats holding them back and prusue their dreams, and live a happy life. Since when has AntiAbortionists cared about women? Can someone fill me in here?
0	Justice?  Equality?  I realize that people who  don't recognize gay marriage  often don't have those things in mind when it comes to gays, but those would be the reasons...
1	Well, there's plenty of scientific evidence about fetal development, such that we can confidently say no "person" is established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy.I think the decision should be up to the woman, as under U.S. law. Between her and her doctor, whoever else she freely chooses to share with. I think, at some point, in a normally developing pregnancy, a very fuzzy looking line is crossed. But that's why we have state regulations during the third trimester.IMO, Latin American countries, until this day, are unduly under the influence of the Church, superstition and ignorance.
1	So Bloomberg is suggesting that the ATF should seek to prosecute anyone and everyone, evidence or not.This isn't how law enforcement works. This isn't how the Constitution works. You can't be prosecuted for a crime that you didn't commit, and for which there is no evidence to link you to it. But that's not good enough for Bloomberg, oh no. Bloomberg wants to ATF to view anyone attending a gun show as absolutely guilty, and subject to arrest, detainment and prosecution without evidence or witnesses, thus violating a person's Sixth Amendment rights.And as I said before. Bloomberg makes absolutely no recommendation for what to do with these 35, supposedly, criminals sellers. He didn't want them charged with felonies, he didn't file civil suits against them, he didn't do anything. He just got the "evidence" he wanted and then he let them go scot free as if they'd done nothing. Obviously New York City style catch and release justice at its absolute finest.Also note how the report refers to the SKS as "assault rifles". There's not a single feature on the SKS that would qualify it as either as "assault rifle" or an "assault weapon".
0	Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce.
1	And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said,  There can be no liberty without virtue.  Someone else once said,  Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings .  If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 -  The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur.
0	Thanks for clearing that up Mutz. I've always known that putting every living species on the earth in one boat is a heckuva lot easier to believe than those foolish fossils. I'm just gald someone else said it.
1	The claim that the gun buy-back in Australia caused the crime rate to increase has been refuted as an urban legend. http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/ausguns.htm  The people that make this claim are either ignorant or intentionally trying to mislead people. The same with the UK. From reading grayhawk and DHard3006's posts it appears that they get most of their information (or misinformation) from pro-gun websites. Do a little bit of research on your own.
1	Oh yes, of course. But thatÂ’s assuming that the unfit populations actually survive long enough to breed. On the average, fit populations of a specie breed more than unfit populations of the same specie.

1	I Believe that the world will reach a certain heat, (warm enough to melt enough ice to stop the gulf stream) at which point the UK and Europe will dramatically cool to a more siberian temp. If Anyone who reads this has seen the film  the day after Tomorrow you may think im this science fixtion. However after researching on the possibility i discovered that if enough fresh water were to flow south to the Gulf Stream it would be cut off sue to the different densities and such.  Any Comments?
0	Well, as we can see from other recent posts, your reading comprehension is below high school level.  I don't get it. Why do folks think lying enhances their POV?
1	The 10 commandments are a real time story, told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to... Moses.  Genesis, is a history lesson, told by a man who had no understanding of modern science, or the language to describe it in that fashion... Moses.  If God chose to reveal to you in some special way, the origins of the universe, for you to write down for generations to come.. you would write a different story than Moses. Just as one person views art differently from another person.  I see no duplicity between the two.
1	How are we now able to observe the orbit of Pluto, when the orbit of Pluto supposely takes 249 years? It was only discovered in 1930. According to your logic, any claims that Pluto orbits the sun is pure speculation and will be until 2179.By the way, we observe evolution all the time. You see, the threory of evolution has to do with how living organisms change through time, not with how the world came about. We have observed the bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics all the time. It is becoming a real problem in that there are some bacteria that are immune to almost every antibiotic we have.
1	Cahuella,  The Crusades (for the most part) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression. If you would like to see a recent discussion of this then go to the  Compromise  thread on this forum and see what Simone and I discussed.  As to the sperm and egg being a thing very similar to a fertilized egg..I think that may be a bit of a simplification.  As to the Church making fair decisions, I believe it does. That's why it distinguishes an order of morality with degrees of goodness and badness. That's why a war may be permissable but an abortion is not.  Parcum, glad to see you back. I was wondering where you had gone.
1	I watched the program and managed to keep the television switched on despite the distractions from irrelevant images, loud hymn singing, and the editing of Dawkins' contribution - which made him look like a 'mad scientist'.The claim that Intelligent Design is a novel idea sprung full-armed from the heads of American religious enthusiasts is wrong. What is now loosely called the 'design argument' has been known to philosophers for at least two centuries as an a posteriori argument (literally, 'from backwards'). It is examined at length and dismissed by Hume in his 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion' published in 1779.
0	Go pound sand. You're the people who want the Separation of Church and State, remember? Get your sick, satanic mits off the church.
1	I don't see a huge difference. The same methodology science used to come up with sonograms and amniocentesis was used to come up with evolution. After all, both sonic imaging and amniocentesis are theories.
0	Oh, is THAT where you are getting your anti-evolution information: The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book dealing with biology that was written not by a biologist, but by an engineer...right? Walter James ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And gee whiz, biologists don't agree with ReMine ... how strange! :-)  PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine himself when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.
0	And how many murderers have got away with it because they lured their victim to their home? And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing. I'm glad I live in a civilised country where the aim is to avoid people getting killed.
1	I have posted responses to Demon38’s earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light. 
1	I think you may have missed this part of the article.  It is the law, and our state's Constitutions. All we Americans ask is for everyone to Obey the Law! I think even you would have to agree with that statement.
1	That isn't the arguement your buddy made. He claimed guns could be controlled by dogs and snakes and stuff like that.Do you have any examples of dogs or snakes controlling drugs and going on rampages and blowing folks heads off? Even claimed the dog was mournful for his bereaved master. He didn't mention how the snake felt emoticonXSmilieAlso said something about robots and guns but didn't have any examples to wow us with. Do you?
1	There's much more to it than that. There are several different kinds of genetic changes that are called mutations. Evolution is not limited to the effects of point mutations alone. Why don't you demonstrate your competence to discuss this topic by defining a point mutation, and then name and define several other kinds of mutation.And, of course, there are other mechanisms that increase the genetic variability in any population besides mutation. On the other hand, there are mechanisms that tend to reduce the variability in a population in addition to natural selection. Please name and explain at least 4 others in order that you do not continue to look like a fool.
0	I don't agree with this debate. If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. Why would that be?
0	I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, "And the truth shall set you free"!!! 
1	Well, then I'd have to convert everest to kilometers. I live in the US. Metric is alien. haahh.
1	Since I was there, I'll give you an objective rundown:1.) Dawkins didn't "crash" anything. He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q&A session with the producer at the end --a session that the producer deliberately started.2.) There was no "sneaking" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.This all begs the question: What in God's name are they so bloody afraid of?

1	So, what you're saying is we shouldn't look at evidence and refine our methods and calculations when more accurate data allows for more accurate outcomes? We should just make a statement once, and stick to that, no matter what reality shows us?As to your 10 billion year "gap" which turned out to be not a gap but a differece that came about by using different data sets to calculate the age, first of all, why is this a problem, second of all, have you heard of the WMAP project? It returned a highly accurate age for the universe.
1	Yes, I think so. Why do you ask?  It isn`t. Its 2,0% (est. 2003)...  They do. The appointments in the judicial branch are either political (by a democraticly elected government) or based on merit. The legislative branch is elected through popular elections and the executive branch (the government) is in turn elected by the parliament  Nope. Denmarks political system is based on parliamentarism. The executive power rests in the prime minister, not the monarch (who lacks political power).  Nope, judges are either appointed by democraticly elected governments or hired on merit (depending on what facet of the judicial branch you are talking about).  Well, I`ve always seen denmark to have a rather high level of political, economic, social and religous freedom (the only real detriment is high taxes, but some would argue that high taxes coupled with a large amount of income distribution actualy increases economic freedom, so its kind of ambigous). This being mixed with relative socialistic and prosperous economy makes Denmark a good contestant for the title  the land of the free .
0	Much used and abused argument. Can't really be proven or disproven until it is tested, so I am not sure there is an argument. This is dramaticized by Hollywood leftists in movies and TV, so it has become this seemingly powerful point. Still not seeing where millions of children should be punished for the likely much fewer women who will seek abortion if it is made illegal.

1	I have yet to see any conclusive evidence that this is true and undeniable.  You wanna prove in an undeniable manner that developed nations around the world have fewer deaths than America? Then get cracking and gather the evidence. Start proving that the various governments around the world aren't lying about their annual death rates. The UK has been found guilty of continuously altering statistics to make themselves look safer than they really are.  So do you have any proof that the annual number of deaths of a country like Germany, are the true number and not some government sponsored, people's friendly statement to make people feel less afraid?
1	Note that at the very beginning it said "allegations", as in alleged. Alleged isn't the same thing as hard and provable evidence. So this is nothing more than supposition, theory, hearsay, musings, etc.  Come back when you've got some hard evidence!

1	Sinjin this appears to be a typically Liberal response to a man who is clearly in trouble. Have you or any of your family ever had to sit with a shotgun on your lap when you should have been peacefully sleeping? The man went to the ball game but was not allowed to return to his home. And for what reasoning? It is his home for goodness sake.  The article is rampant with I feared for my life, I am being harassed, I fear for my family, and the police don't care. That is what struck me when I read this! I was horrified for them just reading it, because I too was in that exact same position once.
1	Again, name one that is presented in high school. In fact, name several since you seem to think that there are several. And it really doesn't matter how many times you squeal about how you aren't talking about YEC, you are. You have been duped and you didn't even know it was going on.

Why did they pay a panal of 27 scientists and science educators to write science standards, and then throw them out?

1	Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two.
1	Walking-fish:  I basically agree with you. I guess I was being redundant in this regard. I was thinking out loud, in cyberspace. But it is interesting that we humans may be the first species to actually go beyond the need for this death &amp; reproduction cycle by genetically or artificially reinventing ourselves. But now I'm thinking out loud again on the web.
1	So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?Wouldn't it just be easier, as well as more likely, for an emotionally disturbed student to just illegally bring a gun to school and kill their teacher, rather than waiting for a legal alternative to commit murder and go to prison anyway?
0	Thanks. I guess I need you to clarify your question a bit - what does "it" in your question refer to? There are two things that I can think that the word might refer to (how I felt about the abortion, or how I felt about adoption are the two possibilities), so I'll need you to expand on that for me to give you a good answer. ;)

1	As pointed out, with a different physics, chemistry and biology, the universe as we know it wouldn't exist. What is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today. One problem with creationism (I know, you want to ignore the problems) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events.I don't mean to rain on the parade, but with all that said, it has been done. There is a list of 28 items, originally compiled by Jim Moore, that we should find if the flood happened as per the Bible. Not even miracles can solve these. That list is followed by further problems that have been compiled by Ken Harding from numerous sources.What Would We Expect to Find if the World Had FloodedFor more information you can refer to the Flood Geology FAQs at TO. Two items with information that specifically addresses the question of the OP are Problems with a Global Flood, and The Geologic Column and its Implications for the Flood .

1	While we're on the subject, I've managed to conclusively disprove Intelligent (sic) Design. It's actually a remarkably simple thing to do when you realise that Nature is just far too complex to have been designed.  Look around you. We humans are perhaps the best designers that we know of. Look how crude are the things we make: the filthy, inefficient combustion engine; the computer, unable to make decisions of its own and unable to feel emotions; the microwave, unable to cool anything like a tasty meal. We are, at best, crude emulators of Nature.  No. No designer could possibly have kept track of all the interlocking wonders of the natural world, therefore there can't possibly have been one.  Also, the chances of a designer appearing ab initio in the Universe are of the order 1 in 5x10^90871. I worked it out.  I'll let the Discovery Institute know.
1	Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that.  Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states.  And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.

1	And you're perfectly entitled to believe that, so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species, which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning, just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional. Just like all the other hominid fossils.Are you starting to see my point yet? You're trying to claim that because Lucy isn't conclusive proof, she means nothing. That's fallacious reasoning: Lucy contributes to the accumulated evidence supporting common descent. I don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.

1	But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. And pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do. My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction.

0	Without a regular supply of naive, incoherent, or asinine posters prepared to deny even the most well established scientific hypotheses, laws of physics, etc., other interested parties (e.g. the casual readers) would not get a chance to how scientific method and rational arguments are deployed to answer and refute nonsense. For this reason, the  fruit and nutters  should not be completely discouraged.
1	actually, proof of something comes down to 2 things: agreeing on what the definition of the thing is, and agreeing on evidence that verifies the thingwind is defined as movement of air. air moves, therefore wind exists. this has been proven. i dont know what kind of definition you used, but it doesnt seem like your assignment is that difficult.God, on the other hand, is elusive even at the definition stage. he is sometimes defined as creator of the world, a higher force, all-powerful, greatest being possible, love, etc...unless a definition is agreed upon, even beginning to prove existance is difficult. suppose we define God as love. love exists, therefore God exists. however, not everybody agrees to this definition. suppose we define God as creator of the universe. sciences states the the universe was created spontaneously, therefore God doesnt exist. therefore, for some, either this definition is not satisfactory or the conclusion of the scientists isnt satisfactory.finding proof for the existence of God becomes increasingly difficult when Gods definition gets constantly revised and adjusted. if we could simply agree on the definition for God then we could begin to find a proof.
1	But, it is a new TYPE of butterfly.   It would be more like if a bonobo and a human had a child. That is theorotically possible...
1	End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.  First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htm  The more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.html  These documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.
1	The point of this debate is not what is human, but what is a human being, a person. To some the clothes (DNA) make the man, and to others the man (Mind) makes the clothes.
1	Yes, that does seem to be the primary concern, and it does seem to be that the the cost of the program could be considerable. However, I do ask again that you at least consdier the following, presented by the Center for Gun Policy and Research, part of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. (Link on an above post.)...the costs of creating, maintaining, and using a federal system are likely to be substantial. The projected costs of the system must be weighed against the potential to reduce the enormous social and economic costs associated with gun violence. Eighty lives per day—almost 29,000 per year—are lost to gun violence in the United States.16 The social costs of gun violence in the United States have been estimated to be an extraordinary $100 billion per year.17 If ballistic fingerprinting laws result in significant reductions in gun violence— by strengthening law enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violent offenders and deterring illegal gun use by and transfers to criminals and youth—the investment will be well worth it.Also,-In 1994, the lifetime medical costs associated with firearm injuries and deaths totaled $2.3 billion.- Approximately 49% of the costs of gun-related injuries and deaths is paid by the public.-The hospitalization costs associated with firearm-related injuries in 1997 exceeded $800 million.-Thirty percent (30%) of hospitalized patients were uninsured, and an additional 30% were enrolled in government health insurance programs.-The direct costs (e.g., medical, productivity) and social costs (e.g., quality of life, emotional) of gun violence are an estimated $100 billion per yearLike I have, said, it seems that perhaps not enough research has been done, to figure out precisely what the program will cost, and how how effective it would be. But I am suprised that there are those who seem so set against even considering such a program, when it appears that there may be a substantial benefit.

1	Yes. The first one isolated was a frame-shift mutation on a plasmid. A fairly common source of useful mutations in bacteria.
1	**As above, 'social classes' are 'populations', and modern darwinian evolution focuses entirely on the 'evolution' of 'populations', NOT individual organisms. Neo-Lamarkian theory focuses on individual, internally driven effort, instead of inherited advantage, which is the be-all and end-all of Darwinism, and of modern economic and political social theory. Just as it has always been.
0	And you think this a good thing? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist.
1	How many discoveries in modern biology that now saves lives were discovered as a result of bible study?  Take your pick, do you want to die young and religious or embrace science and die at a ripe old age?  The religious all live and rely on things that only science could provide while constantly arguing angst it.  Personally I think the religious that do that should be restricted to receive only 17th century medicine so we can remove the blockage to progress they present.
1	It's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you don't even know what it is, but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly. If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion, "God did it!" without any specifics as to how, then you have answered no questions and explained nothing. Such empty assertions cannot be proven wrong. Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God, and that is what scientists study. There are lots of scientists, evolutionary biologists among them, who believe in a Creator God.Science is not a matter of proving something right. Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed. In science, the facts are the observations. The process of science is a process of testing those theories, again and again. The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong. The more a theory has been tested, the more secure it is, even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic. How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun? Is that a fact? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons?Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are "proven" they will grow up to be facts? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and "God did it" offers no predictions.However, if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events, you have made assertions that can be checked. For example, if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that. But clearly there are. And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that. For example, SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth. It's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method. It is 170,000 light years away. In other words, SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago. A creationist's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth, complete with the history of an explosion that never happened. Ultimately, creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence.So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology, great! But if you wish to argue science, then shouldn't you at least learn what it is? If you claim that a theory is wrong shouldn't you at least know what that theory is?By the way, I am getting the definition of evolution from memory. I have been using it for many years. It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago. Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class. Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition. It is common knowledge - and that's why I ask, if you don't know what evolution is, how do you know that you are opposed to it?

1	Well, I just don't see this. It's an observable fact that species produce far more progeny than can possibly hope to survive. Consequently, the grim reaper will take most of them before they can breed -- which is NS in action. There is absolutely nothing implausible about variation being random, with only those variants that are compatible with environmental conditions having a chance of success. The rest you just wouldn't see.

1	I learned a few things from the post. The author claimed "most households don’t have guns". According to 1997 stats, 25% of ALL US adults owned firearms. If you assume that there are typically two adults per household, that means 50% of households have guns, so the statement is false.On a personal note, someone tried to break into my brother's apartment shortly after he was married. He quickly opened the door, yelled "freeze MFer or I'll XXXX your head off!" while holding a short-barrelled shotgun and watched the perp #### himself. being half asleep and in possession of a slightly modified shotgun, my brother didn't call the cops to report this self-defensive use of a firearm.
1	And if they do? Is that as big a crime as an ID advocate making his case in a science classroom? The fact is, the influence of evangelical atheists canÂ’t be kept out of the science classroom, because no consensus exists on just where the fact/philosophical line is drawn. If a teacher or a textbook cross the line in the slightest way, time consuming distracting religious/non religious discussions can follow.

If law-abiding gun owners were overwhelming those who should not have access to guns, those who use guns unlawfully, I would be very pleased.But, as far as I can see, the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun, no matter how insane, no matter how stupid, no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death.

0	Well here is a christian who supports abortion.I personally HAVE had an abortion. I had it several years, and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision, I chose what was best for me. I was engaged (now married), and both my then-fiance and I were on birth control (I was on the pill and he used condoms). Unfortunately, despite those precautions, I became pregnant. We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child.I think this is one of the many circumstances in which abortion is absolutely justifiable, especially because I think that except for rare circumstances, abortion should be allowed up to the third trimester (the exceptions would be if the woman's life was in danger, etc. for a later abortion).As to God not supporting abortion? Rubbish. If you'd like I could give you verses in which he not only supported abortions, but ordered forced abortions through his people (that is if you take the OT as literally true)
1	Simone, I salute you in knowing what a Jesuit is. Have you read the article I supplied (keeping in mind that it is written by a Protestant researcher who is not a Jesuit)? Can you refute its points?
1	the problem with a "un-genesis style" creation is that it would effectively nullify everything in the bible. the biblical god both created life on earth in 6 days and sent his son to die for the sins of humankind. to me there is something very wrong with blatantly rejecting one biblical claim and blindly embracing anotherthe god in this context (one that created the world some other way, and may not necessarily disapprove gays) may also not care about your ethical code. then such a god's existence should have no bearing on how we live our lives, now would it?if such a god requires us to be ethical, is not against homosexuality, and created the world in a way other than genesis' description, then you are talking about a god of specific characteristics that would lend itself to a precise definition. we would require a lengthy list of rules by which we should live, and a description of how the world was actually created, as well as historical references of god's interaction with mankind in times past. you'd end up with another bible

1	Million year old moths didn't have the same capabilities as a present day moths. Million year old moths had capabilities that suited it to the million year old environment. Changes to moths have been subtle because it is a successful group of organisms, but changes do exist. Also, you keep harking on brains making creatures adaptive. An ant has a brain, yet an ant follows a very predictable program that can be quite easily simulated by computers. Of course there is always a randomizaion factor, but you mustn't confuse random action with adaptation.

And yes, we could very well debate potentials, but that is a different branch of the bigger picture and personally I don't see a reason to go down it, at least not at this point.
1	I think you just made the point that they're people after a certain degree of development takes place.
1	No, that isn't what I mean at all. But leave it you guy's to once again misinterpret what I did mean. You consistently lose all credibility when you defend and even fight to support lies and deceit.
0	In your analogy I would say they are confusing too. I don't smoke however it is not because I am against smoking it is because I don't wanna do it eventhough I don't think it is "wrong". This is a far cry from saying you think something is wrong yet support others doing it if they want to.
1	And what does he mean by that? You apparently don't have a clue. Tell me, do you have any idea what "secondary cause" is?
0	sounds good.
0	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it. I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.
0	No one, I repeat no one wants to take punitive actions against any woman unless you call carrying the baby to term punitive action.........  All we want is for the baby in the womb to have the same chance you did if possible...........
1	Actually it is. All the countries with public healthcare systems rank higher than the U.S. We are number 37. I thought we already went through this.  Every scarce resource is rationed in every system. For example healthcare is rationed for the uninsured, the uninsurable, the dropped ones.
0	oh ye of little faith..... i pity you
0	Why is that? Because you disagree with them?
0	Anti-gunners don't care. They want ALL the guns not matter what is historically correct. Men who lived during the birth of this country were made of a much different metal than liberal anti-gunners today. What once considered a persons responsibility and own personal domain has been superceeded for  collective good  and what is  benefit to society . Never mind that democracy is fragile and that the majority of all living humans past and present has lived not as free men. Never mind that that those lessons and hard won freedoms are traded away for the convience of state care and protection. Yes horrific crimes are commited with firearms, but they are commited by evil men. Good and evil can be equally acomplished by a firearm. Never mind that evil men commit evil acts and good men can do good with the same firearm. What matters most to anti-gunners is that the evil and the good should be punished together for the common good of society.
1	College. They are normally studied for two years between the ages of 16 and 18 before going to uni.
1	Let's not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it's evolution; he's saying that "evolutionists" say that it's evolution. It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity.

1	Actually it has been prosecuted under 42 UDC 1981 and 1986. It dates back to the first Civil Rights ruling in , oh, about 1866 but I would have to check the date to be certain. That is one reason Thomas and Stevens felt it was incorporated under the P or I clause.What is your point about the rifle comment? Did it just sound cool so you threw that out there for the cats? :)
0	I have never said anything about not defending it through armed force. I just don`t believe that you need an armed populace.
0	I find it difficult to believe that one would be banned from this site simply for not learning about evolution. There must be something else involved here.  Either someone is joking with you about having you banned or you're not telling us the whole story.  Now if there's a move to ban you for incessant challenges of things that have been clearly explained over and over and over, there may be grounds for extraction.  I'd like to read the whole story.  Will the real moderator please stand up?
0	And so on. Yes. a lie generated by creationist liars is what you use as source for what scientists are claimed to adhere to? Your dishonesty is actually rather startling. This is the worst attempt at dishonesty I have seen from lying creationists yet, and your gleeful introduction of that lie shows how truly and completely dishonest you are. Would you stop your lies. You are pathetic.
1	I know what you mean. I also wonder how they think their children or grandchildren will be paying for their medical bills.Note, by way of comparison, this Pittsburgh local t.v. clip of the September 20th March for Jobs (part of Healthcare Justice Week, this week). See how clearly and intelligently the protesters articulate their objectives, and without the disgraceful display of blind malice we have otherwise witnessed from the teabaggers:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkUxvX5JNJg

1	You just had to bring Godwin into didn't you. >_>  Besides what good is a corpse? Nevermind you're never going to understand my logic so I might as well not waste the time.
1	That was put nicely. No argument here. Maybe marriage should be taken out and give everyone civil unions. And if you wanted to be considered married it can be your religious ceremony

1	For the final compilation, yes, but the vast majority, certainly the Gospels and the first few Pauline epistles, were widely accepted long before that, and were regarded as authoritative in the early 2nd century. By all means quibble about 2 Peter, Hebrews and Revelation but don't try to claim the books of the Bible were selected politically in the 4th century, it simply doesn't fit the facts.
1	Greater legal minds than yours or mine see laws against same-sex marriage as unconstitutional "limiting". Quibble with them if you want, but that's how they put it.
1	Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells "tuned" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can "figure out" what wavelength is entering our eyes.http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htmDoes this dispell your confusion?Edit:And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye.
1	No, they're not.
1	Can you read? You linked to a site that is essentially a bibliography. The title is "Feminism AND Science." Did you intend to mislead?
1	Actually they are what make us animals. It's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human.  There is no precise definition as to what it is that makes someone a person. An in-fetu fetus are not a person IMO even though they may well have a brain, nervous system and organs.
1	This judge stated that it was UN-Constitutional (according to California Constitution) to limit marriage to opposite-gender couples.  So . . . . . why did we vote in 2000 on the definition of marriage? And since the majority stated that marriage was between one man and one woman - why was that not taken into consideration with this ruling?  Why is it that when the people speak their voice, it is IGNORED?? Not only the mayor of SF - but this Superior Court judge as well?
1	In that case it would be not registering your guns which would lead to confiscation rather than registering your guns. The logic of your argument seems questionable. It would be like arguing- "It's the outright truth that property taxes lead to confiscation because if you don't pay them the government can take your property." Would anybody seriously think that that is a good argument against property taxes? 
1	Technically, all syllogisms need two premises, first of all.   Step two  and  step three  were a dilemma, not separate steps. Learn to read.  Dilemma:  You only read Scenario 1, which was:  step two -God can create a rock he cannot lift -  Step three - God cannot lift the rock  conclusion - God is not all powerful  Scenario Two was  - God cannot create such a rock  - Therefore, there is something God cannot do  - Therefore, God is not all-powerful  The only case in which God could truly be all-powerful is if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it, which defies the Law of Non Contradiction and is thus absurd. Thus, the notion of all-powerfulness, which leads to such a notion, is also absurd.
0	Didn't I just say it is dumb to compare the two?
1	But do you think that more assumptions is more likely to be correct?

0	But what's best for society is usually best for me, and so I am not disqualified from this debate. That's why I keep pointing out why it would be a bad thing to enslave people or oppress people because it hurts everyone in the end. That's what causes wars and crime a lot of the time. So yeah, I do go with what's best for me, but why should I go with any other way?If I was a fetus, well who knows what I'd think. That's a whole other debate that some other people have already gotten into but which I think is kind of pointless. My whole point is that we kill people every day whether you like it or not, so this whole right to life thing is nonsense. You may not be the one pulling the trigger, but you always contribute to deaths. But we try to select which deaths we cause so that those deaths will lead to the most happiness for everyone else. And I think that allowing abortion does lead to more happiness for society. And before you try to show me polls about abortion to prove that many people disagree with it, and so it causes them unhappiness, that's not the only thing I'm talking about. I'm talking about the unhappiness of the child born into an ungrateful family, the potential criminal problems, and all the other things that have already been mentioned. And yes, those are only potential problems, but that's how society works. We give people jobs based on their percieved potential, we admit people to college based on potential. You have to go with the odds, it's simply how life works.
1	You know, Gradualism isn't the only side of the story. There's also a model of evolution called Punctuated Equilibrium.
1	Oh, and I found this from here:  http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.   It appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. And the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. The only one getting anything wrong here is you.
0	I think the answer to that is much like J.P. Morgan's famous retort when someone asked him how much his yacht cost. 'If you have to ask, you can't afford it'. I'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons couldn't afford them, but if the interest isn't already there, it's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question.
1	Yes, and a plausible, possible explaination of how one evolved into another was presented, you're the only one talking about a creature not breathing for millions of years. This goes back to your complete lack of knowledge of evolution........ Where did you demonstrate that the avian lung could not evolve from the dinosaurian lung?
0	By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course, which is different to imprisonment of the criminal.
0	Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy.
1	Yes, but when the second amendment came out there was no  national guard.  So that didn't mean just the militia. Also if you notice it says there   2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of  the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the  Naval Militia.   So it can be anyone else capable of taking up arms.
1	I'll admit, it would be nice if life on our world was benevolent enough to not attack the weak. But the problem is, it's not. The gun laws in the US are diverse, and this is encouragement to criminals. It makes it easy for a criminal to obtain a handgun in Pennsylvania, for example, and take it up to New York for an unfair advantage over the weak. Life isn't sunshine and rainbows. Get used to it.
1	You know, I would be fine with that as long as it were truly a middle ground. If that term were used equally among straights as well as gays.But it's just a term. The same as with the term "marriage." It's just a term. Just a word.Personally I feel the government needs to get out of the business of marriage altogether. Let the legal term be agreed upon unilaterally.
0	You are SO insulting. "Oh, the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly." Who are you to say they aren't thinking clearly? I'll give it to you, Bassman. You are the most polite, best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered. You nearly had me fooled.
0	Well Steve  murder  is a legal term that does not apply in abortion. But for the sake of keeping this simple - yes, and not only that, it's legal.
1	Well, maybe some people's idea of Judeo-Christian. I know a lot of them got extremely angry when science showed that there are no biological human races. I'm thinking you're upset about what some people want to apply the new knowledge to do. Science isn't about application. Talk to doctors and engineers.
1	so are handguns.
0	Upon the case, and how far in she is. I will never believe in it, however my views upon what would happen AFTER she gave birth to the baby.  If she was too deep, then I think that her baby should be taken away from her. However, if she could be saved, I think that she should go into therapy, and then only when she is defined to be past postpartum depression, may she be allowed the privilege of handling human life. Anything else would be too dangerous to her and the baby.
0	Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only  possible way of creation. 
1	We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms. So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea. And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but won't say it now.
1	So what's the deal here? California won't even trust its own officers to do the concealed carry thing, and that's considered a reasonable way of doing things?
0	Well, until all those problems above are solved and we live in a utopia we'll still need gun-control. As long as we live in an imperfect society gun-control is necessary in the interest of public safety. Don't you keep bringing this subject up again and again?
0	So umm. What's going on? This was posted a week ago plus about 4 hours ago. I frankly don't care if my opponent posts a day late and would hate to win because of time. BUT the first post was even easier, he could have been typing it as we found judges and I think he mentioned he had started already. I PMed him earlier this week reminding him of the limit and have not recieved a response. Of course maybe the fact that he hasn't logged on since 11/14 has something to do with that.
0	I know, I just couldn't resist lol... it was more for me than anyone else.
0	Demonstrated by your postings.
1	Actually, no. It has been quite conclusively shown that the theory of relativity is correct. It is the sign of a scientific illiterate to claim that a theory is somehow doubted because it hasn't been "proven." No theory grows up to be a law.

He's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing XXXXXX that you get frequenting these boards (I can't say I blame him on the latter point).  Look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere...
0	Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say "Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this..."But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?
1	And they can be. Increases in complexity are readily achieved via incremental change.
1	You make a good point, but I?m going to watch this program on Thursday on FX Channel. I found a video clip of the abortion episode on YouTube.  Check it out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ScUKhmD7c8  (http://www.fxnetworks.com/30days/)
1	But it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.  I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is.
1	Actually its a pretty accurate interpretation. Take for instance the money spent by the catholic church promoting abortion restrictions, yet their tax exempt status has never seriously been called into question, that I know of. The fact of the matter is a couple hundred G's is a drop in the bucket for an organization the size of the LDS church, so proving that it is a substantial portion of their activities under section 501 would be difficult at best.
1	No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.
1	 Laws restricting ownership of any weapon is unconstitional.   Are you saying that private citizens should be able to own nuclear and biological weapons according to the second amendment?
1	The man made an aggressive move jumping out of the car. Notice the officer puts his hand on his service weapon as the man exits the car? Not a smart idea if you're carrying a gun, even with a CCW. The officer then sees or feels the gun and takes him down. There's a cut in the film just before the take down. What happens in the missing frames? We don't know.  You believe this encounter to be typical for folks packin' in public?  I'm not defending the officers necessarily but walk a mile in their shoes first.

1	Unique DNA does not mean it is distinct from the mother. Each of your somatic cells contain a mitochondria that has unique DNA from you.

0	So then the anti abortionists POV should, in your opinion, overrides the POV of the woman that the issue concerns? Why is it that to you the religious belief of the anti abortionist is more important then the body of the woman? The fetus is a parasite on the woman, just as a tape worm is. Are you then saying that if the cult of the tape worm arises, then their religious belief should then be forced upon those who suffer from tape worms.  Yes I know there is a difference between fetuses and tape worms but the principle is the same. Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body?
0	Rather like how a scientist should aspire to behave, really.
0	Yes, I am sure you can also keep morphine with more responsibility and greater safety than a hospital.  So do only those as responsible as you have the right to keep weapons? And how do they prove they have the responsibility of a Kelvinator?
1	Then let's move this discussion to another forum where it would be more appropriate.
0	Oh really, so blowing yourself and a bunch of other innocent people up in the name of Allah is a "great teaching"?
0	You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him. Fear made him do this. The fear was created in him by the buglers.  You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes, but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers.
1	Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also.
1	That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your "apple falling" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple. 
1	And it's only wishful thinking that they haven't. You are in no better position than I am. You don't know anymore than I do. Science has admitted that antarctica was much warmer several thousand years ago...not only that but the following map shows that the continent was not frozen. And if it was not frozen several hundreds years ago....and it was not frozen 4-5,000 years ago, as it was stated on this next seal link, then it's pretty safe to say that animals and humans could have both been there in recent history (within a few thousand years.) I agree this is no proof that it was attached, however, it is proof that the weather/temperature was DRASTICALLY different on antarctica than science has admitted.....and there's got to be a reason for this drastic change in temperatures.http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_1.htmhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...ent-seals.htmlIn an Antarctic "ghost town," freeze-dried whiskers, skin, and bones provide evidence that the South Pole was a much warmer place not too long ago, a new study reveals. "We thought, This is really strange. If they are elephant seals, what are they doing here?" Hall said. The discovery, scientists say, is the first hard evidence for a warming period in the region between 2,300 and 1,100 years ago. An earlier warming period, between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, has been recognized by other researchers and is believed to have been widespread, at least throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  (so widespread that there wasn't snow on the ground and it wasn't frozen over!)
1	You guys are going WAY overboard on this. The changes to the board of education standards will NOT materially change the way evolution is taught in Kansas, nor does it allow the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in our classrooms.  Our districts scientific advisory board says the changes to the curriculum make it  more factually accurate , and even the folks who drafted the original curriculum could find no factual fault with the new draft.  The chicken littles out there need to get a grip.
1	You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.  I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up.  So sorry, but you struck out.
1	Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.Our political philosophy is very clear on this:"that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" - Declearation of IndependaceYou have the right to try and revolt with violence. You don't have the right to win a revolt.
1	That's not quite true either. Federal laws grant many rights and privledges to married people. The feds may not have a say on who can get married, but there are federal laws that benefit married people.
1	Hold up, your changing your argument. You said "I have never been accosted by an armed assailant. Hence, I see no reason I need to carry a concealed handgun in order to be brave enough to move about my hometown.". This is the reason you gave for not carrying a firearm, I was simply countering that argument because it didn't sound very logical to me, still doesn't.As to your new statment, I'll need more info. What do your consider an "accidental discharge" of a firearm. I ask because I do not consider someone pulling the trigger to be "accidental" and therefore I consider true accidental discharges to be pretty uncommon.Yes, for most people I think the chances of being in a car accident are greater then the chances of needing a gun for self defense. But, I'm not sure why that would make a difference. If it was reversed I would still where my seatbelt.God Bless
1	all you have to do is scroll back a page or two in this forum...look for my posts regarding cichlids, guppies and lizards. I also gave you snails. show me any example of so-called natural selection or evolution in the field and I bet I can shoot it down.
0	So what's your solution; lay down and die? We've already seen that the UK isn't going to punish career criminals. How else can you have 50 convictions and still be on the streets robbing people?
1	And better yet, ask Sinjin what he and his cohorts are doing to teach gun safety? How much did he and or the Anti-gun orgs spend? The NRA spent more then 20 MILLION Dollars to teach children to STOP! DON'T TOUCH, LEAVE THE AREA, TELL AN ADULT!The NRA probably could and would do more however, EVEN JUST THAT, is called indoctrination by the Anti-gun crowed, and apparently even Sinjin! So is the criticism fair? Is the comparison he made fair? 
1	So Lewontin is the person who determines the opinion of the general public or something?
1	Try going to a concert, party, club, and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke....doubtful (unless it is second hand) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not. The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that doesn't mean every pot head will go to crack. HBO had a good special about this some time back.
1	No, it tests whether he is all-powerful. The proof shows that the very notion of all-powerfulness leads to other notions that are absurd, such as the unbreakable rock or, someone else posted, the round square. This is called  reduction to the absurd  and it is a valid logical method. It has been used to prove that 1/0 is undefinable.  I stated that he cannot do something inside of his own nature, that is, his nature doubles back on itself and is contradictory. Similarly if someone spoke of something that is  both green and not green at the same time and in the same sense  I can disprove this statement using the Law of Non Contradiction. Of course, one can pull off the rubbish argument that  it is incomprehensible, therefore it is true.  As I stated earler, such an argument is fallacious.
1	Actually that passage does not define a marriage.  It just says that a man shouldn't divorce his wife.  It does say that in the beginning god made man and woman.  You can infer whatever you wish about that, but it doesn't explicitly say anything about a marriage being strictly between a man and a woman.  Besides, if current laws were actually rooted in the Bible, in this passage, then divorce would be illegal. But our laws are NOT rooted in the Bible, so the passage is irrelevant.  I realize you were addressing a different point but I just had to respond.  Here is the whole context though:
0	Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.  I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.  I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.  We all lead your typical normal life.
0	So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
0	It's posted here in another thread at http://www.youdebate.com/vBulletin/s...5&amp;pagenumber=3  The car/gun analogy keeps being brought up. Kelvin hasn't addressed the objections to the car/gun analogy.

The identifying marks don't exist on them if they can't be traced, meaning the whole thing is a non-issue for everybody except those who have an axe to grind and rights to try and destroy.

1	Criminals get guns from strawman purchases. When someone with no criminal record legaly buy a gun to sell to a "friend" with a criminal record.They people who sell criminals guns do not just do it once, they do it again and again. Some of the guns used in Colombine were obtained this way. The seller knowingly sold them to minors and got less that 6 months in jail.Many times these people are not even prosecuted, will still have clean records, and will continue to buy and sell guns to "friends".If your serious about stopping availibility of guns to criminals, then these people should go into the slammer for a long long long time.http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontl...ocon/guns.html
1	Now you're being ridiculous. The big bang is not the evolution of the universe. The words  evolution of the universe  do not necessarily entail the big bang. For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.  But claiming that the  evolution of the universe  is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?  By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention  GTE  referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity.

If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an XXXXX. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.  Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.

1	The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.  Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK.
1	The flying spaghetti monster is similar to the term  flat earthers  - ridicule without substance. It's much more recent however. It was concocted in June of 2005 by one Bobby Henderson, a young college graduate with a degree in physics. He wrote it as a joke, as a response when the Kansas board of education took up the question of the teaching of ID in schools. That web page is a long one, with all the little pictures &amp; everything. It probably started more simply than that, and grew after it became the cult hit that it did. It got attention on many other websites, and in the press as well. The Washington Post reprinted it word for word, and a New York Times headline read  But is there intelligent spaghetti out there?  With that kind of publicity for a view that desperately gropes for talking points, it's not surprising that it comes up in many debates here. We should be able to get far beyond it in this debate - are you prepared? Both terms,  flat earthers  and  spaghetti monster  seem to come up much more often than  happenstance origins , or even  Darwinism , a 150 year old concept that's troubled by several recent discoveries. Happenstance origins is a serious term - I used it in my opening affirmative argument, and you haven't touched it. Can you?

But the Slippery Slope does not exist? Is that what you are saying? We have on this board alone, demands on our Constitution's Bill of Rights of total Gun Registration, Mandatory Storage with as of yet undefined penalties, a photo ID. Some advocate banning Assault Weapons, and you yourself have put forth several arguments that the 2nd amendment is not an Individual Right, and it applies only to a states right to form a militia. But the slippery slope does not exist!

The officers all know each other and play golf together.If the NG is the militia, then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools, hospitals, libraries, and churches. No federalization of NG. Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence, communication, and socializatlion, right down to even different uniforms.
1	Does gun-control violate any basic rights? Let's look at some areas of the US that have very strict gun-control laws. In Morton Grove, Illinois the local leaders decided to pass a law which required residents in their town to turn in their handguns to the police station.

Yet they know that there are characteristics of reality that they themselves cannot explain, though they probably seriously believe that astronomy is an exact, non-controversial science.

1	If our core is our mind, what is the mind? It is the brain, which is an organ and considered a body part. In reality, "mind" is an intangible byproduct of the body. However, the brain depends on other organs like the heart and lungs to keep going. The heart and lungs are in turn regulated by the brain. As you have said before, we don't have any evidence the mind lives on without the body. Therefore, it appears the existence of the mind is dependant on the existence of the body, not the other way around. This makes sense, since it is obviously the body that begins to develop first.

1	Well, that was a bait-and-switch but it wasn't very masterful. Actually, there are two color morphs in arctic foxes that are determined by a single locus. You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white. That is incorrect. It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen. That is why it is known as the "blue morph". The "white morph" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the "matter of months" that you state), and that isn't evolution. It is evolution that the arctic foxes, like many other northern and arctic animals like the Mustelidae, have evolved the ability to change colors with the seasons.

1	And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because "we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.

0	The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.
1	This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising "proofs" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, "explain" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?Ecclesiastes 1:6The wind goes toward the south,And turns around to the north;The wind whirls about continually,And comes again on its circuit.  How did they know that the earth "hangs on nothing" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?Job 26:7He stretches out the north over empty space;He hangs the earth on nothing.  How did they know that the "vapors" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?Jeremiah 10:13When He utters His voice,There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:“And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.He makes lightning for the rain,He brings the wind out of His treasuries.”  Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC—more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.Genesis 7:11In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.The story goes "They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."

1	 In 1993 a Swiss professor, Martin Killias, published a study of 18 countries concerning gun ownership, homicide and suicide. He in part concluded there was a weak correlation between total homicide and gun ownership. For a partial criticism of his study see Dunblane Misled where using the countries studied by Killias, these researchers found a much stronger correlation between firearm homicides and car ownership. More seriously, when the United States was included in the Killias study, a stronger correlation between total homicide and gun ownership was found. When two countries were excluded, the U.S. (high gun ownership, high murder rate) and Northern Ireland (low gun ownership, high murder rate) the correlation was marginally significant. Gary Kleck writes,  Contrary to his claim that 'the overall correlation is not contingent upon a few countries with extreme scores on the dependent and independent variable', reanalysis of the data reveals that if one excludes only the United States from the sample there is no significant association between gun ownership and the total homicide rate.  (Kleck, Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control, p 253. Walter de Gruyter, Inc. New York, 1997.) Kleck concludes that  the homicide-guns study was not international at all, but merely reflected the unique status of the United States as a high-gun ownership/high-violence nation...Since the positive association Killias observed was entirely dependent on the U.S. case, where self-defense is a common reason for gun ownership, this supports the conclusion that the association was attributable to the impact of the homicide rates on gun levels. 
1	And it is. The ToE is a theory, however. It explains evolution, which has been observed. Do not attempt to deny that.
1	I think it's pretty clear that this is in violation of the Supreme Court's current abortion jurisprudence, at least to the extent that one could actually figure that out. The question is, are there enough justices on the Supreme Court who would reverse the judge-made Constitutional Amendment which granted an absolute right to abortion.  This would not solve the problem as there would be many out there who would claim that they cannot be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs are available just like they can't be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs aren't available.  There really is nothing wrong with the States posessing power. In fact, it is quite in line with the Constitution if the States really did have more power than the Federal Government, which by the way, I do not believe is the case today.

The volunteer parents work in plain clothes, armed with concealed semi-automatic pistols, and are trained by Israel’s home guard. It is significant that in the more than a quarter century between Maalot and the incident mentioned above when the citizen guards shot down the terrorist in the school in 2002, not a single child was murdered in an Israeli school!"

1	See above regarding the nature of proof. What other plausible explanation is there? We have transitional fossils from so many strata between so many species, genetic markers in extant species indicating common ancestry - all life on earth dances to the common-descent beat. Yet you want us to make a special exception for humans, despite the exact same consillience between fossil evidence, genetic evidence, everything. You want us to hold in abeyance the conclusion that we share a common ancestor with the other apes, yet you can provide no remotely plausible alternative explanation.There comes a point where a thing not only looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, but swims, lays eggs, gets gang-raped by drakes and has 'DUCK' tattooed on it in large, friendly letters. At which point, continuing to insist that there's no proof it's a duck is starting to sound just a little bit silly.
0	That is the point. They are not neighbors, there are in a relationship and would get married if they could. I know my partner and I would! But despite your fancy wording they did stop Gay Partner Benefits. Hundreds lost there healthcare, now those people will take their tax money and leave Va. most likely to go to Mass. where they can have healthcare. And those in Mass who disagree with gay marriage may move to Va. Again, soon we will be a divided nation.
1	I think that what you two are doing is simply trading evidences. Saying someone is 'wrong' and directing them to a atheist web-site is not proof. You should merely be saying, 'here is an alternative argument'  I say this because I can access a number of science posts that state the exact opposite of what you say, and show that they can find evidence for a flood.
1	But what is adultery?  Mark 10:11:  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.  Matthew 19:9:  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance. According to Mark, all putting away is adultery, but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him. Which is it?

1	Well it all depends on who is going to determine  right , isn't it? Abortion is not math. There are no finite answers. Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable.
1	Any proof that the man was the legal owner of the gun and not a hoodlum or mugger or sociopath that was bent on murder?  I can come up with a lot of examples of police proving that they should never be armed, or even given a badge to wear. They've been caught trafficking guns to known criminals, tasering innocent bystanders, abusing their powers, and just plain breaking the laws for their own amusement.

Again, you simply lack any credibility.
1	And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a  high powered rifle  despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?  And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!  Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics.

1	Want to bet how fast a creationist here is going to try change the subject?  It's still a valid point though. You don't see the kind of anti-evolution bull**** posts on the reviews for textbooks like you do for political/religious books. And this applies to other online sellers too. That to me says that creationists aren't going to respectable sources to learn about a theory they declare false, instead getting their information from politics and religion. Going through Campbell's biology 7th and 8th editions, people are moaning about high costs, poor structuring, and how heavy the book weighs.  Interesting how those who decry evolution don't take their argument to the textbooks that teach it.

1	The major problem is that Sodini and others IDed as CCW holders are in fact not permit holders. The media is just as guilty as these pervert organizations. Either they are totally clueless about firearms laws or they are out to carry the water for the pro slavery express. In Soldini's case the closest he came to being a CCW holder was he purchased the pistols legally. He neither applied nor was granted a carry permit. The same was true of the Michigan case. We have no friends in the leftist media much to our detriment. Remember blood sells and the more of it the better it sells.
1	Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that.Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states.And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.
1	The health care system in Canada has undergone a dramatic change in the past ten years.  The conservative (relatively for Canada, US  conservatives  are our  fascists ) governments have been cutting away at Health Care in a blatant attempt to destroy the system.  Canadians love having public health care. In order to try to sway people into accepting some degree of privatization, the politicians make Health budgets which are completely impossible- because of pressure from huge US medical insurance companies.
1	As to your first point, as far as I can tell, you looked at the world and said, "Naw, there's no way this happened without God." And not just any God, but Trinity father son holy spirit God. The miraculous creation of our existance does not point to Christianity at all. However, you didn't just look at the 'miraculous creation,' no you had a study guide. Allow me to mention something right here, and point out I'm a Methodist....ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN. Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue, but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it. Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God. The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance, it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions.As to your second point, argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you haven't really put much thought into this contention. You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school. There is a good reason for this. I can't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said:"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." This means government isn't suppose to support religious groups. What would you define mandatory school prayer as? Anyone who has ever argued that a seperation between church and state isn't a good thing has obviously never been the religious minority. I lived in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and I can tell you state supported religion is not good.
1	There is either cause for little concern, or huge concern. The thickness of the ozone layer fluctuates over the years. So in fifty years it could be very thick. But, if it's in one of it's high thickness stages, and there are holes in it in some places, and extremely thinness in others, we're in trouble.
0	no, you just live on delusions.  you can't argue the merits of creationism on their own because they don't exist.   Creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution.
1	There are some very rare cases where abortion is legitimately allowable by society. However, most abortions do not fall under this catagory.
1	But you are trying to debunk the theory, right? If it can be accepted by atheists, agnostics, theists, and the catholic church, how can you say that it is completely atheistic?
1	No, our Constitution doesn't really  forbid  it, what it does forbid is the government from forming a  state  religion. This has been interpreted to the benefit of all, to also mean that our laws cannot represent one specific religious belief system.  Granted, I do agree that a religious argument in terms of law is like comparring apples to a chair.

1	the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years.

How does protein last 68 million years? Anyone who believes this is out of their mind.

One could easily argue that those with naturally higher than average testosterone levels would want to hold a gun more than they would a stupid child's toy.Millions of people are carrying guns every day, and they're not having hostile encounters with other people. Not even in high stress situations. That kind of blows your "study" out of the water.Try again.
1	I have a feeling that the tradtitional marriage the Dobson is refering to is only about 100 years old. Hardly traditional if you view it in the perspective of history. Up until the turn of the 20th century marriage was about property. The man physically owned the woman and the children. I sometimes laugh at these cithgaps, espically the women, when they talk about defending the traditional marriage. They are trying to defend a redefinition of something that has allready been redefined.
1	Unless they successfully implement legislature based on religious dogma that breaches religious freedom of non-believers. Which is her stated goal.
1	Well, the easy answer is that a lizard didn't evolve an avian lung. There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung. However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say. To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself.

1	there is no doubt the human body is all about manifestation of energy, not just electrical. just saying "hi" is creating sound energy through the kinetic energy of your jaw muscles, lung and vocal cords, which was converted from the chemical energy stored in the food you ate. but proving that energy occurs in the human body does not address the question of life itself. If life itself is a form of energy, then it must either be constant at all times (ie, cannot be created or destroyed). Or, it can be converted from one form to another. or both...

1	just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.

1	Keep Going:"F. Myth #6: The Second Amendment militia is the National Guard. The Founding Fathers made it clear that the Militia was composed of the populace at large. Both the Congress and Supreme Court have affirmed this definition of the Militia. 1. Founding Fathers * George Mason: "I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers."145 * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): "That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty...." * Richard Henry Lee: "To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle."146 2. U.S. Congress * The Militia Act of 1792. One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution, Congress passed a law defining the militia. The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia. Furthermore, every citizen was to be armed. The Act stated: "Every citizen... [shall] provide himself with a good musket, or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints...."147 The Militia Act of 1792 made no provision for any type of select militia such as the National Guard. * U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982). "In the Militia Act of 1792, the second Congress defined 'militia of the United States' to include almost every free adult male in the United States. These persons were obligated by law to possess a [military-style] firearm and a minimum supply of ammunition and military equipment.... There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia,' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms, and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard."148 * Current Federal Law: 10 U.S.C. Sec. 311. "The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and... under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States...."149 3. Supreme Court: U.S. v. Miller (1939). In this case, the Court stated that, "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense... [and that] when called for service, these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time."150 "emoticonXKill emoticonXKill emoticonXKill "The Right of the People"
0	Oh, is THAT where you are getting your anti-evolution information: The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book dealing with biology that was written not by a biologist, but by an engineer...right? Walter James ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And gee whiz, biologists don't agree with ReMine ... how strange! :-)  PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine himself when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.
1	AF is 9th district playground. If they pass the ban, the 9th will uphold it as constitutinal, and the supreme court will likely refuse to hear the case (as they alwasy have before) since, unlike the DC gun ban, they can't wriggle theri way out of it by saying that citizens of washinton DC don't get the same rights as the rest of us.
0	Yes, and depending on how you define morality.  I'm not asserting that just law can be determined devoid of right or wrong. Just that law should not step every time something is immoral.  Do you? For example, I deduce from your posts that you perhaps see homosexuality as immoral. For you don't think same gender marriage should be allowed. However, I'll venture to guess -- and you can certainly correct me -- that you don't think homosexuality should be illegal. Even though you think it's immoral.

1	You would think from Adams words that all one need do to say cure diabetes is to decide that it would be profitable to do so. Problem is that cures can only be found with knowledge and fundamental knowledge at that. Diabetes is NOT a simple dise ase and its likely we do not know enough yet to cure it. MAYBE stem cells are a partial answer, but they will only be partial, maybe genetic modification is part of the answer (insulin resistance and all that). Maybe prevention (how?) is the answer. Maybe the answer is something we have not imagined yet. Maybe there is no ONE answer. These are not simple problems and while diet and exercise are useful and to be highly recommended they will not prevent all diabetes or any other disease. One thing is certain if reseach on the problem is not funded adequately progress will be minimal.

As a matter of fact, there are a number of really ugly customers in men, a great number of extremely hateful men:

From there on the organization has developed very much)The signal, the SETI people got showed the first three prime numbers. This is very strange because it has never happened before (the scientist who detected the signal, called it WOW-signal, because it was so strange)This signal shows a major part of Design: SpecificationBut unfortunately, to show that it is really true, it is missing another part: ComplexityThe signal is evidence, but unfortunately it is too short. If those scientists would detect a signal that shows the prime numbers from 2 to 101 it would meet both parts: it has specification and complexity...The SETI people would party all night...So these "theories" aren't as unproven as you think they are...(I still don't believe it happened like that)
1	An amount of violence miniscule in comparison to the violence caused by Christians intolerant of other religion; look to the Crusades and the Inquisition if you please. Look at the justification for the slaughter of Native Americans. Look even today at the ruthless murders of gay people.But just as I would not judge all Christians by the actions of some, it is inappropriate to judge all evolutionists by the actions of some.Overall, I don't think this author brought up any legitimate point against evolution except for the lack of transition species, which is an interesting topic in itself.However, if the author had proven that the world is young, the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time, for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution. If the author had proven that evolution hadn't occurred, then the most logical explanation that some similar, natural process is the cause. But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct.See, the author has made a mistake fatal in debate: he has attack his opponent's viewpoint, then stated that since his opponent is wrong, he is correct. But that is not true, for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct.I, for example, might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth, then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today. I could have then stated exactly all of the things this author stated, only replacing those Biblical quotes with writings about Vampires, and I could have come to the same conclusion. Since the evolution is wrong, then I am right.But that's just not good enough. Even if he had proved evolution were wrong, there is no more reason to believe in the supernatural than there is to believe in Vampires, Dragons, Pixies, or any other mythological creation. This doesn't mean that those things don't exist, just that there is no reason to believe in them.

1	Oh boy, trying to tie Bayesian statistics to the number of assumptions! Nowhere in Bayesian analysis is there a term for number of assumptions.Once again you are trying to tie number of assumptions to the correctness of a hypothesis. There is no such connection. It doesn't exist. In science, you only use data to evaluate hypotheses. In Bayesian analysis, each study represents more DATA, not a change in assumptions.

1	Count me as one of those 14% since he hasn't demonstrated anything of the sort. And it isn't imposing our religion on anyone at all just because we rely on scriptural values in determining what is right and wrong in life. This is the greatest corruption of common sense that can be revealed regarding how the humanist thinks. What better way to erase scriptural based morality from the public debate than to assert that just by holding to a biblical value system in life is to impose ones religion on the atheist? This is the goal and defines the agenda of the atheist as it proves that at every level of public discourse it is their goal to claim that any spiritually based value system which opposes secular humanism, opposes the Constitution which couldn't be further from the original intent of the Constitution if it tried. The constitution was neither anti-bible or anti-christian. Nor was it anti-spiritual interpretation or application of the laws of the land which is evident by those very laws which exist and compliment spiritual values of christian americans throughout our history.So your not very interesting opinion piece by these so called intellectuals fail on all counts as they must pervert and corrupt what has always been accepted values in this Country in order to reinterpret history if they hope to succeed in this application.
1	Okay, you are right... we need a definition for a 'hole,' as it is a bit of a subjective concept. Allow me to define 'hole' like this: The void created by the intentional destruction of something already in existence. Using 'hole' with this definition makes Alcorn's statement (minus the word 'terrible') a true fact in the physical realm. And it precludes any of your other ideas from creating 'holes,' since they all deal with potentiality, not reality.

A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail.You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia.

1	Nobody but you has suggested that the schools are out any money except for you, and you have presented no evidence whatsoever that they are. You ignore the LIKELY scenarios and immediately jump to an extremely UNLIKELY one that fits your agenda...that they used school facilities without paying for them.Our local school district rents out school buses to groups and rents building facilities out for events all the time. It is smart....they have the resources on hand and it provides a little extra money for the district. Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that. As far as the cops go....have you ever seen a protest where there were NOT cops on hand? I certainly never have. Even when Fred Phelps and his little band of sickos protests a funeral, the police are there to make sure that nobody starts handing out beat downs. One of the beautiful things about America is that you have the right to protest, and the police have a responsibility to protect you while you do it. The idea that the DC police would not have protected the BOA executive is another completely unsupported assumption put forth here and to some degree by the author of the article and frankly it is a particularly ignorant one. The author of the article contends that if the protesters had decided to burn the guys house there is nothing the DC police could have done to stop it since they were outside their jurisdiction AFTER they talk about the fact that there is a cross jurisdictional agreement in place. Frankly you would have to have the intelligence of a house plant to follow that line of reasoning.Your take on this entire thing is ridiculous and unamerican. There is no evidence whatsoever that anything improper took place here. What happened is that a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law went and told a guy that he is a huge XXXXX. The DC PD sent 2 units to ensure that nobody was hurt during the course of the protest. The local police also sent units in response to calls from neighbors. The local police stayed until the end, but no arrests were made because, as they noted in their statement, the protesters were careful not to break any laws. I believe that you, sir, are little more than a partisan hack bending reality to fit your agenda.

1	Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? Is this some kind of hybrid model? Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation.

1	Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this, and I quote: People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.ANDArch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, I mean, how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all. And you call that debating?

1	So you don't have genes in your body that aren't activated? Aka my father has blue eyes and my mother brown eyes. I have 1 blue eye gene in my body yet I don't have 1 blue eye and 1 brown eye. But 2 brown eyes. So it's obviously not active.(ok bad example) Don't know the exact name for it. But don't rabbits have a genetic response hard coded. As every animal. That when they are being chased that they make irratic maneuvres. He says that the chickens had genes that had some hardcoded information about how to respond to certain conditions. They got activated in them. And the same information was passed to the children. So they don't come out all big eyed and is mister big teeth my uncle?
1	And the follow-on that Archie throws out there demonstrates his ignorance on the subject.Such laws DO NOT just protect homosexuals.They protect EVERYBODY from being fired just cause they are gay OR straight (or bisexual or nonsexual).It protects the straights just as much as it protects the gays.It has nothing to do with "better than" or "superior".If people like Archie understood legislation like ENDA, they wouldn't try to make such an absurd allegation! emoticonXEmbarrassed
0	Until you have chosen to stand in uniform between the criminal element and the law abiding in our communities; until you have felt the anguish of attending a funeral service for a fallen brother, until you have felt the helplessness and shed tears resulting from an inability to prevent someone from seeing harm; until you have stood upon our streets and offered service in defense against those that would seek to do others harm; you have no ground on which to stand in making such comments!!!Law enforcement, as a whole, exhibits a love of community that few can even comprehend. Every day we place ourselves in harms way, in the hope that we can prevent some of the evil that lurks in our world. We do this by choice. No one has forced us into this position. We do this because we are of a breed that is able and willing to fight in the face of evil. We do this knowing that it is unlikely that we will win this war, but that it is the fight which matters. Our reward for such service?? Last year, my net income was a little over $42,000. We are constantly berated by a public that has no real comprehension of what we struggle with on a daily basis. We are often held in contempt by many, for life and death decisions we make in a split second with little or unreliable information. Our families are often victims of the stresses created by our chosen profession. I have encountered grief over the evils of man that you and many others have no way of even imagining.DO NOT sit safely behind your keyboard, and pretend that you have some insight into what we think and feel, until you are prepared to stand where I have stood for the past twelve years.Justin

1	I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.

0	It is irrelevant what Sanger's viewpoint on eugenics was. Even if we accept that she did advocate it remember birth control is not eugenics in itself but one of the tools used to meet its aims. It does not follow that birth control leads to genocide (if we stick to definition at least).

0	According to your logic, an infant would have no right to suck nutrients from a woman's breast. Would you as quickly assert the mother has no duty to care for the infant?
1	No. I think that certian people are going to continue chiping away at the constution until things reach a critical mass, then there will be a violent correction. It is inevitable that a government whose growth is as radical as our governments will eventually collapse under it's own weight (see  Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire ).  The majority of Americans cannot describe america without including the words  freedom  and  rights . These are the supposed cornerstones of American society. When people see our constition, especially the bill of rights, chipped away at, I think it makes them uncomfortable, even if they do tolerate it.

1	So you don't believe that God took a rib from Adam's side to create woman? Genesis 2:21-23 "So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man." lurch:I don't have time to quote everything you said so I'll just comment on it. You guys keep saying that "of course, religion and science can co-exist perfectly". When did I say that they couldn't? I simply said that fundamentalist Christianity and evolution could not co-exist. Catholics are a perfect example, they do not believe that they can pray to God directly. They believe that they have to pray through a priest, saint, etc. That is not fundamentalist Christianity. You keep trying to make an argument out of something that I am not arguing about. You also say that creationism cannot co-exist with "science". You say that evolution is science. If creationism can't co-exist with evolution, then how can there be any evolution believing Christian fundamentalists? (thistown for example.) Creationism, by the way, is used very broadly. It is simply the study of how we were created, just as evolution is the study of how we "evolved". They can be used to mean the same thing if you are a Christian who believes in evolution.BTW, science isn't the "evil work of Satan". It's man's way of trying to explain something so that they don't have to believe in something that threatens the way they enjoy living. (The Bible.)
1	So you're claiming as a christian that your God is the same God of the moslem Faith? Is that what you're saying brother Dane?
1	Actually, there is no evidence to support creationism, which is based on the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen. Thus, the creationism v. evolution debate becomes an effort by creationists to discredit evolution rather than an effort to offer evidence for creationism. The reason is simple - there is no evidence that supports creationism.  On the other hand, it is intentional ignorance to claim that the earth is only 6,000 years old, that there was a universal flood about 4500 years ago, or that the millions of species in the world today evolved from a few thousand species at most at rates no evolutionary biologist would even consider possible. Creationists deny evolution and then offer hyperevolution when they realize that their position is impossible.
1	lol....With regard to slavery, the Civil War was fought to establish the principle that  All men (persons) are created equal.  A fetus is a unique and individual person whose location happens to be inside it's mothers womb. If all persons are created equal, one person does not have the right to descriminate and destroy another person solely because of their location or because they are smaller.

1	No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.
1	Can you really see that Grizzly?  It would literally cause a revolution in certain States.  Obama needs everybody on his side in the forseeable future.  There wont be any real attempt for at least a generation I think.  Not until the American public accepts a much more left wing government than they would today.  As long as there is a lot of opposition I cant see it happening.
1	For sure about 6000 years.
1	Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?

1	Actually, all evolutionists must have faith for their theory to be true. Can you prove that the big bang happened 15 billion years ago? No, all the evidence that we have in favour is the red shift of starlight and the background microwave radiation (which is all at the same temperature, give or take a few K). We all know how evolutionists interpret the evidence, but the evidence makes just as much more sense when interpreted through Dr Humphreys' new young earth relativistic cosmology model. This is outlined in his book "Starlight and Time" and is an amazing read. So the same evidence (e.g. redshift, CBM radiation) makes sense in both models (although CBM causes a little trouble in the big bang theory). But we have no human eye witness accounts of the big bang or even creation unfolding. Nor we can observe life coming from lifeless chemicals, nor we can observe life going from simple to complex - today we observe mutations and natural selection going in the opposite direction. Basically, no one was there to see the supposed evolution of all things. We have no eye witness accounts of any of these events, they certainly cannot be repeated or experimented upon today. This means that the evolutionist must take his belief in evolution by faith as he cannot prove that it happened here today in the present.

1	What laws are these that you speak of? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.
0	And by old fashion I assume you mean Greece a couple of thousand years ago. That's the only place and time I can think of off hand where the populace (by which I mean landed men in this case) could vote to change laws. In this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law is via the courts, and always has been.  However, I don't think that is, in fact, what Jyoshu was refering to.

1	This is just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise Peddlar, that things can happen over time? Not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have been made and then tested - protein homology for one, there is no way anyone knew the answer before hand but what was observed later when technology improved is what was expected. DNA dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do.There is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime.

0	Its not at all necessary to resort to calculations or any other scientific refutation. You cannot refute that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent being could in fact flood the earth on a whim. The claims and assertions as to the properties of the being negate any possible scientific refutation since they deny that the laws of physics etc are inviolable. GOD can do whatever he chooses with absolutely NO restrictions - so a flood is well within his capacity.

1	Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!  I don't see why we should care how many weapons couldn't be traced back to America even though they came across the border, because it's a moot point. The identifying marks don't exist on them if they can't be traced, meaning the whole thing is a non-issue for everybody except those who have an axe to grind and rights to try and destroy.
0	What I'm saying is, if the police are going to abandon you, and the law prohibits you from protecting yourself with deadly force, what defense do you have should somebody decide that they're going to victimize you?  Exactly what kind of qualifications are you going by in declaring a nation  developed  if the government is unable to protect you, and they've actually made it a crime to try and protect yourself during your time of need?

1	Well at least in the US you can't. Also in the US if a law suit is brought it is normaly not about getting treatment it's about pain a suffering compensation. In the US if you bring a law suit there is virtualy no risk of having to pay the defendants legal fees if they win so there is no risk to the person or law firm in bringing a suit. This is why frivilous law suits are rampent in the US. Most insurance companies will settle a suit than take it to trial since it costs less to settle.

From previous posts, it seemed like you agree that mental existence is crucial, but I wasn't sure, given your responses on this thread.  So, do you or don't you agree that mental existence is crucial to our existence as people?

It doesn't show that we have high crime rates whichever stats you accept.
1	Then I'd like to see your definition of the scientific method. As I recall, the scientific method is purely secular.  What evidence of God? Please, show me such evidence. There is no evidence of God. God is of the supernatural, you cannot prove the supernatural with evidence from the natural! God cannot be proven, nor can it be disproven. There is no evidence of God, and there is no evidence that there is no unorthodox God.

1	Let's do some math,... The average American already works halfway through the month of April paying the government it's share of our earned income. That's over a third of our total gross income and for some Americans and businesses, it is nearly 50%.  And yet, you are saying that we need only pay a little bit more,... and we can have FREE ( ) Healthcare.  The same government that Spends 15 dollars to give ONE to a person in need, is going to give us  FREE  (Gawd I love that word),...  FREE Healthcare?  Free?  Must be that new math.  You see, for every single dollar the government spends on someone in need,... it has to take at least three dollars from you, me and everyone else. Their (the governments) buildings, cars and infrastructures has to be maintained, government employees financial needs and payroll must be met, their benefits provided, computers, telephones, jails, judges, convicts tried, housed, fed, defended, parks, roads, bridges,... our miltary (remember them?)

1	There is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism. Binocular vision works. Its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately. The lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d, as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent. It isn't an eye for defending against predators, and it doesn't need one. As for insects, the fact that they've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well. Have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately?
0	Should it be legalized? Only if every other country did it  Is it harmful? Yes more so then moderate alcohol use and worse then smoking  Should it be taxed once legalized? Yes.  Should laws still apply to it, such as DUIs and the like? Yes.
1	But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption.
0	Sometimes having an abortion is the best option for them and their family. Financial commitments like a mortgage mean that many people need their full wage to get by, and if the mother had to go on maternity leave they would be seriously struggling and unable to feed their existing family. There are millions reasons for choosing to have an abortion and if a woman doesn't want to go through with a pregnancy, that is her decision as it's her body and her life that would be changing, and if she is unwilling to change her life she would hardly be an ideal person to become a fantastic mother.  I wouldn't ever say abortion is a good thing, and in an ideal world it wouldn't be necessary, but people make mistakes and birth control is not 100% effective so it's always going to be needed.

1	So it's shifted from  no new structures  to  I can think of a structure that can't evolve.  Me too. Evolutionary theory says that some things are not possible to evolve. But new structures, as you learned, do evolve.
1	I think the christians you describe do not disregard creation in Genesis per sae. They would agree absolutely with your 2 fundemental truths at the start of your post. However, they do not see it as a history as such, but more as an analogy to what happened. Some take it simply to say that God created the universe and put a soul in humans and find the detail of that (not the soul bit) in what we have discovered through science. Others would say it becomes "historical" at a certain point- Adam and Eve or maybe Noah. I don't think they are any less christian than those who choose to believe the story of creation literally, and it would surprise me to hear someone say that was the case.I think it does pose some awkward questions to hold such a view though, and while I don't see all your 8 examples in your later post as being the ones I have heard, they are certainly of that nature.Christianity has struggled with the logical conclusions of observation of the physical world for much time. Some of the examples from history are amusing today- the Omphilodian Heresy where the very discussion of whether Adam and Eve had navels was a heinous religous crime. The Heliocentricity debate where the Catholic Church eventually relented their scripture based denial of the earth orbiting the sun. And today the debate over the old earth and evolution.This seems to arrive from the fact that the religon is so encompassing in its assertion of truth. While this helps to create a powerful system of belief, it can put it in an awkward position when new discovery is made. The nature of peolpe seems to be the same conflicts have arisen again and again- with just the point of contention changing.
0	So given that there are cases where both dies... we just have to give up the mother's right to live over a fetus (which will die)? What if the mother isn't physically ready to have a baby. In the case of a young female (I'm talking age of 9 and younger, cause there are cases of young kids having their periods) being raped, doesn't she a "baby" (and I say baby, because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin)... have the right to live? For me, if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own, physically or mentally... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world.Abortion should be pro-choice.
1	So how do you explain the nylon bug? It can do something its ancestors could not - for the very simple reason that it's not the same as its ancestors.
1	The fact that it's the truth is why I keep repeating it.
1	Here is how the exchange went down. Person one. We need to teach morals to our students. Person two. Well if you do that, who's morals will you teach? I may disagree.No one could answer that question so they taught no morals. I think we should start by agreeing that things like, but not exclusively, murder, stealing, and hate is wrong. Teach that in which we can agree!
1	One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.  In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.
1	And that is different how? I told johnny to write that I'm infallible. Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I'm infallible. There is no difference.
0	Oh I've got no doubt that you do, and that you wish much worse on him than that as well.
1	Actually, no, they don't. The job of the Navy is to protect U.S. national security. They are not charged with the defense of private citizens sailing international waters.

0	Yep. This is why he posts the same stuff over and over and over on as many forums as he can.
0	Well, it was not conceived through an act of love but by an act of violence. Granted, it isn't the babies fault and that would be a very sad situation. I suppose, even being a pro-lifer, that I could get behind justifying an abortion due to rape in consideration of the unwilling, violent conception and the mental trauma of the mother BUT I think that the rape should be reported within 24 hours for the person to qualify for this "loophole." It should be reported BEFORE the victim is aware of any pregnancy. Coming forth weeks or months after the fact is too suspicious and gives the appearance that they are just crying rape as an excuse for a justified abortion.
1	It seems apparent that you didn't understand what you read. What you are saying is that a pressure regulatory valve on a steam engine is responsible for moving the train.
1	Actually that passage does not define a marriage. It just says that a man shouldn't divorce his wife.It does say that in the beginning god made man and woman.You can infer whatever you wish about that, but it doesn't explicitly say anything about a marriage being strictly between a man and a woman.Besides, if current laws were actually rooted in the Bible, in this passage, then divorce would be illegal. But our laws are NOT rooted in the Bible, so the passage is irrelevant. I realize you were addressing a different point but I just had to respond.Here is the whole context though:
0	So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
0	Why don't you take your own advice?  What would it take to change YOUR mind on abortion?  BTW, this, 'I said.  I'll chain you to the bed before I let you kill our child. ' from your post #1 in this thread clearly indicates your true attitude.  What kind of a man would chain a pregnant woman to a bed for the duration of a pregnancy?  Now, while you are asking others what would change their minds, the question of what it would take to change YOURS looms ever larger.
0	I don't give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either(obvious here I am not saying I don't care what happens to either, but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance). Neither one should have a right to kill the other...and for that matter, no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn. So my views are still treating them as equals.and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can't prove.
1	But private citizens run background checks on other citizens all the time. I rent property. I make sure my tenants aren't felons before I lease anything. I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon. It is just something I personally would choose to do if I didn't know the buyer I was selling to...
1	It doesn't have to be that way because it's the death penalty. It's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system.
1	I've not honestly watched it yet (have crappy internet connection at the moment, might watch when I go home from Uni), but it could be just die to stimulus/response or a pure reflex. The brain could easily not be involved and its unlikely to be aware of what its doing, if its not just another artefact of the speeding up the film (i.e being poked and moving due to being manipulated but seeming to struggle rather than being moved)  Pro-choice and developmental biologists are quite different, I'd be worried if you had none on the pro-life side of the debate yet all agree on the period of time it takes for certain structures to develop.
1	wrong again,  only 154 justifiable homicides out of thousands of murders  * In 2005, 30,694 people in the United States died from firearm-related deaths - 12,352 were murdered; 17,002 killed themselves; 789 were accidents; 330 died by police interventi
1	Only a handful of the 300+ million people that live in America actively participate in the use of illegal drugs. Blaming all of America for their desire to break the laws and throw away money is dishonest.  Stop blaming gun owners for the problems in Mexico. You obviously hate this country so much, move out and go over to Britain.
0	Many who voted for this said as much. They're hoping that in a few years gays will actually get full rights. We can only hope.
1	Cite the books. As far as I know, the evolution of the peppered moths is used as an example of natural selection. You don't seem to have understood. Again, cite the books. None I ever used ever claimed that it was proof of evolution.
0	Really? I have argued that God is an epic liar? Can you point out me arguing that at all you EPIC LIAR? Once again you are interpreting what I have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours, and then extrapolating that I am now arguing in favor of calling my God an EPIC LIAR. Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective? emoticonXBanghead emoticonXDonno I mean, how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man, because of our linear view of time, is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred, that God is then an epic liar? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space? It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child! But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there. emoticonXGood

1	You sure this is not another Piltdown Man?  A corresponding article in my local paper brought out some interesting points regarding this.  The revision of the fossil's age  makes the date of the fossil record almost exactly concordant with the dates suggested by genetic studies for the origin of our species.   Could this be an example of making the results what we thought they should be?  It puts homosapiens in Africa many thousands of years before our species appears on any other continent.  It strengthens the notion that modern humans lived during much of their history alongside other human species.  The discovery last year of a new and distinct species of pygmy-sized humans on the Indonesian Island of Flores shows that at least two separate species of humans coexisted on the planet as recently as 18,000 years ago.  Boy, won't that raise the hair on the back of a hardcore creationist?
1	They don't have to. The government is exercising violence by threatening people with jail time if they cause injury to somebody else who's attacking them.
1	Because Matthew, society has to take the time to define its standards. We don't start with the assumption that anything-goes; standards are developed over time. Your question is no different than the recent couple in Germany in the news who are brother and sister wondering why they should not be allowed to marry. Marriage laws have to have limits somewhere in terms of what sort of arrangements of people suffice to be considered marriage, and this is all a part of simply determining (over time) where those limits fall.Many rights in our society DID have to go through a people-deciding process, so you are wrong that on no other issue do we see that sort of thing happening. In fact, even with civil rights itself, it happened in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It happened earlier than that with women's suffrage. Voting on civil rights is a well established precedent. Some things have become rights, some haven't. It's a process that our society goes through in defining its standards. The problem is that some in your movement seem to want to circumvent that process.

1	Weird, str8 atheists have been civilly marrying for eons without special stipulations - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor  Meh....  I personally think  religious protection  is much adieu over nothing, as the EXISTING first amendment adequately protects. With interracial marriage, we didn't have churches  forced  to perform interracial marriages they didn't want to perform.  The same would be true of gay marriage, and I have yet to see a U.S. example disproving the protection of a church from not having to perform the gay marriage, and/or not having to allow it within their private church.  But whatever...  The legislature can easily make these changes, if the governor is accurate in saying that is all the changes amount to.  New Hampshire could soon be state #6...
0	Are you incapable of reading, as well as being mind-numbingly assinine? The thread is about creationism, not evolution. Attacking evolution does not defend the lies of creationists. Your failure to defend biblical creation shows that you cannot support your own position and instead have to resort to petty nit-picking of your opponent's position. This is both stupid and intellectually dishonest.

1	Actually, had hemp and marijuana been legal and cultivated widely in this country since 1937, it would have tanked along with the rest of our economy. Right now as an outside industry looking in, it has the potential to generate billions of dollars in California alone. The taxes generated alone from the sale of marijuana could be massive. The Obama administration has made clear that it is no longer going to support the practice of raiding so called cannabis clubs in California, where "medical" marijuana is dispensed. Many in California want to take it a step beyond, and move towards decriminalization and regulation of cannabis in the same way we regulate alcohol. Will the federal government step in and stop this, or are they going to actually do the constitutional thing and support state's rights to make and enforce their own laws? Will the federal government consider amendment of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970?

0	But mentally handicapped children are worth less than the rest of us? You have to explain why some zygotes are inviolate and others are able to be aborted morally.
1	More misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. This implies that evolution is some kind of progress. That idea is the reason that Darwin objected to the use of the word "evolution" in reference to his theory. Evolution is genetic change in populations over time.

1	just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.

0	Not true. I believe in "some" gun control measures. However, I also believe in my right keep and bear arms, and use such arms as I see fit in defense of myself and others. It's not an all or none thing in my book.
1	I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill, and they happen to get pregnant anyways, it will cause you to miscarry (not always, but sometimes). Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant. But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine, who is Catholic, that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I'm not sure on that though, since I'm not Catholic myself.
1	nah, I was just poking fun because I can! Personally, this isn't a debate. It is a joke. I also think duo could be right that it is an evolution person.
1	That's the opinion I hold, that CCWs shouldn't be required. But this thread assumes that CCWs are required.
1	And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.
1	You seem to think that any time someone is killed, the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator  devalued human life . If that was the case, gun manufacturers, car manufacturers, breweries, and cigarette manufacturers would  devalue human life  simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse. And the government would  devalue human life  by letting these companies operate under it. We do not go targeting innocent civilians. More often than not, the civilians are killed by Iraqi suicide bombers or  militia , and the few that are killed by the US are accidents.
1	Yes, because atheists love it when New Orleans gets drowned in water and thousands die. Hell, I know I'm throwing a party tonight, going to get my atheist friends over, and my pagan brothers to.

1	Sartre, you know little of history.  Until relatively recently within the history of humankind, the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan--oh, how they loved their males, men were next to God in their eyes, a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church--ruled on the existence of infants within his clan. If he chose, this next to God male, the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance. If he chose not, the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or, perhaps, might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer. In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused, used as a sexual toy--hmmm, kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil. Interesting.

He never expected to find fossil humans on a dinosaur expedition."funny, isn't it, how the human and the dinosaur are at the surface! Shouldn't there be at different stratas? Shouldn't erosion have kicked in somewhere in between the death of the dinosaur and the death of the human, some 60 million years later?????

0	So what? Whether killing is a personal or impersonal matter, the bottom line is that somebody IS going to be killed and that's all there is to it. I highly doubt somebody's BEING killed is of less importance than HOW they were killed.
0	Excellent point. If the government only gave civil unions to everyone (heteros and gays alike) and the churches got to do the religious side of it, Civil Unons would be excellent. Unfortunately, those opposing gay marriage would never agree to such a thing.
1	I know this is an old posting, but I thought I would add to it. I have built several 1911 clones. Press forge the frame (and slide, sometimes), then mill the parts. I use a CNC mill (about $750,000). A lot fo guys, though, use a $300 minimill from harbor freight. A setup for press forging the parts (press forging is the better modern alternative to drop forging) will set you back less than $200, if you are a good scrounger.Gun building is probably a more common hobby than you might think. It is hard to tell exactly how many people are doing it, because a homebuilt gun requires no registration, permit to build, or any of that other XXXX (unless you are building an NFA firearm, which is a machine gun). There is even a yahoo group about building your own gun. Fro the faint of heart (those who don't want to forge or cast theri own reciver/frame) there are a bunch of places that will sell you an 80% finished reciever, which doesn't count as a firearm from a legal viewpoint. I always buy my barrels since it is too much work to do the rifling. In a pinch, it could be done, it just wouldn't be a competition grade barrel. Of course, most firearms you buy don't come with a stock competition grade barrel.
1	The statement was made in an address to the Pontifical Acacemy of Sciences in 1996. It is clear that the Pope considers the theory of evolution to be valid. However, this is not a an encyclical and not a statement ex cathedra. Therefore it is not a statement of doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. However, he is stating that, recognizing a restriction, the theory of evolution does not contradict Christian faith. He reaffirmed the statement made by Pius XII of that restriction. They is, "If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God."So yes. Catholics may be theistic evolutionists, evolutionary creationists or ID creationists. I suppose they can even fit into the other categories. I have known some YEC Catholics.
1	I made no such equivalent criticism - which would have been along the lines of 'There may well be no designer, which would rule out design'. I don't want or need to invoke unknowable unknowns to criticise ID. You're speculating about just such a thing, the likelihood of which is unquantifiable, whereas we know that patterns arise in nature in the absence of design. Moreover, you're hypothesising a natural bias that prevents the most fit variants from proliferating - but that very bias would disqualify them as 'most fit' and make something else 'most fit' instead.

1	In this case, I will present the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection as evidence that life is evolving. As the evidence has been shown to support it, you are the person who should be presenting evidence. Currently, your assertion that organisms are "devolving" because of mutations has been shown to be faulty.
1	I'd more describe it in terms like trebor's. It is a very interesting find though, and it adds more knowledge to our understanding of how the ear formed. From  our  point of view (as mammals) it shows how the original land vertebrate ear developed and we can then see how further modification over time (the development of the mammalian jaw) lead to the development of the mammalian ear with its three bones- an excellent example of how evolution works by modifying existing structures into new forms.

He had introduced a similar experiment as support, but as it turned out it was uncertain that one of the three plants as actually a separate species. I am not insinuating that this is the same experiment as I don?t remember the particulars (although I do remember the experiment had something to do with cannabis).
1	Yep life is sometimes incredibly fine tuned. Create and maintain an oddball environment and some existing species will move in or if there is no existing species which can use the environment something may well eventually evolve to do so. Microbes are incredibly efficient at this because of their short generation times. So are things like nematodes etc.
0	I know that the soul exists, which is why I made my claim. Just as sin isn't a man made concept but a reality that is proven whenever you feel guilty for doing wrong. I mean only sociopaths feel no guilt when sinning, are you saying that you're a sociopath?  What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year?
1	In what universe is there a right to murder?  Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.  And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.  What certain activities are forbidden in public?  Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.  And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.

You are truly one confused individual if you can't tell there's a distinct difference between a living thing and a nonliving thing -- that non-living things are missing something that living things have.... Just because this difference cannot be analyzed, measured or defined does not mean it's not there. You can't analyze or define your thought patterns, dreams, brainwaves or consciousness either -- but that does not mean they aren't there. I think you've lost it -- You may very well belong in a mental facility.

The chart is under the international section on the website.What is considered "emergency contraception" as stated on the chart?Didn't PP perform 213,026 abortions in 2001? In 2002 the number of abortions they performed actually increased right?You say that "by number of people" the "main business" of PP is offering contraception and sex ed. What is their "main business" by revenue?

Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars, do we demand that information has a 'sender'?And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information' has a sender and recipient, genetic material has...neither. It's just chemicals and forces. Nothing more. There is no identifiable 'sender', and there is no identifiable 'recipient'. Sure, you can chuck a god in here or there if you like, but that's not where the evidence leads. DNA is not a code, DNA is certainly not a 'language', and it only falls under the definition of 'information' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does.
1	Uh oh, Mr. Poe's proclamation crashes and burns right there - the Bible says no such thing. This is where a Â“satireÂ” quickly changes from something that starts out as mocking, (designed to be something that could be innocence) to a complete lie. It never takes long for atheist satirists to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of the Bible. Atheist mockers donÂ’t seem to be quite as skilled as Mr Poe would have us believe.
1	Following the original purpose of this thread, I will summarize my own views on abortion. (Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called "Survey of views on abortion"):For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the control over one's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one's will. Some may say that, in agreeing to have sex, a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy, but I strongly disagree. A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used. It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood. The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women, religious or non-religious, conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons. Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts. So, women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex. In the case of unwanted pregnancies, it is a significant burden that they never agreed to. If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy, it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies.On the other hand, one has the rights of the fetus. What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities. For me, the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind. I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others. My view is that, once a mental existence begins, the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother's rights over her own body, under most circumstances. The neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester. Therefore, I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester. For that third trimester, I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother's life or physical or mental health (ex. leading to, say, paralysis or strong possibility of suicide, etc.) and, in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late, to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer (i.e. mercy killing). Otherwise, I believe abortions should be restricted. If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester, she should have to carry the pregnancy to term (minus the perviously mentioned exceptions). She would have had ample time to decide.Lastly, here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&id=162
1	Let's hear more. Remember; it is estimated that over 6 billion people were on earth at the time of the flood.  Also, Genesis 1 : 6 thru 1 : 10 - Water was above and below the firmament of Heaven. What happened to the waters that were above the firmament? Was this used for the deluge that covered the earth?  It had never rained before The Flood. Why, if someone made up this story, would they have said such a thing? Wouldn't it be much more believeable if they would have said,  There had never been such a rain as this... ?
0	When treating a woman, her situation is taken into account instead of a black-and-white "Its a life must protect" attitude. It seems more compassionate to consider the situation of the patient, instead of making arbitrary rules.
0	Identity, or personality. A fetus doesn't have either. You need a mind to have either as well.Anyways. This entire thread is just being redundant.

0	Anti abortion people want to take a womens right to an abortion away period. Would you force someone to get a sonagram of a tumor and be forced to look at it and think "do I really want to have this tumor removed?" That is exactly what a fetus is and for some women that is how it is viewed.
0	No.  Do you think the government has the right to defend people from subjective harm?  Under that principle, I can write a book and someone can say,  This book makes me angry and hurts my feelings,  and the book would be banned. People will abuse the  subjective harm  principle to pass off all opinions they don't agree with as harmful.  So what if Terral03 speaks rudely? All it does is make him look bad.

1	Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated. If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.  Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea. Thefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators, although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts. Why's that?  What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?
1	Because...  1) that Texas has a higher rate of violent crime? 2) that Texas fails to prevent such crimes? 3) that Texas sees a huge fisical deficit from such cases?  Strange sense of honor you got there.
1	Well, that is PART of the Scientific Theory of Evolution. There is more to the Scientific Theory, such as adaptation to local changes in the environment and the ability to use new niches and so on.
0	Why is there this onus on the man to do everything? As I said before, it is just as much the woman's choice to have unprotected sex as it is the mans - if this is not the case, then it is already covered by rape laws. By your proposition, only the man need worry about birth control - the woman has no legal necessity to do so at all.  It's not a case that 'the man did the deed' - both parties are potentially just as culpable. If you're going to introduce legal consequences for abortion, they are going to have to affect all the guilty parties; the woman included.  However, personally I would argue against adding further legal restrictions to abortion.
1	So for example if I say "you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are "a part" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.
1	Where to start with this proposal? First such a plan could lead to DC style gun control where you could only own a handgun if it was registered with the city, and then they could immediately halt any and all registration at any time, creating a de facto ban.Then there's the fact that supporters of gun control have argued that gun owners should be required to pay a fee for each gun they register, and that the registration process should be something that needs to be repeated every single year, and the fee paid every time as well.Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason, meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the "only registered guns are legal guns" policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture.And then there's the fact that registration leads to confiscation. We've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago, we know it's the outright truth. Not long after the New York spree killing, the newspaper covering the proposal of gun licenses needing to be renewed every five years explicitly stated that if the registration lapsed the guns would be confiscated.And then there's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits, Canada has stated such. Any attempt at a database is going to waste taxpayer money, take police off the streets, and require police to prosecute honest people for paperwork errors rather than going after gang members and other criminals.Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons, leaving them untraceable!
1	What good is that when most cases involving firearms offenses never make it to the full court? Anytime you have the potential to put somebody away for a great many years because they have a felony record and were arrested and in possession of a gun, the possession charges always get dropped and a plea deal is offered.
1	It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.
1	And the mall plainly had  no guns allowed  signs displayed at all the entrances, meaning the shooter broke the law when he brought his gun in and started shooting.  Now, find me a school massacre that took place where concealed carry is actually legal on campus.
1	600? Oh really? Looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time. Making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic. The fact that there aren't specifics is a key failure in your argument. If the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate, terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere, yet they are not. You are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is. Once again, anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition.
1	And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a  high powered rifle  despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?  And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!  Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics.

1	Whether this has anything to do with marriage or not, it is deplorable that A PERSON who loves another person should be denied a hospital visit for any reason other than concerns related to health. The hospital staff erred in denying the visits, especially those of the children. The denial of the partner's bedside visit is also deplorable. There is no legitimate reason to deny a peaceful visit from any friend or family member to the bedside of a dying person unless it would negatively affect the health and well being of either party. If it positively affects the health and well being of either of them, it should certainly be permitted.  I think the hospital staff should be chastised and punished to the point of remembering this incident forever as a reason to relax their prejudices and get with the program. There is nothing wrong with gay/lesbian people that love and understanding cannot cure.

1	Halton Arp is far from suppressed.Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.I'd say that if he is "suppressed" then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his "fireworks" universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this. But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these "weird" redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away. The ones that can't are just curiosities. Then there isn't a systematic way to look for these things, so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching, which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time.
1	Daley hasn't done anything to effectively combat the infestation of violent gangs and drug dealers within his city. It's now reached the level that Chicago is the most violent and deadly city in all of Illinois. The police are overwhelmed and underfunded, the people are sitting ducks, people are being shot to death in night clubs, and the city isn't so much as lifting a finger otherwise.  This is a disaster, the police are overwhelmed. And if we've gotta let the military open fire on the violent gangs to help restore order, then so be it! Kill the cancer or let it kill you.

0	Careful Brady. It was passage of the 94 ban that lead to the democrats losing the majority of their seats in the house and senate for over a decade.More people than ever are buying guns, including many first timers, because they know Obama will support whatever gun control gets through congress, and they don't like that. They know he's going to go back on his promises to hunters and sportsmen, and that's going to cost him big in 2012. This is going to be a very short reign for the democrats.
0	I think the history of discrimination against gays does count as oppression.Being classified as a "mental illness" with cures that could possibly involve shock "therapy", castration, or lobotomies, having our sex be illegal, the type of harassment we have seen which should make any civilized person blush...I understand you think the "oppression" could be worse, but quite frankly how many minority groups have undergone what gays have undergone? I mean, there is no competing with the atrocities committed against the blacks, and millions of Jews died in the holocaust (along with gay people), but what more is required before you can look at gay history and not see it as "oppression"?

Behe is happy to think that it is the christian god (like the rest of them), but they arn't allowed to say that, because if they do, they violate that annoying ammendment!  The ID argument is not scientific, because it's not falsifiable, and has no supporting evidence. The ID movement relies solely on LACK of evidence for evolution, which is complete bunk. Just because we don't know yet, it doesn't mean that godditit. (Incedentally, most of Behe's claims of  Irreducible Complexity  are already destroyed by science, as DamEtel will be more than happy to explain.)

Not only that, but the resulting offspring is a combination of the features and characteristics of the two parents who copulated. To imply that an unborn child is not human/a person simply because it isn't fully developed is to also claim that a person born without limbs must not be human either because they too are incomplete human beings.

1	I've examined Hall's papers and they make interesting reading. However, further research, including some undertaken by Hall himself, has informed the debate greatly.For one thing, many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation (your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response') as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis. The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit, correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant. The articles I've already cited, though they focus on the Cairns system's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception, also include Hall's work in their assessment.Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants, acknowledging that a colleague's suggestion, that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct. In short, though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes, it is not always an organismic response (eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes), and the 'successful' mutants do not always, or even mostly, arise from within that subpopulation. Also, you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress. It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically (as well as empirically, as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate) not a prerequisite for evolution. It's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case, the environment's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change.

1	And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically (read: deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with (for example) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time) in order to work.

1	I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.

Engineers, mathematicians, medical field..military... etc. No, it's not useful for the common virginia mountain-fur trader.Natural Selection is important in any biological field. To say it's useless is absurd, for it's one of the prime foundations for ALL of Biology.

Probably yes, there had been a change of opinion due to change in justices than they would have found reasons to overturn it already, since they haven't they most likely agree.
1	Hummm, student athletes not all students. They got big problems.
1	Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.

1	So it's not safe to go to school because your teacher might kill you if you're late at turning in your homework?Incidents such as the shooter professor are incredibly rare; you'll find very few school teachers that were convicted of murder during a previous date, and released from prison due to a favor from a politician.But incidents like the one in the UK, where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim, are far more common and close to the norm for the country. If you're attacked, you're guilty if you fight back and cause either harm or fear to the person attacking you. Even if they assault you with a deadly weapon, you're the guilty party if you manage to cause them any sort of harm.
1	Well, I was kind of hoping that my questioning would encourage you to provide a quote to show us exactly what Dembski himself said, but I guess I wasnÂ’t blunt enough.  YouÂ’ve now made it clear that your claim Â– which is still unsupported Â– is that Dembski says a fourth law of thermodynamics, and not the fourth law of thermodynamics. But that still would not necessarily make Dembski wrong.  Does DembkiÂ’s wording show he means a fourth law-of-thermodynamics, or a fourth-law-of-thermodynamics? The first would be wrong but the second would be right.  To try to make this clearer:  ..... We have a zeroth law of thermodynamics.  ..... We have a first law of thermodynamics.  ..... We have a second law of thermodynamics.  ..... We have a third law of thermodynamics.  ..... Dembski claims to have uncovered a fourth law of the thermodynamics.  If his actual statements can be read in that sense, then his claiming to have come up with a fourth law of thermodynamics does not show ignorance, on his part, of their already being 4 laws of thermodynamics.  And as I suggested in my post, here is Stuart Kauffman, who is clearly neither a Creationist nor an ID Creationist, speaking of his attempts to uncover a fourth law of thermodynamics...

And, I'd better not slight the Japanese in this discussion.I'm not sure I approve of Hayek's take on capitalism, though.

Nor are members of any group specifically targeted for abortion. The practice in open to all in the US.Sorry. But all that shows is an abundant level of ignorance.Now, if you can show that abortion is only used to cull the Romany populations in East Europe...then you may have a point.

1	30 million Russian citizens killed.5-12 million German citizens (depending on the source you read) along with 6 million Jewish people killed.An estimated 100 million Chinese citizens killed.20 million Africans killed in various countries in Africa.2 million Cambodians slaughtered.This is just the first 5 off the top of my head that occured in the world during the 20th Century. All occured after sweeping gun control took place and forced disarmament of citizens.In America, every state that has enacted restrictive gun control has seen an increase in crime, police brutality, questionable law enforcement practices such as violations of 4th amendment rights and so on. Washington DC enacted a total handgun ban in 1976, if you look at the crime rate reports from the years before and the years after that took effect, the truth is very telling. In Britain and Australia, both nations enacted sweeping gun bans and forced confiscation. The crime rates of both nations has skyrocketed. Violent crime has especially increased in both countries as criminals realize they have little to fear from their victims now. Reports of police brutality in both nations is on the rise. A consequence of the gun ban in Britain is the repeal of their guarantee of a quick and fair trial. This bit of legislation basically allows a suspect to be held indefinitely without a trial or even being notified of the crimes he or she is accused of. For a very telling reason against gun control, I recommend you watch the UN Gun Debate between Rebecca Peters and Wayne LaPierre. Then, examine the international poll results online from the debate. Gun control kills. History has proven this over and over again. I know that some gun control advocates have the best of intentions at heart but what they fail to realize is that by opening that door, they allow those with less than the best intentions to take advantage of the situation. This is exactly what Hitler did in 1938. He took advantage of the 1935 gun control act of Germany. He used it to find his enemies and eliminate them. Is over 150 million victims of gun control reason enough for you? It is for me.Mike
0	good thing this argument has never been done!...oh wait.  With that logic we should make everything legal. You are much better off making theft legal and safe (no more guns needed!) than to have it illegal and dangerous.
0	Very well said.  However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights.  However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense.
0	Nah I'm not debating this. I'm trying to show that this debate doesn't really prove anything. But I'm sure you can get the names of those who are willing to debate this and look them up in the future if you ever want an easy debate victory
1	If you can't eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply.
1	I realize you said "the jury is still out", which indicates that if I present evidence for one side, that does not settle it: especially if the statement is some 15 years old. However, the quote is fairly relevant and I know right where to find it, so what the heck not post it.
0	It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!
0	It is?If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?Is faith some innate human tendency?It could be seeing as how there is the "god spot" in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.Then again, kids are scared of the dark...
1	But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on.
1	But a scientist makes his bones by clashing with what people want to hear and being correct. Eventually, if enough supportive evidence is accumulated, then old theories are overthrown. The problem with creationism is that there is no theory and there isn't a single thread of supportive evidence.
1	You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.
1	You state  the woman comes first . This seems to be your only  absolute . Why does the woman come first? Is it because she is fully developed? Is she more important than the child she is carrying?
1	Actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. This is illegal. You can't make it more illegal than it already is. Shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around. Nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around. Many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law.As far as puncture wounds, do stabbings count?Or, as it appears, are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?
1	So you think that only the sentence structure needs to be examined and not the meaning of the words?  The courts have the legal authority to interpret the second amendment, not Journalism teachers. And I don't think that you can totally disregard what historians say. This is an matter in which fields of expertise overlap.
1	Read the entire verse and don't edit out parts of it."When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace.

Hmmmm...death or slavery. Wow, that's a hard choice.
0	First off, God is asinine enough to kill what your ilk calls "innocent foetuses", etc., so I wouldn't put anything past him.Secondly, I see you are falling into the usual O.P. of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard "n" is right next to "b" last time I checked). Really Phyllis, get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors.

1	In 2000, the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides. The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year. In Japan, the number was 22.sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan.
1	"refuted?"O'rly? First they start off defining evolution as "moleclues to man" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded. And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones. The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.
0	Well sigma, which is more painful??  Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....

It has just as much feeling as the mother.

0	That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X.
1	Why is there this onus on the man to do everything? As I said before, it is just as much the woman's choice to have unprotected sex as it is the mans - if this is not the case, then it is already covered by rape laws. By your proposition, only the man need worry about birth control - the woman has no legal necessity to do so at all.It's not a case that 'the man did the deed' - both parties are potentially just as culpable. If you're going to introduce legal consequences for abortion, they are going to have to affect all the guilty parties; the woman included. However, personally I would argue against adding further legal restrictions to abortion.
0	Good points IMHO. I think you are holding your own here. But I want to read your views on how your detailed analyses can make a real difference.  There are many with pre-conceived notions about evolution they learned in high-school, so changing opinions is not easy.  Your ideas would really be a help here.  Thanks
1	The court followed the idea of not changing the game after it has been played. They changed the law, but they wont undo what had been done before the law change. For example, say the changed the fine for speeding to 10,000 dollars. People who had already been given speeding tickets would not be fined more money.  People who were married before prop 8 did so completely legally. The law has been changed, but the act of marrying that they performed was legal at the time it was performed, so it would be wrong to undo that.
1	What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper &amp; deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -  until, as you said: Hopefully, the person  finds some way of forgiving themselves , right.  But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research &amp; quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.  Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.  Annie
0	Yes they are. Original source documents are much better for debating the bill then secondary sources, but it requires more effort and alot more energy.  Personally, I haven't a clue as to what the bill is, but the more original documents the better.
1	Why you quoted me is questionable. What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of ****. How you consider mathematical equations "mockery" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video. Instead, in your normal fashion, you simply ASSUMED what you wanted to believe and then went from there rather then actually looking at what it was and what it had to say. Your post more accurately is towards the link that AA posted in defense of his beliefs (yet failed to realize was satirizing those beliefs). Furthermore, I'm not an atheist even though your poor definition wants me to be.
1	Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?

His being so vocal about it is probably the dumbest thing he could do. This guy is not playing with a very bright bulb.

Some of these christian folk have their priorities so twisted it makes me sick.
0	Yes. Oddly, the picture makes as much sense as most creationists.

But be they whites,Blacks,Reds,or pi** purple shoot a few that try to detain or threaten you, yeah I think they will back off unless they are prepared to go to war.
1	Well, the question I am asking is for you to provide a valid scientific prediction based on creationism.
1	There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it?
0	The NRA represents a minority that screeches very loudly. Most Americans want more gun control.  http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/.../12/poll.guns/  And most gun owners don't belong to the NRA.
0	I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.
1	Well that was a lovely story and cudos on working in the anti-war angle.  No, the 50 or more GIANT posters in a row alongside a public (taxpayer funded) roadway do not affect me personaly in any way from a shock perspective. As I said, I am strongly against abortion, I have seen the same pictures many times before.  My complaint is the virtual forcing of all citizens to view the photos as they drive down a public roadway, and the harrassing of motorists at stop lights.  Mainly my point in posting this thread was to try to find out if this was a common type of anti-abortion protest in other parts of the country. I'm quite sure many other  conservatives  will view this type of protest as a wonderful thing. I think it actually works against the anti-abortion movement and alienates potential supporters.
0	A master baiter like you should present your thesis to be taken seriously, you haven't and you aren't.
0	And you do what many atheists do when they don't know what else to say, you clang the fallacy bell.
1	You are absolutely correct. Scientists do science. Philosophers wander around inside their own domain. On the other hand I am much more interested in the scientific merits of NDS and EAM than in the musings of philosophers. Science supports NDS, science fails to support the vitalist views of EAM. Simple as that. Its not a philosophical issue, its a scientific one.

1	An interesting analysis of that article you keep quoting from the World Net Daily. http://www.saneguns.org/commentary/comment002.html
1	None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about  information  or something.
1	you're on the right track; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is, mutations (which supposedly add new raw material for selection) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure. It's a sad fact for evos.
1	But not all "designs" are manufactured. Take the repetitive ridges of sand on a beach. They are created by the motion of the water. Shall I remind you of the humorous story about the "image of Jesus" that attracted much attention, yet turned out to be a coincidence of shadows? This is why I insist upon your defining the terms you're using.
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.
1	The photoautotrophic ones do.
0	I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few.
1	Again you focus on irrelevant minutia in the hope of making excuses and justifying the actions of someone who was clearly in the wrong. Here again is what the Judges said in their ruling, one being a fellow woman whom you are calling a racist, and it doesn't bode well for your law suit partial criminal: But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: "It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation."
1	Again that is a poor analogy. Congress does not have any powers NOT included in the Constitution. Quite the opposite, it specifically says that any powers NOT included in the Constitution is defaulted to the states and Congress is additionally prohibited from taking any more authority NOT named in the Constitution.Since there is no specific naming article saying Congress does not have the power to ban manufacturing weapons, in fact it DOES NOT. According to the 10th Amendment:The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.Thus you have another poor analogy. Congress DOES NOT have the right to ban manufacture of guns.
1	You also make choices when it comes to morality. You say that you value human life, yet you support the death penalty. Presumably, you might support killing the enemy during times of war, you might accept the fact that there is "collater damage" during war of innocent civilians, you might support killing in self-defense, etc. There are many balances that are made in our moral choices. Should I start claiming that your standard is getting ever more complicated when it comes to valuing human life?The abortion debate is a debate about a specific set of circumstances. In those circumstances, I claim that the fetus gets rights to life (outbalancing the mother's rights to her own body) after it can gain mental existence (around the third trimester) and you claim that it gains rights from conception on. Outside of that specific set of circumstances then we encounter other considerations and, yes, things get more complicated.In the abortion debate there are only two living beings to consider - the mother and the fetus and their relative rights and value. If you step outside of the abortion debate, then many other things start coming into play, complicating not only the moral picture which I present but the moral picture which you present as well. So, perhaps we should just stick with the debate of this forum - namely, abortion. I am regretting bringing up this thread because it is straying too far afield of the topic of this forum - abortion.
1	Me neither. I do know it's a funny thing to watch SS say such things despite having his own belief shot, bagged, tagged and buried
0	If the 2nd is out of date, then lets do away with free speech, fair trials, and rights against cruel and unusual punishment. After all, these are all out of date after over 230 years. Or are you saying  I only want to ban the amendments that I don't like ? Your argument lacks some logic.  I wouln't call it  self defence  so much as I would call it  hiding and letting crooks trample all over you.   What kind of  gun crime  are you refering to?  Correction: they need not fear a citizens militia as long as they don't pass unjust laws.  Better safe than sorry.
1	There is a pretty huge difference.Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.
1	I think you're mixing up socialist and fascist. Patriotism is anathema to socialism.
1	MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES  Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word Â“carryÂ”Â–a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English DictionaryÂ’s twenty-sixth definition of Â“carryÂ” is Â“bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.Â” 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. WebsterÂ’s defines Â“carryÂ” as Â“to move while supporting,Â” not just in a vehicle, but also Â“in oneÂ’s hands or arms.Â” WebsterÂ’s Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And BlackÂ’s Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase Â“carry arms or weaponsÂ” as  Â“To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.Â” BlackÂ’s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).  These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the Â“carrying of armsÂ” to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person Â“carries a weapon.Â” But to say that is not to deny that one may also Â“carry a weaponÂ” tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.  Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word Â“carriesÂ” in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of Â“carry,Â” a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column Â“carriesÂ” the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921.

Big question mark!My point is that - the lizard was designed to survive in a neighborhood where eating leaves, was its best chance of survival. So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go. Having the built-in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat.
0	oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.
1	No need to change the verbage:   ...individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments.   Like folks who migrated to northern latitudes and happened to have lighter skin(variation) were healthier and therefore produced more and healthier offspring. Over generations the lighter skinned came to dominate the group while becomming lighter still. Why is that so difficult? No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced. They just weren't as successful in the long run.
1	Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max.
1	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.
1	So to be safe lest say that there 100 million more approved NICS checks.  We also know that More (People) seek concealed weapons permits  And we know that all through the 90's, more and more states allowing people to possess handgun licenses, and more and more people in those states are carrying! And we know that All but 2 states now having some kind of concealed carry laws.  Crime in the United States - by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989Â–2008

WHen is building your product to comply with the law 'circumventing the law?' Should we ban SUV's because when laws were put on to increase fuel mileage, the car manufactures made them get better gas mileage?

1	Interesting how the study was set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They're a city known for violence and gang-related issues. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if those that were shot and counted in this "study" were known gang members who were either shot by their intended victims, or by other rival gang members.
1	They can if they're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church.
1	Because bibliolaty doesn't equal Christianity. There are two issues here:1) many may worship Christ through analysis of sources of his life and/or the inspiration of the holy spirit without believing all of the Bible is valid in any sense2) many who do accept the totality of the Bible as meaningful are aware of the huge amount of metaphor, poetry etc. in it. Is everything to be seen as from God's point of view? Are the Psalms and Song of Solomon not powerful and illuminating human expressions of love and faith?
1	It was a fair question for Tim to ask, even your beloved NRA web-site has the 2nd Amendment located in top-right. (http://www.nraila.com/issues/FactSheets/)  How does the law of contract explicitly protect your right to carry a gun?  Are you allowed to shoot someone if they breach a contract?  What about torts laws? - where a contract doesn't exist.
1	No they're not....do zoos document the changes in phenotype that no-doubt occur? This is not the zoo's job -- their job is not experimentation on animals -- that's science's job. Besides that, zoos do their darndest to house the animals in habitats that mimic the animals' natural settings.SS: 2) Show me one instance of science testing/disproving lamarckian-style inheritance.
1	Science is not all knowledge , it does not have the answer for everything that is the religion of scientism that believes that. Science means to know but it does not know everything. It is a wonderful tool not the meaning of life.
1	Yes, a foetus is human, made of human cells, and possessing of DNA. However, it is no more a person than my kidney. Personhood implies mental existance, something foetuses do not have before the end of the 2nd trimester.
0	Just for the sake of argument, let's assume evolutionists had trouble explaining away the tongue of the woodpecker. How in any sense is creationism the alternative?  No explanation therefore God. What bloody rubbish. And why do the same people keep posting the same crapola on different sites under different names? Ah, yes. Created without a brain. The only logical non-evolutionary explanation.
1	Actually it isn't. No, really, it isn't; I'm not making this up; I think you've genuinely crossed a wire somewhere there.Traits are partially described by genes; they're the starting point - as you once put it, the 'hard drive' - but the process of turning genes into an organism is unquestionably influenced by the environment - chemically, thermally etc etc. That's one reason frogs need so damn many genes while placental animals can get away with a lot fewer: frogspawn have to tolerate such widely varying temperatures during development and need proteins that work correctly at all those temperatures, whereas mammalian foetuses develop in a chemically and thermally regulated environment.Weismann's barrier says only that hereditary information moves from genes to body cells but never in reverse. The genes provide the starting point, the developmental process - modulated by environmental factors - turns that information into an organism, but there's no feedback. Retroviruses might constitute a hole in that barrier, which opens up some interesting possibilities.Anyway, the point is, the ToE as it stands does not say, in any shape or form, that genes alone dictate traits and nothing else gets a look in. What it does say is that although the environment can modulate the eventual phenotype during development, it can't directly feed back the results of expressing those genes to the genotype. The environment can only have an indirect 'say' in the genotype of organisms, by allowing some to flourish and inhibiting the success of others.That's why, in the other thread where we're discussing the butterflies, I describe the Darwinian process of arriving at environmental sensitivity in the way I do: the environment modulates the phenotype differently in the different seasons (based on chemical or thermal variation) and Natural Selection, in this case, is the organisms with genes that consistently yield the 'best' phenotypes in that variable environment flourishing better. Simmer for a couple of million years and... well, there you go.
1	Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called  womens issuses  be in valid?
1	Well let's see, from your "EvC Forum" link;
1	I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).  It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.  However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being.
1	Since when does the fate get decided by the victim? A woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party. Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision.

0	That's great for women!  What about the rights of their children?
0	Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.  (Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)
1	We're all addicted to something. I had a tough time recently giving up coffee.It was interfering with my life. It was making me feel like XXXX, I couldn't sleep right, my bowels were out of whack, but I couldn't just stop cold turkey. I tried, but I got these really bad headaches and my whole body felt like XXX. It was hell at work, my head felt like it was going to explode and I was achy all the time. I had to gradually wean myself from it. Now I drink tea which has less caffiene but I still sometimes feel like I have to have it. Since I've cut down (I don't think I've really gotten totally over my caffiene addiction)I fell so much better. I have more energy during the day, I don't wake up half dead desperately needing a quad espresso. 
0	Holy Moles! Chloe! This is absolutely the worst analogy you could possibly use.Jeepers creepers! Do you have absolutely any sense at all of history?It was the RULE for RICH CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN EUROPE NOT TO BREASTFEED THEIR BABIES BECAUSE IT WOULD THEM SEXUALLY UNATTRACTIVE TO THEIR RICH CHRISTIAN HUSBANDS!!! A poor woman was usually hired to serve as a wetnurse for said child--and I certainly hope that the children of that poor woman did not suffer as a result of the poor woman's economic need to serve as a wetnurse for a RICH CHRISTIAN WOMAN'S CHILD, but you can be very sure that THE RICH CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND HER RICH, DEMANDING CHRISTIAN HUSBAND DID NOT GIVE A FLYING FARK ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THE poor woman's children!

1	Well, sure there are, and to say that laws based on the Bible don't exist is to deny reality. You might be surprised to know that around 3/4s of our states have blue laws on their books(http://college.hmco.com/history/read...0_bluelaws.htm), some in  liberal  New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut). They're probably not ever enforced, but they're there.  At one time laws against blaspheming were common. There were laws against swearing in public. Lots of things. Religion and the Bible has long had a profound effect on law in this country.
1	And of course, the Vulgate
1	Hey, bring it on. A month ago, I read over your 'failed prophecies' and if you are ready to listen, there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt.It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes, but the long and short of it is this: you don't even begin to know the God you are dealing with. If you give me a space of time to get things together, I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you're his "buddy" then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses (Ps. 50)Here's a hint though about what happened in Egypt: God changed his mind. But you didn't know he could do that? You would be surprised how much like you he really is. He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible: Abraham tried to get Him to but couldn't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, God was out to kill Moses' sons, but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind, also Moses succeeded in changing God's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites, God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented, God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins, I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them. But be careful - when He is set on doing something, it gets done. Just when you think you have a "pal" in God, he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel: when a land sins against Me, though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it, they will deliver but their own souls.Even righteous Noah couldn't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world. Real quick: one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king. Happens time and time again in scripture. Don't have time to elaborate right now. Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations. So while God is using him to punish Egypt, He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well. Get it? Is it too mature for you? Don't believe it? Too bad....it's true. God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations. When He is through using them, He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original "servant" so to speak. This is mature teaching. Most Christians don't like it. Too bad....it's true. You don't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day. One day, He will be finished with you as well. Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this (God is speaking): All these things you have done and I kept silent. You thought I was altogether like you, but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces. Ps 50:21Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy?' God changed His mind! Maybe you ought to start praying that He will change His mind about your destiny as well.
1	Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical?

1	How is it a sin to exercise your constitutional rights? Why should the law-abiding have to pay such a tax? Why not let the criminals pay the tax since they're the ones who break the law?
0	I think that this is my view of it all as well. A lot of the events of the bible (mainly the old testament) are things that might have occured in one form or another, and much of the events of the New Testament DID occur.An example of my view is that I think that the flood did happen. It all started as a very large flood (probably in a river valley) that was much larger than normal (say a "500-year-flood" or a larger discharge event), possibly destroying a bunch of dwellings and maybe killing a lot of people, but some surviving leading to the Noah character. Eventually over the millenia, it got distorted and blown well out of proportion until it became a flood that covered the entire world. Then it led to the Epic of Gilgmesh, which was then adopted by those writing the early books of the Bible under the form it is seen as today.
1	By definition is undefinable?So then God you cannot claim that god is: loving, good, omnipotent, ominiscent, etc....Or do you claim such.Again I ask you describe what it is that you believe in?Is your answer than you believe in the undefinable of which you do not know any further?
1	Well, PR on both sides will probably be gearing up on this, so which ever side does have the correct legal interpretation will probably be broadcasting it pretty soon now. It'll just be a matter of seperating the real answers from the bogus ones. Given how politcal the issue is I'm not going to accept any claims for correctness that don't cite actual specific law. As opposed, for example, to Romney simply saying  the constitution says they gotta .

0	The definition of manslaughter is when one's actions, which end up killing someone, display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation. That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.I'm not saying "miscarriage is not manslaughter," but only "miscarriage is not always manslaughter." For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the "you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter. So obviously, miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of "every instance of A is an instance of B."

1	We've said that it is living, but that it wasn't a life.
1	Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a "curious relationship in the numbers." Go back to that thread and read the study. If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

First a biased claim repeated on Yahoo from canned propaganda source, VPC with a few quotes from staunch marxists that would like to ignore the Second Amendment and the entire Constitution, then you include the suppositions and dire warnings which have never come true but you are not finished yet. Your quote contains the usual lies about training and education plus an appeal to interfere with State Rights which 34 States have specifically stated their support of through their State AG. Not enough yet? "well it's a right" is no longer an argument, it is fact. Read Heller v D.C. and the myriad of cases including 35 Supreme Court cases that have always held the Second Amendment protects those individual rights. Even Roe v Wade states the rights found in the BOR such as ..."the right to keep and bear arms" to be a fundamental right.What you have is an unConstitutional right being demeaned by a person who swore an oath to protect and defend it...making them/him a traitor.

We are seeing examples of it today through medicare on a smaller scale than will be practiced once this new program is enacted if we allow it to be.

1	The ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and Constitutionally weak ground that Congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years. It expires this year.The right to own arms is expressly clear. It shall not be infringed by Congress. The federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons, it does not have the power to limit them from citizens.Those people who "you don't know (what they may do)"? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so, then we no longer live in a free society. Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law. It cuts both ways, you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free. The only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police. The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime, they recall "back in the day" how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey. Yes they were safe from criminals, they were not safe from the secret police. The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy, you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again.The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership. Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this. Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.Some points I have for you:1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:"Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy." - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htmFlash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security. If public policy productive and actally do something, then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce.3) Bayonet? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons. Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned. Will someone please let me know? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy.4) Pistol grip? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target. Well then, if you rifle is semi-auto, then what reason is there to ban them?

1	Well nothing, other than the fact that I don't believe it to be true!  But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.  I don't see why not, it appears the most logical explanation to me.  You are right, it's not a nice thought. But then again little in life is. Why should this be any different?

1	Another relevant study:   Major findings: States with higher levels of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm homicide and overall homicide. This relationship held for both genders and all age groups, after accounting for rates of aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, urbanization, alcohol consumption, and resource deprivation (e.g., poverty). There was no association between gun prevalence and non-firearm homicide.  Publication: Miller, Matthew; Azrael, Deborah; Hemenway, David.

1	Won't work. "danger to the mother's life" has to cover allowing an abortion if there is a significant risk of psychological damage which might lead to suicide. Any doctor, especially in a country like yours with a runaway litigation culture, faced with "I will kill myself and the baby if you don't abort" will decide there is a significant risk (to his wallet mainly). It is for this reason that "convenience abortions" are technically illegal here in the UK, but they occur anyway.
1	No argument there. I wasn't asked if I wanted my federal tax dollars to go towards same sex benefits in violation of DOMA. :xcensored
0	Atheists tend to ignore information they don't like also.
1	But this is not the end of the story. The news about gun accidents has gotten even better! Today's Gun Accident Rates Lowest On Record
1	No, she misrepresented studies and took statistics out of context. Very right-wing. She asked how we would feel if we were killed. The fact that we have consciousness, awareness of ourselves(sentience) makes us different from the fetus during the level of development when the vast majority of abortions occur.
0	And by old fashion I assume you mean Greece a couple of thousand years ago. That's the only place and time I can think of off hand where the populace (by which I mean landed men in this case) could vote to change laws. In this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law is via the courts, and always has been.  However, I don't think that is, in fact, what Jyoshu was refering to.
1	Except during rape.

1	You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance.
1	Natural Selection (plus genetic variation).
1	Last I checked, drug prohibition began much earlier than the 1980s. The '80s fall in violent crime is more likely a result of the legalization of abortion than it is a result of the  success of the war on drugs. 
1	Actually, not at all true. The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals. It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics. For example, the cordates first arise in the early Cambrian, along with primitive inverebrates. You can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then. For example, there were no amphibians, no reptiles, no insects, no birds, and of course, no mammals.Your shotgun approach isn't actually worth answering in any detail. It isn't even your work.
1	Among other things, the newborn must obtain its own oxygen and its own nourishment. It must also transition from an aquatic environment to an aerobic one.  Those are significant enough changes in and of themselves as to be transforming.  Be that as it may, the central question still remains.  Who is better able to determine the future of a particular woman's pregnancy, the nanny state or the woman herself?  All other issues are subordinated to that one.
0	Well, I'm not sure if he consumed alcohol or not, but his doctor gave him daily  vitamin  shots that contained vitamins as well as amphetamines and maybe other drugs that doctors at the time thought were mentally beneficial.  And I've never heard of him being a vegetarian.  I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite, but I don't think they mentioned his being a veggie.  I don't see how being a tetotaller and a vegetarian are good characteristics.
0	Yes, Creationist doublespeak at its "best".  Once again creeping Creationism seeks to undermine science in little steps. If this latest inroad is not stopped more will follow, rest assured.
1	Again, how so? If you can grip a tree with a birds foot and climb it while your preadator can't would be a great advantage. Likewise, a predator who can climb trees and get at the food sources up there would have a advantage over your competition.Ostriches and other flightless birds seem to get along just fine with their feet. Why would you say they were suffering from a detriment?
1	And how often has this actually occurred? Maybe there are examples of this actually taking place to warrant it being a problem that needs addressing? Or is this just your own personal belief?

1	Look again, Smith. All those killed in these places, died in a location where they were told they couldn't have a gun with them. More guns weren't a part of the equation, less guns were. There were no guns in these locations except for those illegally brought in by the killers, and those of the police who arrived after it was already too late.Fewer guns aren't the answer, anybody with a dab of common sense would realize that because it's impossible to disarm the bad guys.
1	While it may be true that an ovum is formed during the mother's fetal stage, an ovum is not a unique human entity in and of itself. It does not become a unique human entity until it is fertilized at conception. (Do you like semantics games?) ;)
1	None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about "information" or something.
1	Actually, there's a birth every 8 seconds, and a death every 11 seconds, which means the population of the earth grows less than 1% each year...so, even with those aborted babies, the world would NOT be overpopulated.

0	Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
0	Once again noting how you think that you should be the one to define what evolutionary biologists mean by the words they use. You want to lump all of science that you find in disagreement with you religion under one term, without making an honest effort to understand any of it.
0	I think you are right.  One of my favorite Sidney Harris cartoons was two scientists coming out of a conference presentation, and one, absolutely thrilled, says to the other, "What a wonderful talk - everything we know is wrong!"
1	And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the "Out of Africa" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.
1	Well, it wasn't just a footnote that Lott supposedly lost. It was all his raw data to support his claim that 98% of defensive gun uses don't involve the firing of the weapon. And Lott did lie because changed his story about who conducted the story. "When Lott cited the statistic peripherally on page three of his book, he attributed it to 'national surveys.' In the second edition, he changed the citation to 'a national survey that I conducted.' He has also incorrectly attributed the figure to newspaper polls and Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck."http://www.townhall.com/columnists/m...20030205.shtmlSo was it a newspaper poll? Did Kleck conduct it? Now Lott claims he did it. If true, he must have been lying when he said that others conducted the study. "He has forgotten the names of the students who allegedly helped with the survey and who supposedly dialed thousands of survey respondents long-distance from their own dorm rooms using survey software Lott can't identify or produce."Interesting how he can't remember anyone who helped him."Lott now admits he used a fake persona, 'Mary Rosh,' to post voluminous defenses of his work over the Internet. 'Rosh' gushed that Lott was 'the best professor that I ever had.' She/he also penned an effusive review of 'More Guns, Less Crime' on Amazon.com: "It was very interesting reading and Lott writes very well." (Lott claims that one of his sons posted the review in 'Rosh's' name.) Just last week, 'Rosh' complained on a blog comment board: "Critics such as Lambert and Lindgren ought to slink away and hide." "By itself, there is nothing wrong with using a pseudonym. But Lott's invention of Mary Rosh to praise his own research and blast other scholars is beyond creepy. And it shows his extensive willingness to deceive to protect and promote his work."http://www.townhall.com/columnists/m...20030205.shtml
1	Did these reputable creationists realize that we can measure continental drift?
1	This focus on consciousness as constituting personhood is completely unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. First, a single human varies in consciousness. I have become much more aware of my world as I have aged. Would it be less moral to have killed me as an infant or a child than now at age 39? Or should you wait until I'm a senile 80 year old to minimize the immorality of killing me? Should you wait until I am daydreaming or asleep since I am less a person at those moments?  Second, humans vary from person to person, and even person to animal. Is it moral to kill a person in a coma, a little immoral to kill a retarded person, and the gravest evil to kill a genius? A mature sheepherding dog is more conscious than an infant--does that mean it's more immoral to kill the dog?  Third, consciousness is just subjective experience of all those neurons firing away in the brain, like a lightning show. It is the epiphenomenon of a BIOLOGICAL reality. Twenty-first century people are still like primitives in that they all-too-often think that humans are like disembodied spirits. The truth is that humans are living BODIES. The Left and the Right join hands in superstition on this one. The biology can exist without consciousness; consciousness CANNOT exist without the biology. Therefore, biology has the stronger claim.
1	His point was criticism of people managing the numbers of their population with abortion. It also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations.

0	And you condemn people for dancing in the blood of the victims? That's what you seem to be doing since enough information is not provided to draw any conclusions about the relationship between guns and crime. Weren't these police officers armed? So India should have no gun control laws to disarm dangerous communist rebels? That's you're solution?
1	I'll trust anybody that's not government funded, with a gun. Hell I'd even trust drug dealers sooner than I'd trust the government in terms of being armed. Governments all around the world have killed millions of their own people in genocides after disarming them, proving that government should never be armed.
1	Yes.  (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)
0	Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers.
1	Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood. Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash. Some people have been calling John Lott "the Bellesiles of the Right." Read this article "The Bellesiles of the Right? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data."http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan (Mary Rosh) to praise himself. That's intentionally trying to deceive people. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...&notFound=true
1	And you have just described "creation science." No application of the scientific method. No testing. The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun. I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below. You show that you are what you decry.
1	And depending on what human is "finding the answers" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings.
0	You should have said that. I might have agreed with you.
1	Yup! That's the white morph. Doesn't help your case any.
1	**  Wrong. As always.   The noun atheism has 2 meanings:  Meaning #1: the doctrine or belief that there is no God  Synonym: godlessness  Antonym: theism (meaning #1) [bold added]  Meaning #2: a lack of belief in the existence of God or gods  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **  A  doctrine  is--   A principle or body of principles presented for acceptance or belief, as by a religious, political, scientific, or philosophic group; dogma.   answers.com  Thus atheism is a dogmatic statement of belief, just like any other religion. Most people, BTW, know that by affixing the prefix 'a' to a word, you intend that word's contrary. As in, 'historical'/'ahistorical', 'typical'/'atypical', and 'theist/'atheist'.
1	And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.
0	Because evolution is how God created. Sorry, but we can't lie to our kids. We can't tell them creationism is true when God tells us it is false.

0	Well, if they were armed, one of the pirates could possibly be injured. I dunno. I wonder if Mr. and Mrs. Chandler have ever heard of Munir Hussain? I hope they are following the advice the British government has given Myleene Klass."Don't defend yourselves! You might injure an attacker!"
1	Gun registration part of the plan all along
1	One point I would like to make is that rockets are not legal to own, unless they are demil-ed, and the same goes for tanks and aircraft. They are called Destructive Devices under the NFA, and are regulated heavily.
0	Chloe, the point of this thread is to help you understand what the argument is, not to give analogies to abortion.
0	It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.
0	If I'm so pathetic why don't you start debating my on my OP here. by the way, I could care less what evolutionists think of my posting habits. Come to think of it I may go find another board to post on.
0	Why on earth would a woman come out now, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago, when it was illegal, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about?  Why on earth would any woman do that?  When did official medical records become non trustworthy? The conspiracy theories and blinders that both sides are wearing are astounding.  Waxy  P.S. I think the whole thing is repugnant, and any real politicizing of it by the Democrats would be disgusting IMHO. However, Bush did open the door with his strong anti-abortion stance, and sometimes, when you make your bed....
0	But was this recent version of Chritianity exported form America? I know these sorts make us laughingstocks to many in other countries, especially the televangelists.
1	actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....probably upon a pole reversal.
1	Power out. That was a link to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Go back and look later if you want.
1	Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?
1	And what mechanisms are you specifically saying are futile?
0	Then what's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms? Do you fear something in particular? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better?
0	Well stated. Whatever the reason, the new culture of ridicule IS there. When you see the in person comments of Dawkins, Provine, Myers, you'll know where posters here get it from.  I hope you'll watch the movie, and post up what you think.
1	But there is no evidence that it did not come about by natural processes. And, there is, in fact, evidence of natural processes that may have resulted in life. Just because you don't understand it doesn't make it so.
0	Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.  I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.  I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.  We all lead your typical normal life.
1	Since we already had one example of a Creationist lowlife tactic in the George Gaylord Simpson quote, I decided to skim the site and see if I could find another. I did.  Gee, gives the impression that Dr. David M. Raup, Curator of Geology, Museum of Natural History, Chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely one?s belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific.  But that?s not at all what Dr. Raup was stating. While Googling for a fuller quote, I ran across a page that showed how this ? and many other ? statements by Dr. Raup were distorted by Creationists.  To start with, here is a fuller quote:  The page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to Dr. Raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a Creationist journal (one of the quotes being the one being addressed here). Of course Dr. Raup?s reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record, nor evolution, nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution.  The page also lists numerous other Creationist distortions of Dr. Raup's statements.
1	The hypothesis of a mitochondria Eve is about 17 years old and has been shown to be wrong. In addition your statement that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations makes clear you did not understand the concept behind mitochondria Eve to begin with.
0	Actually he is, and he's posted on this thread.  It is a pity that you're unwilling to debate, but endeavour a smear campaign as you did on the Science and Math posts. I would advise you read the above quote before talking again :)
1	So we can't base our definition of  kind  on mere appearances?  I mean if we are going to put things into categories and call the category  kind , we should do this by common appearances. A penguin is in the same kind as a hummingbird, but is a lobster in the same kind as an oyster? Obviously a lobster and a shrimp would be in the same kind, but could a dolphin and a manatee be in the same kind? Did they evolve from a common ancestor kind?  And since apes look and act so much like humans, didn't they just evolve from humans? By all appearances, they we must all be in the same kind.
1	You see the physical manifestations but there's nothing that can be shown that God still cannot cause an earthquake or flood when he wants to. For instance, is he the one who can tweak a continental plate when he wants to, or cause flood-related weather patterns?  See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.
0	Just claim hyperevolution so that the millions of species today (about 5 million named - estimates as high as 30 million) can evolve from the few "kinds" that were able to be on the ark, around 16,000 by most creationist claims.
1	Actually it is more than that. Yes conservatives will be back in power, but I have never seen so much discontent in America period.  I don't know where we got off track but I think it is this. We are Americans, not Democrat or Republican. Our allegiance belongs to the Republic, not to any political group. While we fight and try to score some kind of political points with each and every event, America is burning. Sooner or later, while we bicker endlessly, the American People are going to be fed up with both parties, and move into something yet not discovered.  Heck, the way China is rising in material wealth, and while we mortgage our Children's futures so that we do not have to feel the pain, maybe we will be just presiding over the destruction of the greatest society even known to man.  All of this is possible unless we find the courage to work together for the good of all America, instead of just trying to play got ya with the other party.  It is what I said a few days ago. United we Stand and Divided We Fall!  However, I doubt the Chinese will be anywhere as benevolent as We the People were. But it seems clear that change is coming, but I sincerely doubt that is has very little to do with the kind of change Obama Envisioned!  So belly up to the bar and Get Some discontent Boys! After all we all have earned it!  We reap what we sow!
1	Aside from this being completly wrong, it is quite compelling. You make a good point in regard to an organism's form only making sense in relation to its environment. Of course, this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment. It actually is possible to look at genes without the context of the orginal creature. This is why we can move genes from one organism and place them in another. Given a complete understanding of molecular biology, we could contruct any form of organism we desired from scratch.
1	The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. 
1	 Hanoi  Jane is a disgrace to all Americans.........She should have been tried for treason in 1971......No true Vietnam Vet will ever accept her apology......  I don't condone that vet spitting on her but I don't blame him........  As far as the abortion issue goes there is no God that supports the murder of the innocent unborn in the womb........
0	No, actually it doesn't at all. If that is so, then Popi the sailor man is also the Great  I Am . The Greek for the 'I AM' in John is 'Ego Emni' , while if he wanted to say he was god, it would be 'ego emi ho on' . Do try to understand that you are reading a translation of a translation.  If you bothered to read what the storyline in is about, you know, context, you would see that the writer of the Gospel of John was saying on The father was greater than Jesus. In context, this is saying that Jesus is claiming to be greater than Abraham,  Before  Abraham in priority, not before Abraham in time.  So, your example is null and void. I suspect that due to your ignorance and hate, I will get a flip off answer rather than respond to this point.
1	I'd say no to the first part, and yes to the second. The "information theory" argument is something that gets brought up on forums alot, generally by people who don't know what information theory is, but I've never seen an "official" ID person claim it as a central argument.The basic argument is that stuff, from the universe, to people, to eyeballs, to DNA, is too complex to have "just happened". Someone, (and they won't say God, cause their not trying to be religious here, oh no...) must have designed them.
0	One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord.
0	YES!! Go South Dakota!! emoticon_xbouncer
1	#1 - Evolution continues today. Some organisms evolve relatively quickly. It has and is being observed. Do some research.  #2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena. It must have happened by itself if there is no Creator. There are several theories about the specifics. I happen to think lightning was involved.  #3 - It is thought humans evolved  away  from the other apes due to environmental pressures. When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate. That change in climate forced our ancestors from the trees which somehow contributed to our  rapid  and unprecedented brain development.  #4 - Geology and radioactive isotopes.
1	The fact you always ignore is your not just doing it to your body.....
1	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.
0	It's kind of funny that they claim this happened, but can't get the woman to come out and say it?
1	Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?
1	Actually, I have fired an NFA gun before.
1	Well Ladywolf, that is really more of an argument than it is an honest question. If marriage was truly a private affair that impacted nobody outside the couple themselves, then, yes, that question would be valid. But that is a very shallow understanding and a very uninformed understanding of the nature of marriage, because marriage is just as much — if not more so — about the community as it is about the couple themselves. But it's not the community that gets married.No, it's not the community that gets married, but it's the community that enforces marriage and develops marriage. We need to understand that marriage is just as much a social norm — a social ideal — of the kind of behavior that we expect and need for a healthy vibrant society; as much as it is about the emotional commitment of two people.One of the biggest issues is the social role of marriage. Marriage domesticates men. Men who are not attached permanently to a woman are men that will practice and engage in socially unhealthy behaviors at a much higher level. How will same-sex marriage effect the concept of "marriage"? Marriage becomes reduced down to nothing, because the moral argument for same-sex marriage is the same moral argument for group marriage, for polygamy, and it is going to be impossible to deny polygamous groups — and group marriage people — who come forth in all sincerity and say, "If you can't restrict marriage to only couples of opposite sex, then you can't restrict marriage to only two people." They are all very much interwoven.The three things that you lose are: 1) the domesticating influence of marriage on men; 2) the protective influence of marriage upon women from being victimized and objectified by men; and 3) it provides mothers and fathers for children. When monogamy is lost as an ideal, the idea that a man should commit himself and forego all other sexual relationships but (the one with) his wife, then women become commodities to be used and collected by men. When committing yourself to a woman and subjugating your sexual desires for the sake of that woman — when that becomes just one lifestyle choice among many, it is devastating to a culture.Same-sex "marriage" also denies every child it touches access to either a mother or father. It is never compassionate to intentionally deny a child either a mother or father.
0	Ah, you've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate. Sad, but predictable.   Obviously, I was discussing the entire article, which is making that argument. It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length.
0	I don't think you could say that it would destroy society. That's a different issue, however.  There's that slippery slope fallacy being used countless times, when no one has a logical argument. Have you ever considered that it may be moral to treat gay and lesbian people with equality?
0	If gay marriage were as spelled out in the constitution the way voting is, I might agree with you. But it's not. The best you can do with gay marriage is to make it fit into an amendment that doesn't specifically mention it, that was written about an unrelated issue. With the legality of the issue so vague, what do you expect? If you want to avoid people voting on issues like this, perhaps you should follow historical precedent in dealing with civil rights issues and get an amendment passed that spells it out.
0	But, Michele, it wasn't any where near to killing her. The stipulation of the law, TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER ONLY!!! Otherwise, the pweshious widdo fetus has all priority.
1	Not sure who this was aimed at or even what it's based on, but like Duo Maxwell, I don't have a problem with those that are pro-environment, I consider myself pro-environment.  What I do have a problem with is misinformation and extremism. There's too much of both coming out of the  pro-environment  camp these days IMHO.  Waxy

1	Actually, if you had paid attention, you would know that every example of IR given by Behe has been debunked. Immune system? Sorry. Debunked. There are examples of organisms with intermediate steps. Blood cloting cascade? Sorry. There are example of animals that accomplish clotting without all of the "necessary" factors. Bacerial flagellum? Sorry. Type III secretion systems appears to be a simplified sub-set of the bacterial flagellum's components.If only you took the time to actually educate yourself rather than trying to pass off mythology as reality.

0	With all the debt Obama has generated for our nation, he deserves to be filibustered into the ground. For too long the democrats had absolute power and ran amok and unchecked, answering to absolutely nobody and ignoring the will and the voice of the people.
1	And the state... States can have armies... The people are the Militia.
1	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.

1	If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic. That does not sound logical to me. Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe (I'm not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point). If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them?Just a question. "In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." (Colossians 2:3)
0	Hmmm... so, barren women can not have a valid point of view nor women in the stage of menopause because it does not affect them personally. Perhaps you should tell the moderator to institute women only Forums, men only Forums, gays only Forums.... etc
1	Really? Then give me the definition of evolution. I'm not asking for a statement of theory, or an example of evolution. What is the definition used by evolutionary biologists of evolution? I suspect that you haven't studied evolution.
0	its complex, therefore goddidit
1	actually, human skin is sensitive to light, not to mention nearly all plants are sensitive to light. light sensitive cells are abundant even where there are no eyes. just a tiny bit of reading and youll realise that they didnt "magically" appear.
1	Actually polygamy is about one man marrying more than one woman. It is a heterosexual insitution. By your argument, it is traditional man/woman marriage that is the slippery slope to this "broadening" of marriage. You do not see any same-sex couples asking for a legal marriage for multiple partners. That is the realm of the straights, and all of them is mighty religious, as well.
1	But if the Bible is the Word of God, then it is the truth, is it not? Hence, this would be far more reliable than man-made methods. You interestingly enough bring up the so-called "scientific dating methods". Well, did you know that out of the 200 possible dating methods that we can apply, only 20 of those methods bring an age for things that fits with the evolutionary theory. Since you have some education in paleontology I trust that you know that most fossils do not usually contain radioactive minerals, so they cannot usually be dated by radiometric means. What is usually done is to find a volcanic flow in association with the fossil layer, and try to date that using methods such as the potassium-argon dating. Now, there have been several examples where radio-dating methods have failed.In the "Creation Magazine" there have been detailed reprots in which wood found in "250-million-year-old" sandstone, or in volcanic rock "tens of millions of years old" has given carbon-dating results of only thousands of years. Now you should know that if the wood was really 250 million years old there would be no radio-carbon isotopes in the wood. Radio-carbon dating only gives dates limited to a few thousand years according to evolutionary theory. So now comes the question, which one are you going to trust? This example came from: Snelling, A., "Radioactive dating in conflict!", Creation 20(1):24-27, 1998. Also when creation geologists sample volcanic rock known to have flowed in historic times, sending it to reputable radiometric dating labs, such as Oxford, the "dating" almost invariably gives results in the millions of years! This came from: Snelling, A., "Radioactive Dating Failure", Creation 22(1):18-21, 2000. This strongly suggests that the assumptions behind the dating methods are flawed. Now creationists don't have all the answers when it comes to radio-active dating, but they know that there is something wrong with it, examplified by the examples above.
1	Of course it is based on the evidence, as is creation. They are both different interpretations about the same evidence that are ultimately determined by a person's underlying assumptions or belief systems. But we can reason that there must be God by way of observing the beauty and design all around us, the truth of the Bible, etc. All of these things only imply that a creator exists. We see a computer program, we know it needs a programmer. In a similar way, we see the highly complex DNA system, we must reason, coming to a similar conclusion that it needs a Designer.
1	And that remark is relevant because? Just to inform you once again, the word is  stasis.  You make yourself look ignorant and foolish when you can't even spell correctly. However, stasis is the norm in a stable environment. The reasons are simple. Organisms tend to become well adapted to a stable environment. As Richard Dawkins would explain, they tend to become adapted to a particular nich in a particular environment, and when that environment undergoes rapid change, they go extinct. The fossil record is full of such examples. Dawkins used the analogy of climbing a mountain of adaptation that made it impossible for the organism to cross to the peak of the new environment. Try reading  Climbing Mount Improbable  for an understanding.
1	marc says some pretty ridiculous things on a regular basis here, but this one's gotta be in the top ten. To think that there were no arguments for atheism or against theism before Darwin is the height if philosophical ignorance. After all, when I tried to engage marc in a discussion totally independent of evolution -- morality -- he ran.
1	You question whether intellectual property exists? It is really property. It is a field of law. Studied at Berkley http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/courses/fall02/ipintro.html and at Columbus http://faculty.cua.edu/fischer/Intro%20To%20IP%2
0	And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.
1	Again, so does the  theory  of the flying spaghetti monster. Please explain how ID should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution but not the flyinig spaghetti monster  theory .
1	Yeah, it was 9-zip on the individual right to kba in Heller.  Over 35,000 watchers ... no one thought it would not be incorporated.  Part of the transcript with Tom and Erin:
1	I think it's pretty clear that this is in violation of the Supreme Court's current abortion jurisprudence, at least to the extent that one could actually figure that out. The question is, are there enough justices on the Supreme Court who would reverse the judge-made Constitutional Amendment which granted an absolute right to abortion.  This would not solve the problem as there would be many out there who would claim that they cannot be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs are available just like they can't be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs aren't available.  There really is nothing wrong with the States posessing power. In fact, it is quite in line with the Constitution if the States really did have more power than the Federal Government, which by the way, I do not believe is the case today.
1	Well then there's grounds for a lawsuit. Find a group of veterans and get them to sue the VA, funded by the NRA, and take the whole organization to court on charges of violating federal standards.
1	The press shys for lots of reasons :-\ There has been no effort to either confirm or deny this story, probably because she won't come forward one way or the other. Without anything new to say or juicy video to show, the mainstream media won't bother.
1	Another slimy attempt by you to misrepresent my position. Of course eight children being murdered is a horrible tragedy but statistically it doesn't tell us anything. You and your comrades might want to educate yourselves about the meaning of "statistical significance" before responding.
0	Just going on what you have posted here ..  ..it looks like the first verse is decribing manslaughter - two men fighting - they bump into a pregnant woman - her baby dies...or does it?.  ..the second verse is describing murder.
0	Go do a Google search and find out.  How many babies have you supported killing?
1	And SS's hypothesis is demonstrably false. Humans are one of the least genetically diverse organisms, and yet, there is an average of 14 alleles for every gene in the human population. Any two people can, at most, carry 4 alleles for any given gene.Even if we consider a very simple and famous example, the peppered moth (Biston betularia), we find that the color is determined by a single gene of which there are 5 known alleles.And then there is the great variety in domestic dogs. Although there is little doubt that our dogs are descended from wolves from somewhere in Asia, there are many, many alleles that do not exist in any population of wolves. Some breeds are the result of known mutations.
1	In any private sale there is no paper record. As some others point out here, when you register to purchase a gun at a licensed dealer, the only information that the federal government recieves is the stuff for your background check, which must be destroyed.What these folks DONT realise, is that all firearms transfers made by licensed dealers are required bt BATF regulation to be recorded in the dealer "bound book" of firearm transfers. Federal law says they are required to keep these books forever, or if they fail to renew their FFL, they are required to send the bound book to the ATF. Also by federal law, they are required to make that bound book available to the ATF at any time, without a warrant, in order to facilitate the tracing of firearms. A nationwide datebase of firearm owners is already HERE. It is just fragmented into a bunch of smaller parts and kept by gun dealers instead of in a central database. All it would take is a trip o each gun stor, and they would have a list of everybody who has bought a gun from a licensed dealer.As far as police tracking black market guns, it doesn't seem to work now, and I fai to see how they are going to do any better at it int he future. YOu are talking about something that can only really be detected by direct examination. A crate full of guns and a crate full of drill bits looks the same to an X ray. Guns don;t have a specific odor that dogs can be trained to detect.
0	Yes, great post BradleyHarris! well written, perceptive and insightful.
1	In the reality which the rest of us inhabit, the onus of proof is on the person making the claim. emoticon_rolleyes
1	Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose. I'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion. And of course, mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection.
1	The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait
0	That's right! Everyone of the fundamentalists are on the band wagon about abortion being murder. The same ones depend on their ministers to hail the words for the biblical scholars. I think it's called Hypocrisy at its finest! Some people won't read for themselves but condem others who do.
0	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?
1	HOW we transitioned is by mutation and natural selection. The ability to walk upright gave us a better overview of the area, giving us more time to react if there was a predator around. It also freed up our hands, and we slowly began using tools more and more. As for WHEN this happened, I give you : Australopithecus afarensis

0	emoticon_wow Bob!!!! You're bad!!!!
0	You mental midgets insult my intelligence when you aren't even aware that the word omnibenevolent isn't even found in the Catholic Online - Catholic Encyclopedia . In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever. But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about.
0	Nope. Yowm could be day (a in opposed to night - thus only around 12 hours or so), it could be a 24 hour day, it could be days (as in a lifetime), it could be just a general term for  time  or a  period . It could also mean year.  Yowm can be translated as each and every one of those. So your statement is false that it is  understood  to be that when it could just as easily be translated as one of the others.
0	You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.  As I said, I may just be being nit-picky. Language apart, this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes.
0	Not really.
0	See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.
1	Reversing a decision would occur at what you might call the "law" level. Amending the Constitution is at a different level, and so doesn't count as a reversal.
0	You see, that's the problem: "generally". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country.
1	There isn't anything controversial about the articles claims, it has long been recognised that mammals evolved from reptile stock, who where descended from amphibians whose ancestors where fish.
1	Actually we do not know who the first human to get AIDS was. Most likely it was an African who got it from a green monkey last I looked into the matter, most likely by eating the creature. You are perhaps referring to case zero, but thats only as far back as the chain can be traced, its not the first case in humans.
0	Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.
1	Not at all, I'm simply forcing those making the argument to address the undeniable facts.
1	And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the "genuineness" of ~2000 year old manuscripts...
1	Woodward was a fraud, and I recall that was actually about the Piltdown man.  You're confusing your hominids.   I'm not surprised your site says so. Confusing one homind for another and citing a known fraud maker.
1	Most doctors will not perform an abortion this late without threat to the mother.
1	That's questionable. In Casey, Scalia pointed out,"But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments; if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text, as we did, for example, five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies, Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude towards us can be expected to be (ought to be) quite different. The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school -- maybe better. If, indeed, the 'liberties' protected by the Constitution are, as the Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people should demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours."Arguably, the language of the Second Amendment is ambiguous. Thus decades of controversy about its true meaning. But in Heller, Scalia decides that the court, not the people, should clarify such text. 
1	This list is a bunch of baloney.  FOUR different Chicago neighborhoods are listed here, and handguns are 100%, completely, without a doubt, BANNED there.  How can they be the most violent since  gun  violence is the worst kind of violence, and there are no guns in Chicago because of gun control?  Strict gun control lowers violence, right? That's what many here say. How do you get any harsher that a 100% complete BAN? According to gun control supporters, this should mean Chicago is 100% completely SAFE, right?  Then why is it mentioned FOUR times in this report?  Maybe one of them could explain the discrepancy. (Although, I doubt it. Their usual MO is to redirect the discussion.)
0	Not only do their superiors in higher courts think they are a joke, but their peers in other circuit courts think they are a joke.
1	Thats true. However, do we not have a state of reasonable compromise at the moment?
1	Actually no. You read the article again, and thoroughly this time.
1	In this case in NYC, the law did exactly what it and most gun laws do best...PROTECT CRIMINALS. The Sullivan Act was passed for that purpose, to protect union thugs and criminals. How do you imagine laws such as this are "reasonable" or protect the innocent, law abiding people if they can;t defend themselves which is the first law of Nature!Thanks for the admission that laws such as those do nothing for public safety and are a criminals' best friend and have no effect on Crime Control nor Criminals but punish and disarm those most needing such tools. Gun control is not crime control as your bunch likes to state. Situations like this are your worst enemy and destroy the lies told by the gun/rights grabbers.
1	This is a much poorer analogy than mine could possibly be. If drunk driving were legal and didn't affect anyone outside the driver's body it could be analogous. If drunk driving did not affect anyone outside the driver's body, I would agree that they probably should have the freedom to do so if they so choose (even if I personally disagreed). However, the reason drunk driving is illegal is that it endangers everyone on the road around the driver.
1	Actually it's funny. Mice deprived of THC (it naturally occurs in the brain) are smarter than regular mice, but die much earlier. Not because of cancer, but of  natural  causes. It wouldn't be hugely surprising if THC supplements made you live longer, albeit at a lower level of intelligence, even if the smoking aspect of taking it had negative effects that counterbalanced that.
1	It is said that the gvt. wants to take away the rights of the people to bear arms. I don't mind some restrictions on guns, but this down-right outragous. Just wait till the NRA gets their lawyers. I was reading about it earlier, the NRA won't let it stand. They are already preparing the case. GO GUN FREEDOM!

0	How is mythology relevant?
1	I say, since there are medical uses for the stuff, the drug is not pure harm (as the authoritarians assert.) Marijuana has its benefits and harms, and some of these benefits boil down to a matter of personal preference. Illegalizing it, in effect, dictates a personal preference.
0	But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.  What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?
1	I responded to your posts on the thread of "Lets discuss the actual..." I suggest we continue that discussion there.
0	I take it you have no understanding of science, much less the scientific method?
1	And wrong again. Hypotheses become theories once "enough scientists reproduce the same results repeatedl" as you crudely phrase it. Laws deal with tiny parts of the theory that can be expressed in simple mathematical terms. Natural selection is in it's basic form a law. But there is masses more to it than a simple law, so it gets to be a theory. Theories are the pinacle of achievement in science: they are, in simple laymen's terms, fact. 
0	Been there, done that, right? I wish I could die and come back to life like that.
1	You're thinking is right on, sinjin.Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one "goes further" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is “left behind” feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the “right thing” according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce.
0	The link doesn't work. This is unfortunate if it applies to public officials. I believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public, equally under the law. That's their job. I'm glad they have to do their job in Canada. Would you want a public servant to refuse you because he or she does not share your Evangelical beliefs, jyoshu?
0	Oh, WW, come on now. If you say something to me about how Vitality works, and I say 'that's a stupid / simple-minded idea', are you seriously telling me you wouldn't take that as a personal attack?
1	And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
0	*interupts debate for a second* Yay! Welcome. :)
0	Firearms aren't comparable to cigars and cigarettes. We've explained that before, but you just continue to ignore the facts. Guns and drugs aren't the same, they can't be compared. Shooting NEVER causes cancer, however the carcinogens in cigarettes DO cause cancer.

0	You mean yours. Make up your mind as to whether or not there's a problem and what it is. State for the board.  You already know I support HR 676 which is under 30 pages.  Reading and mathematics. Something you could try.
0	And if everything in our power fails and the fetus has a terminal condition that will threaten it's own life and the life of it's mother if it is born? Making blanket statements such as yours ignores reality.Is it murder to save the life of the mother at the fetus' expense? This question of course ignores that murder can only occur if it is an illegal killing.
0	That's not true. You asked standard creationist questions with a standard creationist attitude. Your views are pretty clear from the smartass way you asked and your final comment.
1	Yes they sure will.... with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns. But if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole (literary form of exageration to express a point) I will try in the future to keep it down to your level.
1	So 50 or so anonymous people claim that they used a gun in self defense in a survey and this can be believed and extrapolated to the general population of America but news accounts of 44 concealed weapons carriers misusing their weapons cannot?
0	Oh please - and the prolife side doesn't do this?  All the pics they distribute of aborted babies aren't the very rare late term ones? It's called propganda and generally both sides use it in most major debates.
1	The scientific method must stick to the measurable, observable and testable otherwise it stops being, well, science.  The moment you invoke the supernatural as a reason for a natural event is when the science has stopped- for example intelligent design will go some way with the empirical and then flip to the supernatural at the last hurdle. ID would say this is the eye, its structure has evolved through organism x->y->z we see in the fossil record and then say God directly shaped this design as it is too complex to have happened by chance, whereas science will say the eye was a response to a natural evolutionary pressure say from predation, environment and so on and is a product of natural selection.  The latter view here could be reconcilled in a number of ways with a religious beief, but the former can never be reconcilled with science.
0	NO ONE HAS TO HAVE A GUN! The point is is that the choice should be up to the individual. If a criminal thinks you are armed he will move on (or he has a death wish)
0	I'm not discounting secular organizations. I'm discounting atheists. They **** and moan about the wicked Christians trying to run their lives but don't pony up when others need help. Christians lend a hand in spite of all their supposed wickedness, but atheists are typically a bunch of cheap windbags. They speak of  intrinsic morality  not being religious-based, but don't display an ounce of it when push comes to shove.
1	I know very little about evolution, but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes, so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape. Instead, I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor, but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago.  Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me, since I said, I am by no means an expert on evolution.
0	Well i know it wouldn't be sensible for anyone to call my child an it that is just disrespectfull to both your partener and child.
0	Couple thoughts... The US has used natural resoursesin the past to bail itself out of a financial wreck. A depression and three big wars.  Environmental considerations are a luxury poor nations do not have, our natural resources have in part allowed that luxury, to deny access to those resourses will eliminate options for the country in the future.....mining, cheap energy, fertilizer, forests....  I think the environmental system the US currently uses if flawed in that it trots out icons that appeal to the public instead of those things that will actually have a positive effect on the world we live in. ie baby fur seals, wolves, a rank old tree that needs to go away, condemning nuclear energy which is by far leaves the smallest environmental footprint of any power sources.  We need to weigh honest cost/benefit to all environmental decisions....cuz the cost can be deceptivly high. Lets not drown the baby in the bath water.
0	You all are missing the point that the morning after pill is abortion (or rather could be). It can still kill a human life on purpose.
1	You do know that 'polystrate' is not a term used by geologists at all, don't you?  However, you do have times that there is very rapid sedimentation.  The answer to that 'condundrum' has been known since the 19th century, and creationists don't get it yet.  From  Polystrate  Tree Fossils  Since the answer was shown to be answered in 1868, it shows that effort to use that 'conundrum'' is rather dishonest and ignorant.
1	Actually, Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong. The fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant.
1	its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science, even though science's purpose is to study life. for instance, can life be defined as energy? can life be compared with energy? if so, then birth becomes as much of an enigma as death; is energy created too?(not really addressing the debate, but more like raising more thoughts to debate on...)
0	**Sorry to hear you say this. I have never attacked you personally, never said anything like what you accuse me of saying. I have characterized certain ideas, notions, and opinions as stupid and simple-minded, but not you personally. If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.
0	Good point. Touche.Though lots of folks have not had abortions. Certainly most men have not. I was just growing tired of a certain little poster's uninformed opinions of sexual activity. My post was intended to be a little playful. If it missed the mark, mea culpa.
1	You do know that 'polystrate' is not a term used by geologists at all, don't you?  However, you do have times that there is very rapid sedimentation.  The answer to that 'condundrum' has been known since the 19th century, and creationists don't get it yet.  From  Polystrate  Tree Fossils  Since the answer was shown to be answered in 1868, it shows that effort to use that 'conundrum'' is rather dishonest and ignorant.
1	Most doctors wont perform abortions.
1	Yes there is honor in marriage but we are talking about a piece of paper that defines who is considered your family in the eyes of the law.
0	Why, is there something wrong with being pro abortion?

1	Why doesn't this apply to Soviet Russia - which had a population of similar size ? Presumably, your answer would be that the USSR was less  developed  than the US ?
0	The problem with your statement is that freedom of religion is specificly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Government recognition of marriage is not.  As I have told Mathew S on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages. You are also free to vote your opinion on such initatives, but so is everyone else.

1	You wanna compare foreign nations even though no two stats are comparable or similar? Fine, let's look at China and their rising gun crime.
0	Because they're hoplophobe sissies.
0	You have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument.
1	But if you had read carefully the information that I provided you would realize:  The people that already own weapons don't seem to be doing much to combat crime and are probably doing more to cause the problem than to solve it. So throwing more guns at the problem doesn't seem to make much sense.
1	Mmmmm, not necessarily. Many of the arguments of against gods (those with specific properties, not just a general diety) deal with incompatible traits, like a square circle has. One does not have to search the universe to know square circles do not exist.People state simple negatives all the time. The lack of evidence for the positive makes them reasonable.
1	No....that is incorrect. Divorce has been around for centuries and was used in biblical times when a woman or man cheated on their spouse. Same sex marriage has never received any good stamp of approval in civilized societies.
0	Because evolution is how God created. Sorry, but we can't lie to our kids. We can't tell them creationism is true when God tells us it is false.
0	Could someone please explain the difference between  Civil Union  and  Marriage  except for the name?
1	Agreed that they are still the same species, much like the  13 species  of Darwin's Finches, and I have no problem with evolution in that respect. I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time. But I still don't see where evolution, in that sense of the term, can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest, or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland.
1	Actually no. My state does NOT protect gays and lesbians in matters regarding land ownership, employment or temporary shelter. (Such as hotel and motel accomodations)
0	I might be missing something, but where in the article does it mention information flow reversing? I've been through it a few times and it still seems to be talking about the transcription of DNA, just bits of DNA that don't code for proteins.  At best, I can infer a suggestion that RNA contributes information as well as DNA contributing information, but that's about it. I'm probably just being dense; can anyone help out?
0	** True, but then, who is not? Yourself, perhaps?
0	A curse? If you don't agree with it that's one thing. Many people have died because of Christianity. The Crusades killed many people just for not converting to Christianity. Gallileo was arrested for proposing the Earth revolves around the sun which was against the church. Atheism hasn't ever hurt anybody. And you call atheism the curse?
0	You could learn a lot from this quote.
1	Yep. Darwin's discovery was that natural selection was the reason that evolution wasn't random.
0	You're going to have to do better then that. Here's a funny comic mocking your position http://www.filibustercartoons.com/comics/20040824.gif
1	What? Sinjin Dude! Your devotion to the Democratic Party, and sticking up for your guy is admarable, but come on! It says "In actuality, according to ATF special agent William Newell, about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States."Are you calling the author a liar? Are you accusing him of journalistic fraud? If this is true, you should be. You know, if agent William Newell did not actually say that, this author will be fired. William Newell himself will tell every other news outlet that he did not say that! Are you, perhaps, a bit too zealous in standing up for your guy? Maybe you will watch this carefully, and post the story if his firing, or at the very least, his retraction. Or perhaps William Newell's statement condemning this Journalistic Fraud, if that is what it is. Man would THAT help your credibility right now. But alas, that retraction, that statement nor his firing will ever come. Although, it sure has been fun watching you dig yourself into a hole, and shred your credibility over this ATF. Obama and Obama cabinet or whom ever, Exaggeration in order to Ban Assault Weapons!It's OK Sinjin. The American people already know! emoticonXSmilie Senator John Kerry was the one who let this (What is the word? uh) discrepancy out of the bag.  Kerry qoute 
0	How very true. Anti abortion people feel their opinions should be forced upon a women and her choice about her body should not matter. They would feel different if someone were telling them they couldn't have a tumor or parasite removed from them because of someone elses belief system.
1	So it is perfectly legal to shoot someone whom you think might possibly attack you in the future with a gun...seems if anything it is far more like removing the guns from people who can't be trusted with them.
0	I think you do not know what you are talking about. Your description fits the matter "god" you belive in.
1	And what would that prove? It would certainly show that an animal adapted to survival above the Arctic circle was not adapted to the Arizona desert. Maybe it would indicate that the environmental conditions necessary for the change aren't present in Arizona. How is that relevant to evolutionary theory?
0	Did you get another cracker polly?
1	No, this is more of an ethical stand point. A fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then why is it an outrage by others to begin with? The only party that stakes out a vital rule in condemning abortion is the fetus...and unfortunately for that minority the fetus is a neutral party.  However clinical signs of life do define us as a living person. Not conception. So no living people is being aborted...at least in the majority of abortion cases.
0	Spot the difference between reading a book and carrying a gun. I'm sorry if you can't. People don't carry books because they're worried about being assailed by someone with an eraser.
0	Why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is Arab or not? Aren't the Arab and non-Arab created by God? Why all this discrimination among the creation of God?  eanassir
0	So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all.  A woman who has an abortion out of convenience or as just a form of after-the-act birth control is hardly exercising determination of what constitutes a person, at all. She just wants out with no regard for the baby. People like myself don't so much have a problem with choice if your movement will at least acknowledge and show the value of the life growing inside that will be a child, adolescent, and adult rather than ONLY focusing on the mother as if the fetus has no relevance or value whatsoever. We just want to save lives of those needlessly killed.
1	but there is no federal law that says children cant tote around guns their parents own  how many times do I have to explain it you
1	And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world.

1	State courts can rule based on state and/or federal law. In this case, the answer was found in the state constitution, so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further.Also, a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one, as long as, in so doing, it does not contradict the federal constitution.

1	Look at the DJIA. In the early 30s the economy was starting to turn around. Was it the New Deal? I'm willing to accept that. But the economy was about as low as it could go and could go no where else but up. In the years just before WW2 it looked like the economy was about it take another dump. Saying the New Deal saved the country does have some merit, but it is shaky at best. I can say for sure the economic explosion after WW2 was due to massive defense spending.
1	This is the situation as it is in Britain.

What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?
0	Well, evolution by natural selection makes things look as if they were designed for the environment in which they live. I don't presume to give God instructions on how he should go about His work. I only observe it.
0	Of course I believe an unborn fetus is simply an unborn child. The only difference is that the unborn has no means of survival without the mother and is not recognized as being a living person. I don't wish that this child should be killed, but as I said before it can be for the best. And if you really do believe in heaven, then the child is going there anyways. Why would you wish a life of suffering on it instead of being able to skip all that and go straight to heaven? This is the type of logic that works against those who believe in a soul since it really doesn't make much sense to live on Earth when heaven is a million billion times better.Just to answer your question with a question, how do you know a child would choose life over death when it has never lived? People commit suicide everyday but I'm sure they would also choose life over death if they had been in a better situation. Perhaps this is being too extreme. A person would likely choose to live when faced with death, but whether it logically make sense is another question. People will try to live through starvation, sickness, and misery because it is what their mind tells them to do. Is it really best that they are alive?
1	Chapter 7.-Whether Even the Remotest Islands Received Their Fauna from the Animals Which Were Preserved, Through the Deluge, in the Ark.There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts which are not domesticated, nor are produced like frogs from the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents, such as wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how they could be found in the islands after the deluge, in which all the animals not in the ark perished, unless the breed was restored from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark. It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the islands by swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy no animal could swim to them. But if men caught them and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated these breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase. At the same time, it cannot be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be transferred by God's order or permission. If, however, they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation, when God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature,"25 this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of renewing the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which were to be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident, if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which they could not cross over.St. Aurelius Augustinhttp://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-0...#P2783_1557226Further...from a Q&A Orthodox siteQA non-Christian person has pointed out what he believes to be a contradiction in the book of Genesis. First, God commanded Noah to take two of every living creature without distinguishing between clean or not clean ones: Gen 6: 19-20 "And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive." Then, God distinguished between the clean creatures and the unclean as follow: Gen 7: 2-3 "Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth." Noah though, took only two of every kind ignoring the second command of God by taking seven of the clean ones as it is stated here: Gen 7: 8-9 "Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah."ANoah did not ignore God's commandment but followed it exactly. God's command to Noah was "Two of every sort ?. , to keep them alive" (Gen 6:19-20) Those are the minimum of each species to go in the ark and be kept alive afterwards. Then God gave Noah more specific instructions, to take seven pairs of the clean beasts and of the clean birds. The purpose of this became clear after the flood. The birds were needed to explore the earth (Gen 8:7-12) and the clean animals to be used as sacrifice to the Lord. Noah did not ignore this commandment but the Bible says " There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female"  If you read this carefully it does not say one pair of each species but that they went in as pairs males and females. If Noah had taken only one pair of each and then offered each of these pairs in sacrifice, these species would have become completely extinct.
1	Doesn't count. Took place in a  gun free zone . By law no guns are allowed there, so by law this incident couldn't take place.
1	Yes, it means the kind of regulations that would be necessary to create an effective militia, not necessarily those aimed at protecting public safety. And it is because groups like the NRA don't advocate such legislation that Cornell says that neither side is interested in protecting or returning to the original right to bear arms.
0	So you view is that their religious freedom is more important then mine? That their families are more important then mine?
1	But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.
1	No Matt, that's not what I'm saying at all. The truths and principles in the OT still stand up today and always will. Some of the customs and traditions of that period no longer apply but the OT never promoted those customs and traditions as eternal standards to live by.
1	But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.
0	Yes that would solve the problem wouldn't it,worked the first time around,I say that because we (U.S.)are compared to the wild west.  But be they whites,Blacks,Reds,or pi** purple shoot a few that try to detain or threaten you, yeah I think they will back off unless they are prepared to go to war.
1	I know that also. I have said for years now that the study of earth will reveal things as we go. I meant that it will be found out, not that science is on an expedition to do so. (That's why I attached the  forced  sentence afterwards).
0	I dunno, we have 365 days to find out...there won't be a 66 I know that :)
1	can we get a better difination of "gun control"? are you talking the leval of regulation i have in Indiana, the levals in NYC, having no controles (no checks, no licences for carry, no tax stamp for NFA weapons), or the other side of just asking Mr. and Mrs. America to turn them in?
1	This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.
1	False. Random mutation and natural selection have been observed in the lab using bacteria; in some cases the researchers even determined exactly which mutations in the genomes produced the advantageous changes.
1	But then again, I guess it just proves my point.  Quod erat demonstrandum.
1	Nope. Not part of evolutionary theory. It would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would "disallow" any portion of the population from breeding.
0	Well done Monty. Mark that up as your first ever 100% honest and accurate post here.
1	You start off with 'mutation that provides new/useful information'. I provide it - the 'panda gene' is both a new piece of information, and is demonstratively useful (either in the modern world of breed-obsession, or the ancient world where improved camouflage would come in handy). You redefine what you originally asked for into 'mutation that changes a hair into a scale/feather' -something which is highly unlikely to happen with a single mutation.  That's horrific moving of the goalposts.
1	Again, you are off the mark. This is not a reference to Lamarckism (which is what I guess you were trying to say). Even Darwin observed that novel characters were passed on to offspring. And he was smart enough to realize that these were not characteristics gained from use.
0	I figure that for freedom OF religion to continue, our freedom FROM religion must be guaranteed.  How can our freedom OF religion be a sure thing, when other religions force themselves upon us throught the government and legal system?
1	Look at the 2 side by side. They are as different as night and day. No creature can live without breathing for millions of years except in fairy tales.
0	This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering.
1	Pregnancy isn't expensive at all unless you're conned into thinking it has to be. If it were, poor people couldn't have the kids they do. Medical costs can be paid for by others. It's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly.  In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption, there is NO cost incurred to the mother.
1	Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called  womens issuses  be in valid?
0	As above
1	Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious.  This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.
0	Exactly so.  Pro-choice people would not impose their values on anyone; profetallifers would impose theirs on every woman of child bearing age.
0	Maybe they just drink too much coffee. And you probably work with more "reefer heads" than you think.
1	I know the fallacy.  I have not used that argument.
1	No. That would be adaption. It wouldn't involve any genetic change. Another word for it might aclimatization. Your example shows little thought. The Polar bear's webbed feet are genetic. Even if a Polar bear lived it's whole live in a cage without ever going near water, it would still have webbed feet.That really is absolutely the most ignorant thing I have ever heard. The water stretches the skin through friction! Don't you just love "creation science"? You get to make it up as you go.
1	Hm... And I allowed to bring the amendments into this?
1	And neither can millions of other heterosexuals, something you ignore. As for nature, technically anything that occurs ever without supernatural causes is in fact in nature. We are a part of nature. Everything we do is a part of nature. Therefore, by taking the genetic data of two gays, placing it in a egg and having a surrogate mother bring it to term, gays can reproduce themselves.
1	Yes they do. Modern Coelocanth: Modern Coelocanth
1	How about the reverse: How does providing all the benifits of marriage to homosexual couples by granting civil-unions instead of marriages descriminate against them?  An example: legal guardians perform the same role of parents, except the arrangement is a legal one instead of a genitic one.  Loving couples should be able to be recognized by the government, but the use of the religious term offends many people.  Seperate but equal? Maybe. Almost all sports are separated between men and women - because, while the rules may be the same, there is a fundamental difference between those groups.  Regards
1	I hate to break this to you but this is racked with illogic.  Well, ok it's  logical  but the premises rely on things that are pure assumptions.  Just because something can't be detected doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  And, of course, if god is god the way we think about it, then God is everywhere, including in this universe. He is the universe (but we can't detect him). Does he exist now or not?
1	I believe I would know when my own post is sarcasm or not...
0	Oh, really?   Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to.
0	Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.
1	Well nothing, other than the fact that I don't believe it to be true!  But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.  I don't see why not, it appears the most logical explanation to me.  You are right, it's not a nice thought. But then again little in life is. Why should this be any different?
1	That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.
1	Oregon is another argument on behalf of a single payer health care system.  Now that some time has passed, we can see that they did NOT and do NOT have enough money to pay for it. Hospitals making value judgments on individuals' lives ... like who is more worthy of treatment? A cancer sufferer? Or someone with heart disease?  Pro-life means everyone gets health care. No ifs, ands or buts.
0	So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.
0	Well then move out of the rough areas. Stop staying in them like some battered spouse who can't seem to break the cycle of abuse and leave their partner.Stop whining about how bad life is because there are guns in America. Imagine how much better if would be if the drug dealers and mass murderers weren't allowed to walk the streets as if they owned them.
0	That's a vague statement.
1	Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.
1	Or in any culture. Women abort WORLDWIDE you know jyoshu.For what it's worth, I certainly AM bothered by this if it's true. I'd like to see the source where you got that information about the abortion rate climbing under Bush's presidency, if you would. http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/30/op...d%2fColumnists (sorry about the long address - also you may need to register, but it's free) and an interesting article on http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld...on/9924004.htm
1	The Sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet, but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life. There are hypotheses that energy necessary, chemical catalysts available, Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, but not Oxygen apart from being part of the Water molecule. There are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea. There is an availability of Sulfur, heat energy, and the triggering of a Sulphur based metabolism. It was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity. Some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure Uranium.However, there is no need to debate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is a ruse by Magical Creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make Earth a closed entropy system.CuchulainnPS: Fundies have an obligation to show why the fires of Hell are exempt from the 2nd Law. I already know the answer. Hell is imaginary and imaginary things do not gain entropy.:)
0	To me, part of the point of the "please, no scripture" comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to.A person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on Father's Fay, but I would argue that it's not reasonable to do so in every case. For example, if the father was physically or sexually abusive, or the father abandoned his children, those would be reasons to fore-go any Father's Day formalities.And "God" could be viewed as the absent father. Suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth. What's his involvement been since then?Should we worship him just because he's God?Or, depending upon how one sees God, is God a being unworthy of worship and idolization?And along those lines, utilizing the Bible as a reference could be a double-edged sword. The "God" of the Old Testament ordered slavery, misogyny, genocide, women as spoils of war, ...
1	Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.
0	The abortion issue is one that rightwingers use to threaten women and keep them  in their place. 
0	If everytime I say something you(you in the general sense) bring out  that is oppressive to women  then please don't bother posting. If you don't believe in it you don't...I guess you could say if you don't support drugs you are oppressing the drug users....but you really arent.
1	Actually, a few studies I've seen suggest exactly that. Looking at the birth rates among the various ethnic groups, and correcting for better birth control, etc, the rate actually remained fairly constant from before the Roe v Wade decision to the years afterwards. This suggests that the number of abortions remained fairly constant, they simply became legal to perform and recieve.My feeling is, the desire and need for the abortion option has always been there. The legality will affect it, but not to a great extent.
1	Oh, what the hell.  As is so often the case, I have a definitive source on this:  http://www.lunaseas.net/gaps/episode9.html
1	Oh dear; where do I even start?Ok, look, the ToE doesn't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere. It just doesn't.The evolution of something as complex as a wing proceeds by a lot of intermediate steps, each one of them being useful, or at least associated with something useful. We don't see humans or dogs or alligators suddenly sprouting wings because that would require massive wholesale genomic, and probably epigenetic, change. What we do see are more mundane, less drastic variations which can accumulate over time.It's tempting to think "wings evolving from arms; huh, what about the millions of years when they were neither; how could they have been 'fittest'?" The mistake there is in visualising a straightforward morph from 'then' to 'now', as if the organism knew where it was headed. A better way to imagine it is via an intermediate stage where the arms were still useful as arms, but also conferred an aerodynamic advantage, such as we see in flying squirrels today. If the original purpose of the arms later becomes less important, those features can atrophy while improved aerodynamic qualities remain strongly selected. The divergence of mice and bats is likely to have followed just such a pattern; who knows, in another ten million years we might see descendents of flying squirrels that are as adept in the air as bats are today.So in a sense, 'flying squirrels' are your answer. I can't guarantee they'll evolve more and more wing-like structures over the next few million years, but it's possible.

1	So what you're saying is that if ID really were worthless non-science, we'd be able to tell because everyone would be happy for it to be taught alongside evolution in science class? Yeah, that makes perfect senseHopefully you can now see how far we've me
0	I agree, women are not child bearing cubicles thats only function in life is to have babys. What trouble's me is that, if men had to go through what women did in pregnancy, the pro-life movement would be totally non-existant. Men are really not capable of being pro-life without being a hypocryte, as they have not experienced pregnancy. Why that is not true of the pro-choice side, is that we let the women choose, and she can choose both ways if she wishes. The pro-life movement involves force and blatant disregard for rights of the women, to the point of violation, yet the men have almost no knowledge of what it is like to get pregnant or have babies. Many pro-life men do know what raising a child is like, but they do not know what raising a child is like when you are a 14 year old girl with three kids already and no money. Yes, not all abortions go this way, but some do, and thats the point. You don't know every women's circumstances, and until you do, you are in no position to force her to abide by your morals, and thus harming her.
1	I heard that Harry Reid will allow Scott Brown to be sworn in before any more health care voting takes place. I just need to know if the liberals can sill find a way to pass this bill without the votes they need and without the support of the American People. Could they say, lie and rush through a vote in the middle of the night before Brown is sworn in?
0	You see jyoshu, what foundit's saying is that they (the homosexual community) understand, or prefer to believe that Biden was blatantly lying to America for the sake of political expediency. Lying doesn't bother them at all. It's the candidate that tells the truth about where they stand that these people have no respect for. Thus, what is wrong, is right to them, and what is right, is wrong to them.
0	I think the real question is not detaching but killing. You don't detach a fetus during an abortion..you just kill the fetus (or embryo) and suck it out. I am not sure Tom is for any of that.  But if Tom would die, then no...Bob has no right to detach...in fact, probably no right even if he wouldn't die.

0	well, it is irrational if you believe that human life is a good thing. Some people tend to think that it is ok to degrade people because it 1) makes economic sense 2) cuts down on the population 3) makes THEIR life easier. However, when you degrade people you make society worse off...so I really don't see a point. Nice to see you here by the way.

(the people who later became the Brady Campaign) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position. However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying "I never said that" and trying to reverse his position.Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after.

1	Are you actually suggesting that McIntyre and McKitrick are the only voices which oppose the fraud of man made global warming? How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue? Here's an excerpt:Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus"[I]n November 2004, German climatologist Hans von Storch, director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research (IfK) in Geesthacht, Germany, foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ..."Environment & Climate News > August 2005Environment Environment > Climate: Consensus Email a FriendWritten By: Alan CarubaPublished In: Environment & Climate News > August 2005Publication date: 08/01/2005Publisher: The Heartland InstituteLeading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring.Alarmists Claim Debate OverOn June 1, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) claimed "the debate is over" and global warming alarmists' predictions had carried the day.The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared, "The world's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now. According to their forecasts, extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought, crop failure, famine, flood and mass extinctions."On June 13, USA Today declared, "The debate's over: Globe is Warming." In support of its claim, the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups, some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources, and some politicians.Scientists DisagreeWhile each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage, leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations.Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service, sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim. "Your editorial ... claim[s] the global warming debate is over. Not so," wrote Singer.Singer wrote, "Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] says. And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F--not exactly a catastrophe."Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media, "Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically."Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto (estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University--see http://www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm--at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries), climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change."Sun Called Primary Cause"If we just look at the historical data, there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century," said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. "The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate. This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences."The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations, according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England's John Moore's University, is solar ray activity. "Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world's leading space science journals. The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth's climate," Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post.Moreover, reports Peiser, Jan Veizer, one of Canada's top earth scientists, published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded, "empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate, with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers."Added Peiser, "In fact, the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists. It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists, both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea."Heartland Institute - ArticleAnd here's more:Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming – Caps Year of Vindication for SkepticsOctober 17, 2006October 17, 2006Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic. This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics. Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific “consensus” on climate alarmism.Claude Allegre, a former government official and an active member of France’s Socialist Party, wrote an editorial on September 21, 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” (For English Translation, click here: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming. See: http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune...asp?ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the “cause of climate change remains unknown” and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming, but to local land use and precipitation changes. Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice.“Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes,” Allegre wrote. He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money, noting that “the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!”Allegre, a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences, had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming. "By burning fossil fuels, man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century," Allegre wrote 20 years ago. In addition, Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18, 1992 letter titled “World Scientists' Warning to Humanity” in which the scientists warned that global warming’s “potential risks are very great.” See: Warning to HumanityAllegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles, written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States.Allegre's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a “consensus” about manmade global warming. Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently. An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to “Holocaust deniers.” See: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition, former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as "global warming deniers."This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists’ computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics.60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming FearsEarlier this year, a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called “consensus” that the Earth faces a “climate emergency.” On April 6, 2006, 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists.“Observational evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future…Significant [scientific] advances have been made since the [Kyoto] protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary,” the 60 scientists wrote. See: Open Kyoto to debate“It was only 30 years ago that many of today's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe. But the science continued to evolve, and still does, even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas,” the 60 scientists concluded..: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works :: Press Room :.So in conclusion, as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions, so is the myth of Global Warming.

1	I know that I've tried to make this argument before on another thread but Jesus was not God in that sence but the Son of God. God even says in the Bible that Jesus is his son so that they are apart of eachother but are not the same. Also, how do you know that a lot of the laws put into Leviticus were not just ones added by the chief priest? After all, the Bible was writen down by human hands.Also I want to make reference to John 3: 16-17 (TEV* translation)16: For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life.17: For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior.*I specify the translation because it seems that most of the posters are using KJV, which kind of annoys me when I try to read it.
1	Well, again, the best resource I could think of is wikipedia, just do a few searches there (I suggest starting with "Human evolution") and I'm sure most of your questions will be answered. Bear in mind though that even this will only give you a basic overview. If you really want to go in depth, take a college course on evolution. Another good site would be TalkOrigins Archive: Exploring the Creation/Evolution Controversy
0	So when your God killed all of the helpless, little first borns in Egypt he too was another baby-killing liberal? You are very amusing and naive.
1	Although few mothers would do such a thing, I think that it is clear a mother would have the same right to do this as with a world-famous violinist. The fact that we would disapprove of such a women is not really important: emotive reactions don't constitute proof. If they did, the writer could simply say: 'I think women who have abortions are terrible' and his job would be done.I'm dubious about the whole human rights basis of much modern debate on issues like abortion - I support neither the premises, reasoning or conclusion of the violinist argument. But this whole counter-argument seems to me extremely weak.
1	Yeah, sure your right. Take Ellen for example. It was not too long ago...or perhaps it was (I'm getting old) that she came out of the closet screaming about being gay...and how proud she was to finally be able to say it out loud. She and her partner/s have been at the front of headlines for years, and she actively speaks out on behalf of gay / lesbian groups. Yet she still seems to be above the anti-gay contempt of most. Does anyone think it is perhaps that most of America got to know her as a celebrity before they found out she was gay?
0	On the issue of not living at all i m not shure there is a reasonable answer as to how someone who was never born could possibly recognise not exsisting as being   worse than living...    Let me say I personally don't like the idea of aborting a pregnancy. However I can't possibly understand how we would not FIRST adopt all those kids in homes first and then fight the battel for saving the unwanted unborn.
1	As a Biology teacher, I'm trying to defend my subject against ignorant abuse. If you ask whether endless exchanges with the wilfully ignorant actually constitute effective defence, I'll pass.
0	But why is that criteria of birth important, in your view, for calling it a person? Is the existence of a person dependent on their physical location, in your view (in this case, inside the woman's body vs outside)? Otherwise, are there other characteristics that change in the fetus from the moments it is inside the body to the moment it is outside of the body? How about when it is born but not yet disconnected from its mother by cutting the umbilical cord?I understand that you might be stating this for legal reasons - i.e. defining person as born since the term person might automatically have rights attached and you don't want any rights for fetuses - no matter what their state of development. If so, then I would say that you are putting the cart before the horse. In viewing moral issues, I think one should try to understand the fundamentals and then work legal opinions around those fundamentals - not the other way around.
1	I believe that if abortion should ever become illegal again that the mother should be charged with murder in the first. A fetus is a human from the moment the sperm and the egg meet. If a husband murders his preagnant wife he is charged with murder not only for the mother but for the fetus as well. Not to mention a fetus is murdered in a very brutall way, they dont even get the luxery of being shot or stabbed they get dismembered.
0	WOW! Is that English? Are you sure that you understand the question? Is this little bit on unintelligible babble supposed to be meaningful?
1	It's still the same argument.  A fetus is a citizen, it's intrustion on the fetus, (and the pregant woman?)  OR  A fetus is not a citizen, it's intruston on the pregant woman.

0	So what do you think about the fact that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of those who are aborted?  While this baby 21 week baby is living in one hospital room, down the hall a 22/23/24/25/26 ect week baby is being aborted because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1	What early days are you talking about?In ancient Greece, everything was about logic and order and was put into a polytheistic context. Then Aristotle came along and gave us "emprical" thought.When christianity rolled onto the scene, most "science" of those first 1700 years (mostly things like astrology and alchemy) were seen as witchcraft and such and was persecuted.Maybe you mean the early days of modern science, starting around the enlightenment period. This was the time of a rise in secular humanism and science was largely an extension of that philosophy. They used to just call it "natural philosophy" and it was usually at odds with church doctrine. There are, of course, exceptions to this, but on the whole science was not favored by the church. So any "creation science" going on was just a bunch of theologians arguing. (actually I do remember reading about late 18th century geologists trying to fit what they found, including fossils, into a Biblical Noah's Ark context, and then they eventually had to scrap it because things stopped fitting, and quite often)http://www.wsu.edu:8000/~dee/ENLIGHT/SCIREV.HTMI thought this was a pretty interesting page.I never knew all those common chemistry words came from arabic.

1	Not really, this case was different in that the state was the guardian. Although I am sure it has happened before. As for three reasons...1) The state of Florida doesn't believe a 13 yr old can have sex (consent) so why couold she be able to cosent to an abortion?2) The State is the guardian and they should be able to say where she can and can't go as a parent would be able to do....and the state has a law against taking kids to abortion clinics.3) ABORTION IS KILLING A KID. Maybe that doesn't matter for most :-/
1	And you've failed to explain exactly how Heller was a blank check endorsement on schemes such as gun rationing. Explain exactly how the judges ruling that the Second Amendment is truly an individual right, how DC's ban on handgun ownership and their trigger lock requirements being unconstitutional, would in any way suggest that one-gun-a-month laws pass constitutional muster.  Furthermore how to you reconcile the effects of gun rationing, with the fact that such laws make it absolutely impossible to catch gun traffickers in the act?  Give us some straight answers or leave the debate!
1	As a matter of perspective on the above;  Roe is, was and always will be the historical reference for an example of  judicial activism.   Roe did not establish the  right to chose  if it had, the States could not regulate abortions at all.  The activists judges in Roe manufactured law in an attempt to balance the rights of a woman to her privacy against the States right to regulate abortion.  Doesn't anyone care about researching the facts before theygo running off at the mouth anymore?  Roe v. Wade - Oral Arguments  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, (later to become Chief Justice) dissenting.http://www.audiocasefiles.com/acf_cases/8960-roe-v-wade   The Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its reliance on the  compelling state interest  test. See Weber v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. . . . (dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the  compelling state interest test,  the Court's opinion will accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more confused than it found it.

1	In theory true but it gets convoluted when the discussion focuses on information that is freely offered by a citizen that seems innocuous but is actually incriminating under certain situations. EZ-Pass could be used to issue speeding tickets; the authorities know the minimum time it should take to travel between exits . . . You do it in a shorter time and you are issued a ticket. You have provided the authorities the evidence of your criminality and the means to prove it - but is that self-incrimination?
0	Well ... that does tend to happen when you waste time arguing the obvious as if it were a rebuttal to anything. Maybe rather than being argumentative to the point of arguing over things that are pointless and that no one disagrees on, you could thoughtfully discuss things that people don't see eye to eye on. You might get better results from people that way.

What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.
1	Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?

1	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation. 
0	with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem....
1	Indeed. Many people don't realize that the commandment is not "thou shalt not kill," but "thou shalt not murder." The important question then becomes, when is killing murder?I have no doubt that God cares for the lives of fetuses. But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women.The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it's often taken to establish that abortion is murder, and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly. But the passage isn't talking about abortion at all. Which just leaves us with the question of when it is or isn't acceptable to take a life, and the passage doesn't provide guidance to that general question, either.

1	Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of "arms" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case.
1	Doesn't it ever bother you that you have to come up with ridiculous hypothetical sci-fi scenarios to attempt to prove your side?First of all, do you really think a head on life support is going to "be no different mentally from someone with a body."? I would say that would probably mess with somebody's head a bit.Secondly, you sound like you believe this person who is a head on life support deserves equal rights. They are just as helpless as a fetus in the womb. Are you saying it's okay to murder people who can't think and talk? Do you believe that thinking and talking is what qualifies a person for rights?
1	Well, Barbarian is 1) a Christian, 2) a biologist, and 3) a teacher. I have known him on various boards for several years and I always marvel at his patience, as well as his knowledge. My impression is that he is knowledgeable and competent in each. (Can he figure out who I am?)  Sadly, I am not as patient as he. As has been pointed out to me on many occasions, I do not tolerate it well when ignorance is paraded as authority. For some reason, even when I mean no animosity, if I explain to a creationist why he/she is wrong, I am accused of being pedantic and dogmatic - even rude.
0	But I don't hear you saying things like "baseball is always harmful to the player" or "baseball is something no one should have to go through."You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.Besides, no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place.
1	Wonderful News. Nice to see that at least some of the states here in the US have some common sense and are at least heading towards equality for gay couples. Good to hear about Oregon joining in soon.
1	Okay, I won't say  preseservative,  whatever the hell that is. (I can't say I'm impressed with what you think passes for literacy.) Fossils aren't bones; there are fossils of dinos and fossils of hominids, but not together. Plus, you can't refute multiple independent radioactive date correlations, millions of varves, millions of annual ice layers, plate tectonics, ferrimagnetic pattern reversals...
0	I've always disliked this line of logic because it implies that the value of somebody's life depends on their relative accomplishments and it invites the counter argument that the unborn in question could also become a criminal. Indeed, it has been argued that abortion has reduced crime, poverty, overpopulation and the depletion of natural resources.

1	The "flood: scientifically possible?" thread is evidence that arch ignores essentially everything scientifically and factually relevant about the flood. Fossil record shows sorting largely by complexity, not density. Huh. That's magic water!Geological record lacks a uniform layer of sediment similar to the K-T iridium layer. Magic water again!Geological record doesn't support massive geological changes happening in 4,000 years. Magic Land perhaps? Basic marine organisms can't tolerate massive salinity changes.

0	I'm not discounting secular organizations. I'm discounting atheists. They **** and moan about the wicked Christians trying to run their lives but don't pony up when others need help. Christians lend a hand in spite of all their supposed wickedness, but atheists are typically a bunch of cheap windbags. They speak of  intrinsic morality  not being religious-based, but don't display an ounce of it when push comes to shove.

1	I didn't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law.' I'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness--you know, giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions. Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story, mainly from the account of the one who got booted?? I think it was simply a private screening, and the people running the private screening didn't want them there. That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works. Again, read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there, including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself.

1	I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.

If the mind exists as something more than the physical operation of the physical brain, why does it disappear when the brain is damaged?

1	Quote:  We were all first term fetuses in the beginning. So, if your mother aborted you in the first term it would be fine, according to you. If she aborted you in the third term, then its wrong, according to you. well either way you would have been killed and wouldn't be here. Thats my point.
1	I think your theory too simple. Guns make it easier to kill people. Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun?   From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders. (Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes.   http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm
1	But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.
1	Oh...so humans all must have the same bone structure? Kind of like pigmies and Kenyans look so similar. I'll prove to you on a future post how Neandertals developed their traits -- including their bone structures through a nonrandom mechanism.
1	Excellent post DamEtel, I'm continually impressed by your very knowledgeable and thorough contributions here.  The response you received was exactly what I was expecting.  When faced with evidence so powerful that a pseudoscience cannot even be developed to offer an alternate explanation (ID theory, flood geology, etc..), the reply is inevitably baseless if and buts, or the old standby -   The Lord works in mysterious ways.   To actually face the data head on would present a fundamental challenge to one's faith and religion, and that, as I'm sure you're aware, will be avoided at all cost.  Waxy
0	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?
1	Horrible conclusion, drawn from premises known to be false.
0	And the religious have killed many millions more because the others did not believe in the "right" God.
1	So why did we spend 600 billion on the Iraq war?
1	This is a false dichotomy. We are limited by the English language on this subject as  beginning ,  before  etc all reference time. Time is just a dimension of space-time however, thus something could have existed  before  (in a non-time sense) the beginning of space-time. So we might have had an absolute beginning, a partial beginning, or no beginning.
1	So it's shifted from "no new structures" to "I can think of a structure that can't evolve." Me too. Evolutionary theory says that some things are not possible to evolve. But new structures, as you learned, do evolve.
0	Maybe they did it on purpose? They push through the amendment to quiet the RR while the issue is a hot botton topic, but make sure it's unconstitutional so that it'll get shot down.  Just a thought.
1	Well I don't support ever using the death penalty but as long as we're saying there is the death penalty and allowing them to choose then definately don't have retrials. They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already. If they don't want to kill an innocent person, stick to life in prison.
0	You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views.

1	Start with the largest most powerful calibur you can get and physically handle. Then consider:Practice = lots of ammo. Lots of ammo = cost increase with larger calibur.Practice = responsible gun owner.Training = responsible gun owner.Large calibur = ability to stop the attack quickly.Small calibur = less likely to exit your target and hit someone behind it.Well placed shots from a small calibur are superior to a large calibur that missed.As a bare minium take a training course that teaches you to handle low light conditions and drawing from a concealed holster. When you need it most are under conditions most favored by criminals, e.g. from behind, up close, in the dark, with suprise, or any combinations of them.A good instructor will also inform you of all the legal implications of having to defend yourself, the implications of comming to the aid of other people, the legal implications of defense on public and private property, etc.Personally I have made the decision that I WILL NOT help anyone in mortal danger whom I do not know. The legal implications if you are wrong are very drastic. You can never know the complete conditions of strangers and how they got to be in mortal danger, for all you know the person who just pulled out a gun may be an undercover cop. Thus I will only come to the aid for friends and family whom I know and thier business. My personal decision.The guys at the gun store are interested with selling you a pistol with the highest profit margin. Not the best tool for you. Only way to find out is with trigger time and carry time on the pistol. So you may have to horse trade a few times until you find the right one.My personal opinion? A very small .38 revolver with more than one holster. Sometimes you need to carry it on your ankle, sometimes in your pocket, or sometimes on your hip. Plus a ton of ammo for practice. The ammo you spend on practice can soon cost more than the pistol.Los of inexpensive, reliable, and well built .38's. Not a lot of fun to shoot, but hey, this is a tool with a very specific purpose. Of course of you can deal with more, by all means upgrade to more. Your not going to place a sniper shot between the eyes of a felon. Most likely you will need it at night, very quickly, and at a little longer than "knife fighting distances".I use a .45 auto. I shoot a full size .45 for fun. Train with the full size .45, but I carry a compact .45. The compact has exactly the same shape in my hand as the large .45, thus when I have to go the the small .45 quickly, it will retain the same operation and configuration in my hand as the large .45. The large .45 has more fun factor, not a lot of fun to carry a big piece of steel on your hip all day.Plus I reload the .45 empties. The cost of a large calibur with reloading becomes as much as a smaller calibur when the ammo is store bought. The time spent reloading keeps me out of bars on week nights and my girlfriend more comforted.By the end of the day, after carrying even the compact .45. I wish I had a small .38. The most effecient solution I have seen was a friend who both had a .357 magnum and .22 of the same pistol. He practiced with the .22 pistol all he wanted and very cheaply. Shot the .357 magnum just enough to practice with the recoil. The .22 and .357 had exactly the same size, shape, and trigger pull.My $.02
1	You mean in the Bible alone. There are thousands of others.
1	Actually, the reason people dismiss the concept of a diety is often not because of 'lies', but because there is no objective evidence of any diety what so ever.
1	Not at all true. They secrete mucous, they do not melt.  As for the absence of some verses form various versions/editions of the bible - I have had that problem too, and not just with quotes form  infidels.  For example, many versions have 're-interpreted' or re-translated' various verses to reflect certain political views and ideologies (which I find disgusting). For example, I have heard of a version that now singles out  abortionists  as evil-doers, and I have had a hard time tracking down online bibles that contain the actual KJV of Luke 14:26 - many have removed the word  hate  and replaced with a more conservatively correct  love less , which is not even what the original Greek was...  So, not being able to find certain verses does not mean that they are made-up or otherwise inaccurate, it may be that various versions have altered/omitted some of them...
1	No need to change the verbage:   ...individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments.   Like folks who migrated to northern latitudes and happened to have lighter skin(variation) were healthier and therefore produced more and healthier offspring. Over generations the lighter skinned came to dominate the group while becomming lighter still. Why is that so difficult? No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced. They just weren't as successful in the long run.
1	And if they do? Is that as big a crime as an ID advocate making his case in a science classroom? The fact is, the influence of evangelical atheists can’t be kept out of the science classroom, because no consensus exists on just where the fact/philosophical line is drawn. If a teacher or a textbook cross the line in the slightest way, time consuming distracting religious/non religious discussions can follow. 
1	If you have evidence for something, what purpose is faith with respect to that thing?  Faith is belief with no evidence.  Or from the dictionary: Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.  If you verify something scientifically then is it even possible to believe it by faith?
1	It is entirely possible for a man armed with one hand grenade, and yes, hand grenades can be bought, to not only take out a tank, but kill everyone inside. All one would have to do is catch a tank on patrol, while it is at idle speed, jump up on the tank and toss the grenade down the tanks barrell. The explosion from the grenade would cause the shell in the tanks barrell to also explode, and then the rest of the ammo in the tank, and wallah, dead crew and no more opperable tank. As far as a plane is concerned, almost all of todays planes are controlled by computers, at least the guidance and weapons systems, so I would try to bring a plane down with a simple computer. You tell one planes weapons to target another plane, and boom, one less plane. Or one might dig a trench with which to trap a tank, and after a tank falls into the trench and gets stuck, you kill the exiting soldiers, pull the tank out, and now you have your very own tank. Of course, none of this is full proof, but it is highly possible.
1	So, everyone who dies in a stabbing/beating/shooting is just, stupid? Maybe they wanted to die? Trust me, if there were alternatives to getting killed I don't think many people would die of crime.
1	There are some minimum requirements, though. The brain have to be able to receive stimuli and input. That happens during the 26th week of pregnancy, when the thalamocortical tract developes. Otherwise, it is no different than a computer that is turned off.
0	Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? Is this some kind of hybrid model? Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation.
1	In principle, there is no difference between the two as the result is the same, a dead baby.
0	hmm. really, I think it is. and so does the pope.
0	Actually, I have a better idea. We're getting all out of sync with our replies and it's going to get messy - my fault, I introduced too much ground to cover in my OP. Pick a subtopic - say the interpretation of fossil evidence, or the plausibility of common ancestry between chimps and humans given their modern forms and lifestyles, and we'll focus on that. The other points we've raised and challenged, we can put on hold and refer back to later.
1	Well, you just don't understand.  Now, instead of one long stretch of missing links, we now have two shorter missing links, one on each end.
0	Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.  (Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)
0	I know that the soul exists, which is why I made my claim. Just as sin isn't a man made concept but a reality that is proven whenever you feel guilty for doing wrong. I mean only sociopaths feel no guilt when sinning, are you saying that you're a sociopath?  What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year?
0	Ouch. This must hurt (him, of course).
1	Actually, mutations accumulate in both populations.
0	Bigots will be bigots. The parents oblivious to their heterosexual privledge. You are right they would never have objected to a story of a prince and princess getting married. The double standard is outragious and an example of their heterosexual privledge.  I don't have a problem with removing all gay issues from the schools as long all heterosexual issues are also removed. So what are these parents that protested this book reading going to teach thier children about gay families?
1	Well the 'brain slip' seems to be permanent and deeply embedded. I have been waiting for someone to call the three million population statistic and point out the Republic has over 300 million inhabitants not counting illegal aliens and terrorist not known.Actually the "gun crazies" you mention are comprised of folks who harbor the same sentiments you do :) You fail to see the right to KBA about to be recognized in Heller and applied through the States by incorporation in McDonald. Being Constitutional will mean you will have to change or to move. Be aware that the Nations who ban guns for the common people are the ones making the news about mass shootings and cartel murders. You fail to note that governments killed far more of it's citizens in the last century than all the wars combined. Picking out anacronisms to garner support for whatever cause you support is so weak it is not a blip on the radar screen and could be easily solved by adherence to the Constitution. Just like you overlook the population to find a few abberations, you mistake the act and suggest this man was a law abiding citizen and an NRA member. Evidently your interest lagged and you didn't read his pedigree nor his past criminal history. A 'gun crazy' misses all of that in their haste to point fingers meanwhile overlooking the myriad of gun laws studied by CDC and the NAS found no benefit of any of them but here you are beating the drum calling for more of the same innefective nonsense and avoiding your responsibility to protect yourself, family and property and a third person as well. You completely shun the fact that the police have NO DUTY to protect you nor anyone else. Now that is not only 'gun crazy' but pure, unadultrated loon behavior. You might ought to read Gun Crazy BY Jacob Sulman I believe? You have all the tics of being a mental case who hasn't been certified yet.
1	This is probably true, however it was your challenge to present a non-material approach to a physical observation.  This has now happened; with regards pain. Challenge over.
1	Professor Heribert Nilsson, an evolutionist, writes:Is it really credible that random processes could have constructed a reality, the smallest element of which - a functional protein or gene - is complex beyond ... anything produced by the intelligence of man?When asked why did the scientific world leap at the Origin of the Species, "[I suppose the reason] we jump at the Origin was because the idea of God interfered with our sexual mores."Sir Julian Huxley‘Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social preconceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem. The stereotype of a fully rational and objective “scientific method,” with individual scientists as logical (and interchangeable) robots is self-serving mythologyARBITRARY ARRANGEMENT, R.H. DOTT, U. of Wis. & R.L. BATTEN, Columbia U., A.M.N.H., "We have arranged the groups in a traditional way with the 'simplest' forms first, and progressively more complex groups following. This particular arrangement is arbitrary and depends on what definition of 'complexity' you wish to choose. ...things are alike because they are related, and the less they look alike, the further removed they are from their common ancestor." EVOLUTION OF THE EARTH, p.602 Storrs Olson, curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History said:"The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion."
1	Well, I'm basing it first and formost on the states which passed ammendments banning same-sex marriage. The percentages in those states were almost completely lower than 80%, with perhaps one or two exceptions. This indicates that even in the least supportive states, 80% is usually too high a number. Unfortunately, I cannot come up with a good website that lists all of the percentages, but you should be able to look around. This was the least important thing I wrote in that entire post, so I'm not too worried about it.
1	Just a couple of points:First, I believe your characterization that it is the far-right that is seeking to limit third-term abortions is incorrect. There seems to be large support on these forums from both the pro-choice and the pro-life side regarding third trimester abortions. Likewise, the general public seems to have been so upset with the Supreme Courts decision in Stenburg that Congress stepped in and passed a nearly identical statute to the Nebraska law. That statute cleared the Senate with the support of 16 Democrats, and it cleared the House with the support of 63 Democrats.That is not to ignore the fact that it is largely Republicans that would go further than third trimester restrictions. I am merely trying to point out that Roe stands in the way of restrictions that we all support (third trimester), and thus we all should hope for legal reform in this area.Secondly, the slippery slope argument is common, and I will address it in more detail later. My basic point is that if we really do think that third trimester fetuses have a significant moral status (and I take people at their word on this), than we should work to reform abortion laws in the United States. And that reform, as I am trying to argue, must begin with the undermining of Roe v. Wade.Note that I have not yet discussed whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. I do plan on discussing the legal issues with this case. But as of now, I am only trying to lay some groundwork for why that discussion is so important. A lot of people that I speak with seem to think the law is so technical that it cannot be understood (or is too hard to be understood), and thus they would rather not bother with it. So, I am trying to address that. And I am doing so by simply saying "If one seriously wishes to restrict abortion in the third trimester (which virtually everyone seems to), than one must seriously consider the legal aspects of the issue."
1	Make up your mind. Above you were claiming that there is evidence of your god and now you are claiming that it is a matter of faith. My faith is something different from evolution. I take nothing in science by faith. Science is based on empirical evidence - that means the I can quantify it in some way. Of course, if there is empirical evidence for your god, then your god is not supernatural but just another part of the universe.But isn't it funny that you creationists always think that the worst insult you can throw at science is to call it faith? Sadly, you are unable to reject the dogma of the mythology of ancient, nomadic herdsmen. To assert that as science is certainly not thinking for oneself.
1	I see. You are claiming that this is the case with every single beneficial mutation in every species through all time? If that is not what you are saying, then what is your point? Suppose what you say is true half the time. Then the gene gets passed on half the time. And what if the mutation occurs in the larger male?
1	its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science, even though science's purpose is to study life. for instance, can life be defined as energy? can life be compared with energy? if so, then birth becomes as much of an enigma as death; is energy created too?  (not really addressing the debate, but more like raising more thoughts to debate on...)
1	Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of "creation science" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.
1	They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered."During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother's death as a result of exhaustion, dehydration, infection, hemorrhage, or convulsions. Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children, her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8. This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."
1	You can forget the loaded language including false notions of progress. Lifeforms are evolving by way of purely physical and chemical mechanisms.
1	In what universe is there a right to murder?  Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.  And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.  What certain activities are forbidden in public?  Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.  And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.

I guess you have some way of knowing that these criminals would never return to once again create fear in the home owner.

1	His point was criticism of people managing the numbers of their population with abortion. It also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations.
0	She should not have the baby in the first place, and thats what im saying. The only irresponsible move a 12 year old would be making is not having an abortion, as she is not physically and emotionally capable of raising or bearing a child.
1	Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon.  Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly
1	No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that "life is irreducibly complex" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like "pieces that happen to be fitted together". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!
1	very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.  where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause

1	**The darwinian notion has had no payoff. The fact of evolution, as descent with modification from one or a few common ancestors, predates darwin by hundreds of years, and is not the private property of materialism/mechanism/darwinism.The real "payoffs come from 2 sources--the understanding of inheritance that grew out of Mendel's inheritance theory, and the concept of dynamic systemic 'adaptation', as opposed to passive particulate 'selection', in evoltion.Have to go now.
1	Evidence?
1	And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically (read: deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with (for example) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time) in order to work.  I can't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards.
0	emoticon_xgood Hehehehehehe. That made me laugh, but you actually make a good point. They should have I AM JUST A THEORY written on them, otherwise kids will regard them as fact and then where will we be?
1	To clarify: is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named, or is it the states? By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it.
0	Heck, I'd be proud to have my name there, knowing I was doing the right thing. But I think you may be right; someone needs to report it. What I want to know is, why would they WANT to know where these people live?  That's kind of scary.  (Also, did you notice the obvious marketing appeal-to-sympathy tactics on the page he linked? The man with a baby implying it's his adopted son or something? I can hear the kid a few years from now:  Hey mom, did you know I was used by the gay lobby industry to lie to people and shamelessly solicit sympathy?  Good grief what a sham)
1	Public Schools in 3 more States are in the process of bringing a case to court  that will permit them to join those 5 States in dumbing down kids, via elimination of the word  Evolution  from all  Science  text books, while inserting religious mumbo jumbo called  creationism  into those  text  books.  There is no need to debate the ignorance shown in this forum. Simply look at the number of  views  for the thread here that asks how they fit all those animals in the ark, and you will find ignorance is self-evident.

0	I'm sure it is many a doctors' spiritual duty to relieve suffering, just as Jesus healed the sick.   Besides, who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan, like they have in Afghanistan? Not me.
0	So how can evilutionists have any confidence in carbon dating if they keep updating the calibration curve? Huh? :)
1	The original paper is here. Dr. Schweitzer uses an ostrich egg to compare the structure and layout of the vessels. The chicken comes in from a reacting factor that showed a reaction in the presence of the subfossil 'collagen' material. He hasn't changed it on this occasion, he's just not able to read context....  Oh, by the way AA, are you planning on replying? Or do you cede that fossil discussion?
0	Why on earth would a woman come out now, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago, when it was illegal, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about?  Why on earth would any woman do that?  When did official medical records become non trustworthy? The conspiracy theories and blinders that both sides are wearing are astounding.  Waxy  P.S. I think the whole thing is repugnant, and any real politicizing of it by the Democrats would be disgusting IMHO. However, Bush did open the door with his strong anti-abortion stance, and sometimes, when you make your bed....
0	Your question, which has been pointed out already, has a theological basis - God is supposed to have given us dominion over the rest of creation etc. But what separates us from other mammals (if we restrict the question to that class of vertebrates) is reckoned to be  self consciousness  - the human mind that can deliberate upon and analyse its own thought processes.
1	And you've failed to explain exactly how Heller was a blank check endorsement on schemes such as gun rationing. Explain exactly how the judges ruling that the Second Amendment is truly an individual right, how DC's ban on handgun ownership and their trigger lock requirements being unconstitutional, would in any way suggest that one-gun-a-month laws pass constitutional muster.  Furthermore how to you reconcile the effects of gun rationing, with the fact that such laws make it absolutely impossible to catch gun traffickers in the act?  Give us some straight answers or leave the debate!
0	Well yes.
0	I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.
1	The purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people. The people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not. When it is acceptable and when it is not. This is done in agreement, obviously not unanimous. Theses laws are created by the view of society at the time. Our society permits the ability to change those laws as our values change. You may call it murder, but you are wrong. There is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct. To suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others don't share your views. There is no logic in your argument it's pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that don't go your way. If you think your view is indeed the view that is best for the people then be thankful in the US the opportunity exists for you to effect that. I can assure you though lieing about it, sensationalizing it, bullying people about it isn't going to get many people to consider you. Please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights, or feelings or value of the fetus remember what I said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not. We make these laws for ourselves for that reason, because we do attempt to value life. That attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time, but it never will.I don't need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do I stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who don't see you being right. Nor would I justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable. If you don't like the law, then do something about it. If this is what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that, I suggest you find a to become comfortable with it.
1	Well, there's also carbon dating... Didn't you post something about a decay curve? Are you now going to deny the accuracy of that?
1	What difference would that make? The BATFE (E for explosives, their power grows) already knows you own a firearm if you've ever had a NICS check. They're supposed to destroy the records, but who knows what they do? Might as well let it be known you have some personal experiance in this area. Gives you better grounds for debate than 'Joe Foreigner' who has never owned or possibly even seen a real firearm in person. Being part of the crowd and looking in from the outside make big differences when it comes to understanding.
1	But private citizens run background checks on other citizens all the time. I rent property. I make sure my tenants aren't felons before I lease anything. I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon. It is just something I personally would choose to do if I didn't know the buyer I was selling to...
0	It's completely illogical.
1	I believe I read this in the paper a few days ago, but I think the ban will be similiar to DC's in that it will ban handgun ownership.  As for the constitutionality of this? Since when have the Gun Grabbers ever worried about the Constitution?
1	It's my way of posting a good evolutionist site to the Evolution v Creation forum.  The question merely related to the title of the link. Who would have thought a link with Cape Canaveral in the title would have so much to do with the Creationist/Evolutionist argument? It seemed more interesting than  Hey, here's a good site.

0	If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS (or some other legally recognized union) as married couples, why does it matter which  door  they come in through? They get all the same benefits, including the benefits that come when one partner dies.  What's the beef...except that you can't say that you're  married ?
0	And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it's all better. I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women.
1	Of course throughout the whole Genome Project, although they have searched high and low for the gay gene, and they know where to look, they can't seem to find it. But I wouldn't deny that some chemical screw up in the fetal stage of development might not impact the sexual proclivities in some human beings. But so what if that is true?  According to the bible, the sin nature affects all aspects of our lives from diseases to the aging process to unnatural proclivities to sins such as rape, murder, adultery, homosexuality, incest, susceptibility to sex, alcohol and drug addiction, and innumerable other activities of the flesh which declare that we are seriously flawed due to our fall from grace which was brought about by our original sin of rebellion against God by disobeying Him via Adam and Eve. So there exists no consensus at all which declares that the liberal/secular humanist interpretation of reality is in any way correct. But that doesn't stop your side from claiming victory as the correct interpreters of the non-evidence.
1	A divinely appointed prophet from the womb:  Jeremiah 1:5 &#8211; &#8216;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,  before you were born I set you apart;  I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.&#8221;  Psalm 139:13 &#8211; &#8216;For you created my inmost being;  you knit me together in my mother&#8217;s womb.&#8217;  Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother&#8217;s womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? (righterreport.com)  Stop the infanticide of abortion.
0	So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.  Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time, or occurring over the course of a month or a year?
1	actually i have a fuzzy theory on how the water on the earth could actually cover land. most scientist agree that the 7 continents were at one point one single flat super-continent (gondowaland, i think). after the continent sections drifted apart, only then did the himalayas and other major mountain ranges and ocean gorges formed. so it could have been possible that all land mass could have been covered by a heavy enough global rain shower, at least until it all drained off.  however, scientists argue that this supercontinent existed millions of years before noah, so yall can scrap that idea...  unless the scientists were wrong and the continental split happened quickly, while the earth was under water...  nevermind... like i said, a fuzzy theory
0	Perhaps Jitobear would like to write this person a letter stating she supported her mothers choice to end her life.  If she could go back in time and given the chance I wonder if she would make sure the job was finished.
1	It is also a desperate tactic because there are no other intelligent arguments. It is really a "non-tactic", and merely just a re-statement of their position: "I am opposed to changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples in the marriage laws because that would change the definition."It is semantically indistinguishable from saying, "I don't like the idea of same-sex marriage."When objectively assessing the pros and cons, there are no valid arguments against same-sex marriage, except for biblical admonitions (which are not really objective, anyway.)
0	You are joking right?
1	What pattern?  The numbers don't add up in your favor. There are millions of concealed carry holders who have done absolutely nothing wrong. More than 100,000 who behave themselves at all times, for every one that does something illegal.  In the world of math you lose.  How about every dead individual in Chicago, shot to death in a city that doesn't allow for handgun ownership? Have you no feelings for the victims of crime that were murdered because of the agendas you support?  You support the criminals being left armed while their intended victims have to wait ten days for the paperwork to clear before they can take possession of their private property.  Either point out the supposed cover ups, or shut up and go away.
1	NOt true,California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal.
1	Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose. I'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion. And of course, mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection.
0	Just wondering if you are going to respond to the OP (as it was addressed to you to help you to understand something).  If you ask me I'd just ignore the negative comments that some posters make toward you. Just focus onexplanations of misunderstandings and constructive criticism.

0	What a crock. I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy&#8482;. It's usually you who is responsible for shutting yourself up.
1	No it can't. Scientific theories aren't  proven . You can observe the fact of gravity but you can't  prove  that the theory that explains it is correct. In fact, the theory of gravitation is one of the least secure theories of modern science.
0	Lets start simple then, I teach you the first thing you need to know. It isn't just a behavior. Being gay is about emotions, not behavior. As soon as you learn and understand that first rule, I will suddenly have more respect for you.

0	Just because something is genetically predisposed does not mean it has a positive benefit, but I never said that it did. Homosexuality is different, because it has no negative reprocussions that are not caused by something social or religious.
1	The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.
1	But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).
0	Oh Good Grief! It sounds very like you are extremely unsure of your manhood to be so threatened by a funny little story.
0	Not too wordy as much as too BS'y.  Ok, how about...currently legal physician inflicted murder of unborn humans?
0	You said in the other post "A sign like that would hardly be nessecary where I live. We have very restrictive gun-laws and hardly anyone owns a gun.And no, people does not discipline themselves. You might claim I have to much trust in the government, I would claim you have to much trust in your fellow man. When you give freedom to the people you give freedom to criminals too. I don´t trust guns to only be used in 'selfdefense'.I want my government to uphold justice and to protect me from criminals. That´s one of their purposes. And that is impossible without a certain amount of control over the citizens."This is liberal.. you believe governments are smarter than people. You do not trust your fellow man you trust governments made up of men. You are willing to restrict my freedoms based on activities of criminals.You sir are a liberal.
1	So the local police did respond.
1	Yes. That is one component of evolutionary thought. But there is more to it than that. Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static (as far as the fossil record reveals) for long periods of time, sometimes millions of years. Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly, in a flash of geological time, maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years. Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population. Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them. They agreed with Darwin. Finally, in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin, Dobzhansky, and Mayr. I think their paper, in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events, was published in 1972.
1	In this case I'm afraid it does.  (1) To see if the OJ scene would once again playout.  (2) To see a ruling made on behalf of an unborn child.  All the rest is one dumb killer, IMO.
1	And you have been so kind as to prove my point. Obviously you fail to understand. I can recommend some books for you to read to educate yourself a little. Let me know. At any rate, after extensive reading of the opinions of creationists such as Mr. Kent Hovind and Ken Ham, we truthfully characterize the creationist knowledge of science when we say:

1	Which are based on old information. The SOHO project (with which I was indirectly involved, and know some of the participants) was launched on December 2, 1995 specifically to make high precision measurements of the sun, especially the oscillations of the size of the surface, which indicate details of the interior. To quote them:Is the Sun expanding or contracting, and at what rate?(For an overview of the controversy over solar diameter variations, I recommend John Gribbin's pre-SOHO book, Blinded By the Light: The Secret Life of the Sun, published in 1991)The Sun is not currently expanding or contracting to any measurable extent. It may in fact be shrinking or swelling, but we have no hard data with which to conclude that.It is vibrating, however:http://helios.tuc.noao.edu/helio.html(Global Oscillation Network Group)http://soi.stanford.edu(The Solar Oscillations Investigation)In addition, we expect that the Sun will someday expand into a red giant phase, but that won't be for another 4 billion to 5 billion years or so. SOHO FAQ So, have you worked out the length of a day would have been 1 billion years ago?
0	Your concept of there being no God is an irrational claim, that leads, inevitably, to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise. I copied your words as it may be easiest to for you to understand the point I am trying to make. The use of God is a rational assumption. Your use of there not being a God is an assumption. By definition of reason, it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image, our "intellectual faculty" would also be made in His image. Thus it is rational and logical. Hence, the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical. While evolution says we are accidents, and hence, our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets (i.e we would be irrational and illogical). After reasoning, the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical.As you can see from the definition of reason, it depends on your starting faith or belief systems as to what conclusion you will come to. Another word for this faith is assumptions.
1	My bet is I know more about it than you do. I am aware of the "big picture" because I know that evolutionary biology doesn't apply the the origin of the universe. Please explain how the origin of the universe applies to genetic information. Why does a change in a population of organisms require an increase in information?
1	2) Even if we accept the statement "Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance [about 543 - 525 million years ago]" (note the * ... wonder what that material says), it still doesn't address the appearance of the vast majority of species, or of higher taxa like genera and classes. Why are there no robins, eagles, vultures, chickens, emus, frogs, turtles, lizards, alligators, sharks, carp, perch, dolphins, whales, seals, foxes, rabbits, cats, dogs, deer, antelope, zebra, horses, kangaroos, elephants, bats, monkeys, chimps, humans, and so on in the Burgess Shale or other Cambrian strata? Evolution has a perfectly reasonable, and supported, explanation. But if God created all animals on "day x", then we should expect to find all types of animals - elephants & humans & mice, trilobites, and dinosaurs of all various sizes and mobilities, for example - all mixed in the same strata ... but we don't. (PS: And "flood sorting" doesn't resolve this problem with the religious, Creationist position).3) The Cambrian "explosion" was not really a sudden explosion, but more of a extended event. A recent article (The Early Evolution of Animals, David J Bottjer, Scientific American, August 2005) describes a bilaterian - a bilaterally symmetrical animal - found in strata that is dated to between 580 million and 600 million years old. That's roughly 45 to 50 million years prior to the beginning of the Cambrian explosion. And the author adds ...

1	We call that a strawman, here. You have much to learn. Let me explain. A militia is a group of armed, ordinary citizens who gather. There are all these "militias" running around screaming that they're a militia, but if my town was attacked for some reason, the citizens could just get some guns and gather on main street... to form a militia! Now do you understand? If so, I expect you to ignore me. If not, then you're hopeless. I can't get much clearer than that.
0	You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them. Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.

And what's so funny about it is I'm sure none of these articles make mention of this being a huge controversy and how it gives ammunition to creationsits: they just play like dissent doesn't exist.  How does protein last 68 million years? Anyone who believes this is out of their mind.

I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be.

Gee I wonder how much money was wasted on this foolish study and brain washing.
1	Yes, it means the kind of regulations that would be necessary to create an effective militia, not necessarily those aimed at protecting public safety. And it is because groups like the NRA don't advocate such legislation that Cornell says that neither side is interested in protecting or returning to the original right to bear arms.

1	http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_state.htm(there is a lot at the above site that I don't agree with - I use it because I feel that the best place to get an undisputed description OF the opposition is FROM the opposition)Studies of the origin of the first life form, the origin of the earth, and the origin of the universe DO form a large part of intelligent design. Of the several "different scientific diciplines" refered to above, they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design, and that's undirected, random, happenstance processes. For purposes of this debate, can we come up with one general two word phrase for the "different scientific diciplines" - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design, which "theory of evolution" is clearly not? How about "happenstance origins"? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science, you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design doesn't fit. Does "happenstance origins" fit the same criteria? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design, there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins. If intelligent design isn't repeatable, happenstance origins aren't repeatable. Other scientists can't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist, and on and on. Evolutionists imply that with time, they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins. That's no more (or less) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design. If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science, why can't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science?

0	Gee our reasoning challenged one has shown up. Let me see we have a NY slimes article on the problems liberals have caused in children. Then we leap to they never grow up. And then the leap to they get guns. Wonder what study or studies back that up? From there we go into male hatred mode via hormones. Of course these are all white kids too eh? Not to mention being of the Republican persuation no doubt. 
1	Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me. In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?

There is no need to debate the ignorance shown in this forum. Simply look at the number of  views  for the thread here that asks how they fit all those animals in the ark, and you will find ignorance is self-evident.

But to apply Geology to a false science such as evo is to corrupt it and will no doubt be proven to result in false conclussions ln many areas of its application.  So much for this thread that was started in order to bait and mock rather than seek to learn or actually teach anything.

In some sense it's understandable how poor quality it is, given that it is from a  youth  wing of the communist party, and as such targetted at propagandising towards illiterate teenagers - but why post such a thing here?

It's a board similar to this one, only a large portion of the posters there are actual professionals in fields like evolutionary biology, etc (I beleive we have a few scientists and teachers here - I'm a Geological Engineer myself, but not even close to the large amount of experts there). It's really a good place to educate yourself in evolution and various other fields (I know I've learned a lot there).

1	Evidence isn't peer reviewed.(*-see correction below)Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what's peer reviewed.And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't "proven" anything. The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered. The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians. 
1	I think the definition of human, in context, would be a person that is alive. Dead does not make them human in this context.  Scientifically, human may mean Homo Sapiens, but there are other methods of defining humans. One of them is their capacity to love and to worship. Worship is not seen in another animal. Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed.  Either way, loving and worship are behaviors and as my psychology prof used to say....... Dead people don't behave.

Students for Life of America (SFLA) today released the video which was made at the Feminist Majority Foundation's annual Women's Leadership Conference held at the National Education Association (NEA) on March 9.  The video reveals Dr. Tiller showcasing massive and graphic pictures of children with fetal abnormalities that he had aborted, so as to make the case for late-term abortions as necessary medical procedure. SFLA's Executive Director Kristan Hawkins, who videotaped the conference and interviewed Tiller clandestinely, commented on the gruesome pictures of aborted children Tiller showed, saying,  One had an extra arm: could not that child had survived and received corrective surgery? Was violently killing the child the only way to go?

Not because they don't know how to think (some are quite intelligent), but because they don't have a plausible theory to support their ideas.

1	Why do you apply the term evolution to these? Do you, deep-down, believe that these have resulted from evolution too? You are not alone in making evolution an absolute all-encompassing world-view... Oddly enough Close_slave_can denies that anyone does this."Evolution is not alone in its naturalism. All science, all engineering, all manufacturing, and most other human endeavours are equally naturalistic. If we must discard evolution because of this philosophy, then we must also discard navigation, meteorology, farming, architecture, printing, law, and virtually all other subjects for the same reason."http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601.htmlHowever, the influence is not all one-way.."We live under capitalism, so we have capitalist science. We want to bring a different set of values into being, to bring about a new set of ruling ideas—ideas of a society without rulers, a part of a different ideology or world-view. We want to bring about a socialist society. It will, if we are vigilant, have a socialist science. I can imagine it, or some of it." SCIENCE IS SOCIAL RELATIONS at http://www.human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/sisr1.html"The major political task is seen as showing the reality of capitalist domination in the apparently neutral science"http://www.human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap100h.htmlIn capitalist societies, the influence of money-ideology helps shape evolution in a dialectic relationship."In short, the triumph of Darwinism implied the death of God and set the stage for replacing Biblical religion with a new faith based on evolutionary naturalism. That new faith would become the basis not just of science but also of government, law and morality. It would be the established religious philosophy of modernity." (Fr. Seraphim Rose, “Genesis, Creation and Early Man”, p17)

1	Well to start its a theory not a notion. Secondly if everybody already agreed on common ancestry with modification as the means whereby the species arose then why did anyone every think Darwin had anything new and novel. Simple explanation is he explained HOW such descent might be accomplished in a rational and testable context and provided significant evidence and analysis supporting his scheme. In other words his basic scheme coheres while the alternatives fail to do so.

Because I don't know him enough to assume anything about him. But I will make general statements on the effects of gay marriages on children.I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men.A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay.Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1% of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents.

Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.
1	Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.  We're waiting to hear about three or four more.  As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want.

This would be the equivalent of someone going up to the person behind the counter and saying they don't want to share the Starbucks coffee house with people who work blue collar jobs, and asking for them to be removed immediately.  Such ideas date back to the era of open racism and a lack of rights for black people. Simply because the policies are being enforced in a colorblind manner doesn't mean that it's not still racist or evil.

1	Cannot be demostrated? What? The very fact that it is called the Theory of Evolution suggests that it is scientific by nature.   Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion. Religions are made up of people who believe in something and ask for no proof and ignore evidence to the contrary. Theories are made up of people who believe in something based on logic and much consideration with all evidence taken into account. Theories more closely resemble facts than they do religion IMO.

Only you anthropocentrically expand your psychological understanding of connotations of words pertaining to human social systems to all other systems, everywhere. But that is, of course, what you guys did when first you applied the term 'selection' to the behaviour of abstractions and other non-human entities, so no big surprise there, I guess.

1	I think you could get by without teaching evolution in schools. I don't think it would be a thin edge of a wedge where kids are only taught things not easily teach yourself. Science still should still be taught and I would say most of it is hard to teach yourself. You can teach genetics and why lamrack ideas were discredited etc.
1	Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I don't agree with this. I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena, only speculations as to what (if anything) may have happened before the Big Bang. If anything did (eg previous Big Crunch) that is not outside time, that is only time that is inaccessible to us in terms of observation.

Therefore once you leave Chicago city limits, the gun ban dissolves and you can buy anything the state sells.

Face facts, their ban is useless, unenforceable, unconstitutional, and unjustifiable.

1	I'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species. The Canid species, specifically the Gray Wolf, or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.The evolution of the domestic dog The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places. Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations, and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool. A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22. The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.In comparrison, the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative, the coyote, by about 4% of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24. Dogs are gray wolves, despite their diversity in size and proportion; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25.

1	To me,  Theistic evolutionists  is an extreme contradiction. I mean, either you have faith that the Bible is the true word of God or you don't. I don't see how you can pick and choose what you care to believe out of the Bible. How can one believe in the miracle of Jesus' birth and resurrection yet not believe that Adam and Eve were real people? I find it a contradiction to somehow believe that God is great enough to create the universe, yet He somehow needed billions of years to do so. If God is all-powerful, then His words should be all that's needed. To me, the world is proof that God is all-powerful. The beauty and complexity is just staggering.

We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from  simple  organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.  You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.  It is this that I am refering to. It is the interpretation about the origins of the evidence that all the debates in this forum are caused by. Sorry for any misunderstanding.
1	That is true, but it is still a Nylon Bug is not a Nylon Horse... mutations can occur laterally [intra species] but not ascending [something entirely different].
1	But doesn't Genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period (though the days could be symbollic)?
0	Poll: Most Want GOP to Keep Fighting on Health Bill  The 41% MUST be the Tea Baggers huh!
1	The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it.

1	So you really do believe that organisms "are equipped with a means of making small errors that allow natural selection" turn a reptile to a bird and a monkey into a man? To be "equipped" means there is a design feature. You are betraying your belief system. The errors can only be arbitrary and random and the organism is not equipped to function in any predetermined fashion.In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. What was truncated? ... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL...*
0	The bible tells me to take it litterally. What more authority do I need to follow?
1	Nope, rather I'm suggesting you consider her an easy target because you didn't want anyone else interjecting -- you wanted your prey to remain without more skilled allies.
1	False. Random mutation and natural selection have been observed in the lab using bacteria; in some cases the researchers even determined exactly which mutations in the genomes produced the advantageous changes.
0	"Supposedly"? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it.
1	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails
1	You know, I heard that from my mom last week. My parents moved to Arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. Mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have.  Ironic indeed.
1	And yet the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center can come up with only a handful of incidents where a concealed carry holder assaulted another. Not even 300 incidents, as opposed to countless hundreds of thousands of concealed carry holders who have never done anything wrong. The math speaks for itself, you lose this one as well.
1	No they don't. We didn't have a tyrannical society back in the 1830s when without a doubt personal autonomy didn't exist for some. The thing is, you don't have absolute personal autonomy now either. And it still doesn't answer my question about where the right came from, you just said there had to be one.
1	Check the link again. Holder specifically stated that he wants both registration and confiscation. It's not slippery slope paranoia when the enemy comes out and broadcasts it to the public.
1	Are you refering to Japan or some hypothetical police state?
1	Can't say.
1	I would agree, except that there are situations where the data supports two ideas. If it appears to support both ideas equally, what do you do?
1	Well this doesn't answer my question though. With this bill, where is the money coming from? Are we cutting doctors jobs? I hate to use a Krugman thing but this looks like an  underpants gnomes  theory.  1) Pass Senate Bill  2) ???????  3) Save $3,000 per capita.
1	If you says so.http://www.publicagenda.com/issues/f...ortion&amp;list=16
1	I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term "god' as it pertains to reality.2. When you mention science and history, that implies you are interested in reality.3. There is no evidence to support mythological deities, god or God or Odin or the easter bunny.* So, yes THERE IS NO EVIDENCE of the existence of any mytholgoical gods.** Yes, there is no evidence that the universe was created, or if that statement even has meaning if the universe always was, and always will be.p.s. There is easter bunny.-Mach
0	Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.
0	Yeah, all the theologians who've puzzled over this problem for centuries have just been bad Christians in the clutches of atheists.  -sigh-
0	If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?
0	My wife had stage 3 Ovarian Cancer..She was treated by and OB/GYN Doctor who saved her life........He did not perform abortions...........  Abortion doctors murder the unborn..that is all they do..........
0	Ok, this does seem like one of the weaker arguments as to why there is no evidence for god... but it's like this... Some people's idea of god is all loving, and all knowing... and well you know. But if that were the case we would expect there to not be th
1	Actually you don't know what circumstances went on. However, it would be better if you stuck to the topic. Unless you feel compelled by genes to perform ad hominem at every opportunity.
0	Just so you don't shoot them!
1	Anybody who thinks guns have a phallic aspect is obsessed with sex and needs serious mental help.
1	Actually, you can.  You can get a cap and ball revolver via mail order LEGALLY.
0	Atheism is a lack of belief. Does a lack of belief in gremlins make a person an agremlinist? Is agreminlism a religion? Is ateakettleinorbitism a religion? If I maintained a  doctrine or belief that there is no omni-everything Invisible Pink Unicorn (mhhnbs),  is that a religion, too? If so, can I get tax-exempt status?  You know how the saying goes: If atheism is a religion, then bald is a hair color.
0	So what? They aren't worth anything, are they? Does it matter if we kill them? No, in your reasoning it doesn't because there are no absolutes.
0	hey D,  i am not going to get attitude w/ you.. i don't see a piont in getting mad at you
1	No....that is incorrect. Divorce has been around for centuries and was used in biblical times when a woman or man cheated on their spouse. Same sex marriage has never received any good stamp of approval in civilized societies.
1	You're off on the wrong argument, clearly stated above is the issue of an indivudal pharmacists refusing service, a service that the pharmacy offers. If the employee picks and chooses who to service, based on religious reasons, it looks in black and white to violate the law, state and federal:The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to "full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin."  Are you suggesting that's not how the law reads? Or are you still attacking the straw man you set up i.e. forcing a pharmacy to stock specific goods....which is indeed ridiculous, both to bring up and to defend, neither of which I'm doing.The law will of course be interpereted, as will the actions of indivudals, but it's clear that if discrimination is involved on the basis of religion, it is a legal issue.-Mach
0	Then, how much money should spend on the war on terror? Should we bankrupt the country to do it? Is it necessary to spend so much that we go bankrupt, or is it better to wisely spend the money we have and to fight an intellegent war against terror?
1	And what, exactly is "it" that "Darwinists" got wrong?
1	No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.   This was not a legality issue, but an education issue.
1	Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize (lie) what God actually did, for God was done with everything then started again. THe stories don't parallel each other they intersect.
1	To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted). Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world...
1	 A pretty important ?  Actually, not really. The ToE has evidence from all over the various domains of life. Human evolution isn't too much more relevant than bacterial evolution.
1	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.
1	That is the way military people abbreviate their designation of rank.  Leo's, not military use seargent. They call people 'civilians'. When they get paid by the DOD and have to abide by the Geneva Convention then they can, until then who are you to be arbiter of all things, grey or black?
1	There's nothing magical in the word "marriage." Just because one is called that doesn't mean it's any more legally superior than a "marriage substitute" (as you call it). Splenda may not be called "sugar", but at the end of the day (or should I say the morning) it still does just as good of a job sweetening the coffee. They're both sweetners. Why should we change the composition of sugar just so you can say the sweetner-composition YOU want is termed 'sugar?'
1	True but this progesses nothing twoards a conversation because you have no told me the nature of such an existance.  You have said if A is then A=A.... thats saying a lot without saying anything at all because you have failed to provide what A is.
1	Well, obviously the past few years of reading around the subject and quite a few more years of software engineering experience all contributed to this particular light-bulb clicking on, so I wouldn't read too much into the abruptness of the final epiphany
0	You and Bob just can't seem to contain yourself everytime I post, can you? It's becoming quite a pattern. You two should get together for tea sometime.  I never said Portugal was perfect, now did I? But I've been there and it's certainly a lot less flagrantly sexual in it's culture than the U.S.
1	I will answer the remainder later as I am pressed for time. Archaeopteryx is not a transitional form. It has well defined feathers. Where is the evidence for transition from scales to feathers that is predicted by evolution. Natural selection in particular but overall evolution.  If you read Gould's original work he does not say what he says above and in fact actually contradicts it. It appears like a response that is back peddling at best.  As I said, more later.  EF
0	Your love of assumption is quite amusing (it also highlights your inability to argue honestly). All I did was point out that accidents are a cause of injuries and fatalities dealing with firearms. Nowhere did I suggest banning them in the slightest. Furthermore, I specifically noted that most of the accidents were due to improper gun safety. So how about you take the stick out of your XXX and stop assuming whatever the **** you want for a change? You are a joke Isly. About time you admit it.
0	Ah, see, that's the thing. I think about it enough to understand it. Clearly, you don't. You don't understand a damn thing.
1	That is so non-specific as to be nonsense. How is that comment relevant to any discussion that has gone before? Who has ever claimed that body parts are made up by placing one gene on top of another. I suspect that the remark is the direct result of your ignorance of the topic.
1	So what? The allele frequency, even in your example has still changed. A change in an allele frequency in a population over time is, by definition, evolution. What did you think that evolution was?
1	Yes, this is what I'm saying.  The  soul  and the  spirit  are the whole point of the bible's existence.  if it can't be plain about what they are and what to do with them,  then either god is a terrible author,  or (and this is the one you'll like) we are terrible readers.  Either way, god isn't making the instructions very clear.
1	Actually...I do believe there ARE laws against people wearing masks in public. IIRC, some locations even have laws against adults wearing masks in public on Halloween.  But, as to the story...Yes, cops are IGNORANT and DO LIE ALL THE TIME.  But, what's new?  As for a trunk loaded with assault rifles...  I've done that several times.  Just not to an airport.  I hope he sues the city and I also hope he (or someone else) takes CA's anti-gun laws to the supreme court.
0	Because they have evolved beyond a desperate paranoia about their fellow countrymen.
0	I believe I said I would change my view. I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic.
1	Yes, it is human, biologically. However, it isn't a human being as it isn't alive.
1	Oh, so now you admit that you realize that the book isn't an exhaustive review of his entire belief system. Earlier you wanted to use lack of information against him...
1	See, here is the example of how..out of touch you are. Of course it could be dangerous. I have not only been gay bashed once, but twice in my life. The first time coming out of a bar when I was in my early 20s. I was beaten by five guys with baseball bats. My head swelled 3 times it's size and I was out cold for 4 days. I had "nike" imprinted into my skin from the bottom of their sneakers.The second time, I met a friend for dinner at a local bar. We met at about 7pm, had a drink and as we left the bar to go to a diner I was body slammed by two college kids running down the street. Broke my collar bone and was knocked out. When the owner of the bar came out he asked...do you think this was a hate crime. We have been having some problems. The world is not a safe place for gays and lesbians. We never know when we will be someplace where we could be assulted. You, jyoshu, live in dreamland when it comes to gays and lesbians. That has been shown to those of us here in the board a thousand times over. YOu understand so little of what being gay is about.
1	Could be phrased in a more polite way. Probably the whole name of this forum should be changed from creation versus evolution to creationism versus alternatives. Because every creationist I have seen on this board has used the creationist definition of evolution which non-creationists flatly reject and it wastes time. The replys to this very thread show that many people know the correct defintion of biological evolution and do not tolerate any other definition. If someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the "evolution of the universe" because it will just waste time.
1	Well, yes, but this begs the question of whether, even assuming epigenetic inheritance is real, all individuals would experience the same epigenetic alterations.Now, I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance. But even if it were true it wouldn't do away with natural selection. Just as with basic genetic mutation, which isn't going to go away, one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to. This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on, preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others.Of course, if the claim is that epigenetic alterations are somehow directed by the environment, i.e. are teleological in origin, then the onus is on the advocates to demonstrate how this direction occurs. Until they do, there is no reason to suppose there is any direction at all.
0	To be fair, my understanding is that Southern Baptists do now support black civil rights as an organization. Churches are much more loosely affiliated with it than in other denominations, so the denomination can't really control what individual churches do which are southern Baptist in name. That's what I've read; maybe someone who IS southern baptist would better know.
1	i will correct you since you are wrong.  actually, let me just point you to a website that came from folks that have been fed up with entropy's comparison to disorder simply because it causes confusion, this website has nothing to do with creationism vs. evolution  http://www.entropysite.com/  http://www.entropysite.com/students_approach.html  here is another one  http://www.entropylaw.com/index.html  (this one may have been motivated by c vs. e but is no less accurate)  this page oughta confuse a few creationists:  http://www.entropylaw.com/entropyproduction.html
1	Same evidence, different interpretations based on different starting faiths.  We will use the Lucy type skeleton and the next supposed evolutionary progression Homo Hablis (for short hand, HH). CAT scans of the inner ear of HH showed that the semi-circular cannals, which determine balance and locomotion, are more like those of baboons than those of humans. This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.  Hence, the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model. This is just an example of what they may do with some fossils, IMVHO.
1	And because a few people of weak faith and limited thinking declare mythology to be history doesn't make it so. There is nothing logical about accepting mythology as fact. There is nothing to distinguish the creation myths of the Bible from creation myths of any culture.
1	So what if the author isn't arguing against gun control? At last, there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime.
1	Actually you could look at this issue in several different ways.Lets start with welfare.Lets say the mother of a newborn who is responsible to finacially and physically take care of her child gets on state aid and agrees to not take child support from the father if he chooses to *opt out*Okay thats fine and dandy but if you think the goverment is going to support HIS child bucause he chooses not to ,well HAHAHA YOU HAD BETTER THINK AGAIN! Anyways things will NOT be equal until a man can actually carry and give birth to a child.Comparring the right to choose abortion and the right to choose not to pay support are completely two different issue that are not comparable.A women has to risk her possible life long health to either choose pregnancy/birth OR abortion a man does NOT risk either in his choice to support or not.This issue doesn't even touch on abortion for rape/incest or health reasons of the mother and or fetus.emoticonXDonno seems to me a deadbeat dad is using the pro-choice position to get out of paying support when HIS body isn't even in the issue.
1	How about rationality? It is not the same as intelligence (which is more like 'mental capability' or 'ability to learn' as opposed to specific process of identification (the axiom of consciousness).
1	So your point is there are developed nations that are not developed because their government has little control of a part or portion of it? France and parts of Paris where the police don't go because of the mulims being one? Seems nit picking to me as you could say that about the USA also.
0	Which wouldn't make a darn bit of difference - apart from the tiny matter of women dying and suffering permanent harm, but don't let that bother you. you'll also have to amend the constitution to remove any references to bodily autonomy. get ready to donate your kidney!
1	Agreed. It does not matter whether abortion is included or not, it is unconstitutional for the federal government to be funding any of it. Of course, it is also unconstitutional for the federal government to be jumping in the middle of the abortion issue anyway since there is no possible way to read the constitution that would put abortion under the purview of the federal government. It is an issue for the states.  Woudn't things be simpler if we all just followed the constitution???
0	You know I'm not saying that.  Is there no alley you'd avoid given the chance?  Was she looking for trouble? Police would certainly want to know what she was doing there.
1	Actually I did not know what Nato had posted. I found it quite interesting. I know that when I and my wife attended church, I thought about that possibility. Someone who Hates us just because we go to church, and I thought about bringing the problem up.  I quickly dismissed the probability of something like this happening because right across the street, is the Fairview Police Station. However, this is exactly where things like this do happen. In places where one is not allowed to carry a concealed firearm.
1	Oh good grief newbies are all the same on this forum...  Honestly, how many times do you think I've heard the Exodus and Numbers quote on this forum given my post count and join date? Do a search on the Exodus one...easy to see that is wrong.  The Numbers quote has nothing to do with who or who isn't valuable to God. That's like saying counting people over the age of 40 years old means everyone below is not a person.

1	Well, now, here's the thing:A hypothesis of special creation of all things (such as is described in the bible) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today. For instance, there's the amount of non-functional DNA we share with other creatures, in particular the other apes. With shared functional DNA, now, one could make a case for economy of design, but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage DNA into two entirely seperate species?Then there's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed' bits than others for no readily apparent reason. A good example is the octopus eye, whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front, both anchoring the retina more securely (no detached retina problems) and avoiding the 'blind spot' mammalian eyes possess. There's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design.Then there's the issue of vestigial features. Vestigial doesn't necessarily mean 'useless', more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves, and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species. Ostrich wings, for example, may be useful for balancing when running, or in mating rituals, but they don't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes. Their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight, but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self-powered flight make them a vestigial structure. Again, what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer?Then there's the fossil record. Try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood, it just won't go. Paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers. Imagine, if you can, the delicate impressions of a spider's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them. Hydrodynamic sorting of fossils, or burial order, doesn't fit either, since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving (they weren't) and that all mammals are small, agile and fast-moving (they aren't).On and on it goes. If we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us, we have no explanation that fits. Special creation simply doesn't add up. With all creation myths falsified, what are we supposed to do? Just pretend the history of life on earth doesn't matter, or should be ignored?Evolution isn't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking. Evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that don't fit the facts, be they religiously inspired or otherwise.Now, you may hold your hand up and complain that we're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution. And that's fair enough; we generally don't, for two different reasons:First, it doesn't really add anything to the theory; it doesn't increase its power to explain what we see. So while you can of course choose to believe that's what's happening, it doesn't have any scientific value.Secondly, there's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it. For thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god. Now, if the bible had been saying all along - centuries before the technology existed to verify it - that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years, that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired, since it would contain accurate predictions (which no man could have made) about what we should find when we look into our DNA or beneath the ground. But it doesn't make those predictions. So why should we now pay attention when Intelligent Design evangelists do a 6000-year-too-late handbrake turn and invent a new faith-based explanation for the evidence? After all, they have no divine mandate to do so - it's the bible that's supposedly the word of god; they're just making stuff up as they go along.

1	While that may be true, it fails to show that reproduction is a requirement in order to call something living: that living things would disappear as a result of their not reproducing doesn’t show that they are not living before they disappear. [start: added 01/01/2006]In fact, even with reproduction, organisms - such as leopards, elephants, whales, and so on - will eventually die out. Does that mean that they are not living organisms now? Of course not.[end: added 01/01/2006]The “pro-reproductionists” second attempt, and improvement on the first, might go something like this: 
1	The first sentence is inaccurate, as is the first part of the second sentence. Therefore the quesion of 'are you not teaching your opinion, sir?' is moot. The theory of evolution has nothing to do with opinion. It matters not whether or not anyone believes in it. Evolution has been observed. There is no known evidence to suggest that evolution does not occur.
1	Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.

1	in defense of the fruit fly, why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment? what good does a 7th leg do?and about the experiment itself - please, ALWAYS post references. who did the experiment? when? under what conditions? how? assuming you were correct about the experiment, were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of, a large variety of fruit flies to begin with, random mating, etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies, did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that?and im sorry, but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution, you just need to go and look at it.
1	I believe science can indeed tell us when it cannot be considered a  person  as we define a person legally. No mental existence for the simple reason that the hardware has yet to form. Protecting  potential  persons is beyond the scope of our Constitution IMO.
1	The paradox on creation is that it is obessed with proving scientific concepts wrong without taking the time to even understand the basics of how it works. The analogy here is arguing that quantum physics is wrong without understand the basics of how force or momentum operate.

1	The Supreme Court ruled that the definition of  arms  may absolutely NOT, under any circumstances, be limited to 18th century technology, or any other cutoff point. This means that the man on semi-automatic firearms (misknown as machineguns because a 12 round magazine exists somewhere in the world) can easily be overturned. This means that the people living in DC will soon be able to own Glocks and 1911s and Beretta 92s, as well as AK-47s and AR-15s and M1As and Mini-14s and all other kinds of modern weaponry.  There's one reason, and one reason only that the ban of semi-automatics is still on the books, and it's because it wasn't one of the points addressed in the lawsuit. The ban on handguns in general was addressed, not the ban on the type of handguns. However this can easily be dealt with.
1	I agree that all other reasonably safe options (such as caesarian delivery, in womb operations, etc.) should be looked into before resorting to abortion in that third trimester. As with the example of the friend of jitobear, sometimes there is just not a reasonably safe option for a particular woman since her conditions might not allow those alternate procedures.As for the question of limits on the health exception, yes, the exceptions that are clearer to me are the ones that could ultimately lead to the mother's death or complete debilitation. However, there is also a gray region that I am undecided on.For example:- What if the pregnancy would lead to less critical loss - such as the loss of use of her legs or arms? What about one limb - such as the use of one arm?- What if the pregnancy would give a medium chance of loss - such as a 20% chance of paralysis?The gray region is harder to quantify and the moral balance gets trickier. Perhaps that is why this issue hasn't really been addressed specifically in law. Where decisions in morally gray regions are concerned, it is too easy to criticize them and politically unwise to venture into that territory.
1	Evolution = changes with in a living organism. As explained on other threads. It does work off and stem from other origin studies. Secular biogenisis is filled with evolutionary tales. Cosmology uses these changes to qualify there theories.  Evolution has everything to do with morality. If evolution as it is currently held is true than man has no moral responsiblity to another man. We are only living organisms in a line of changes. No goal no origin, only meaningless existence. Therefore no law should ever be passed. Why would one ape in the jungle rule another ape. While territorial they are not governing.

1	"The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia. In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private. The public had a claim for public purposes. Coxe was a strong Federalist. He was employed in Hamilton's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion. He expressed no concerns that the enrollment and inventory requirements of the Militia Act would infringe on right of the people to keep and bear their private arms."http://www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html#coxeSo Tench Coxe put quite a bit a faith in the power of the militia? George Washington and Alexander Hamilton didn't agree. They thought that the militia was no match for a regular army. "Regular troops alone are equal to the exignencies of modern war, as well for defense as for offense.... No militia will ever acquire the habits necessary to resist regular force.... The Firmness requisite for the real business of fighting is only to be attained by a constant course of discipline and service. I have never been yet been witness to a single instance that would justify a different opinion."(Letter from George Washington to the President of Congress- September 15,1780)"Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is itsnatural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the nationaldefense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have lost us ourindependence. It cost millions to the United States that might have beensaved. The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance ofthis kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such asuggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular anddisciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of thesame kind." -Alexander Hamiltonhttp://federalistpapers.com/federalist25.html

1	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.

0	Other posters on this thread have much greater knowledge in this area than I. I would like to drop the science briefly and address this very beginning of SS's post. One should always ask why people behave the way they do. Therefore this post raises some questions for me:* Why would these "world's greatest minds" behave the way they do, continue working to keep the population "snow-blinded" (whatever that means)?* Are all evolutionary scientists working in concert to achieve this ruse?* If a motive exists, other than the pursuit of knowledge, does this extend to other scientists?* Is all science a sham?

1	Yes, really.  Lungs from swim bladders? Takes millions upon millions of years? What's so crazy about that?  Again, minor changes over sufficient time add up to what?  What makes you think that lots of little changes can't do the job (apart from incredulity, that is)?  Where is the barrier to stop minor changes adding up to big changes?  Where did you get the idea that a dog evolved to a human? It's exactly that kind of comment that makes people with a smattering of scientific education say 'go read a book on biology before you say that dogs evolved into humans'.  Humans did not evolve from dogs and ToE has never suggested that this is so. It's that kind of comment that makes me wonder how much you know about biology. My nephew knows that humans evolved from human like ancestors; not dogs and he's only 11, for Christ sake!
1	Don't quote yourself.What did I just say? Nothing is ever proven, except in math.But, yes, papers are published all the time with loads of evidence pointing to the fact that birds evolved from dinosaurs.Alligators were not dinosaurs when dinos were around and still aren't.Neither are monitor lizards. Btw- monitors started appearing right as the dinos died out, but they were not and are not dinos.

I think we're still waiting on an answer...
0	I've said more truth on this forum alone than you could ever hope to comprehend. Of course, overwhelming your comprehension probably isn't hard at all, so perhaps that's not saying much.

I won't rule out a combination.
1	As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity.
1	lol, therere lot of  disorders  that dont prevent people from doing anything. if being blind is a disorder should they disallow blind people from getting married?  other than that, you'd be hard-pressed to classify  being gay  as a disorder  but in any event, just classifying something as a disorder is hardly every good grounds to disallow it. look up affirmative action (im black, by the way, just in case eyebrows start raising)

1	Please define complexity. Please define information. Both definitions should be relevant to biology.
1	The word "evolution'" generally means change, not "advance", so we can speak of "stellar evolution" or the evolution of a planetary surface. These are each large fields of science with many people studying them. The "biological Theory of Evolution" is completely different. From my viewpoint coming from the physical sciences, at the present time, the "Theory of Evolution", which is the study of how genetic material changes over time, has become so completely validated by making so many accurate and useful predictions, that it can now just be considered biology.What most creationists seem to be disputing is just science, since they don't specify, and use the term "evolution" too broadly.
1	How about rationality? It is not the same as intelligence (which is more like 'mental capability' or 'ability to learn' as opposed to specific process of identification (the axiom of consciousness).

1	HOLY XXXX! half those guys have their jaws missing! so, are we to believe that we evolved through a period of eating only mud and other mushy products that we only needed to swallow or lightly grind against our top teeth to survive upon?!Yes, that was a joke...I thought there could be a little humor in here, too, right? I mean, we can all actually agree that both viewpoints can be intellectual, right?Oh, and Lurch, God did it.
1	You are getting to a more complicated area where "mental existence" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as "self defense" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before.

1	Gee, gives the impression that Dr. David M. Raup, Curator of Geology, Museum of Natural History, Chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely oneÂ’s belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific.  But thatÂ’s not at all what Dr. Raup was stating. While Googling for a fuller quote, I ran across a page that showed how this Â– and many other Â– statements by Dr. Raup were distorted by Creationists.  To start with, here is a fuller quote:

1	Then why can’t you explain an unreflective fertility and abortion rates between 1972-1979 here in America or how the Polish fertility rate never increased after the 1993 referendum that criminalized abortion? Prove to me when criminalizing abortion has ever decreased it’s demand. So far you haven’t…only provided empty rhetoric. The pro-life movement thoroughly brainwashes it’s supporters to believe such jibberish. 
1	So in short the best case scenario is we go from $6,000 per capita to.......$6,000 per capita. Basically this would mean less care for the already insured and more care fore the under insured..well, some of them.  This seems optimistic to me.
0	You know, I'd believe that more if there were people like the Shindler family who have pushed for federal courts to intervene and destroy the sanctity of marriage. There is nothing you could do or say that would convince me that Americans somehow have any respect for marriage whatsoever. What heterosexuals have done to destroy this institution from the inside out only tells me that heteros are simply spoiled children who have the attitude of:"If we can't make it work, we aren't going to allow anyone else to come in and do marriage better."
0	So are you saying that the people of India aren't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered? Are you saying that the people of India aren't seeking changes so they can arm themselves accordingly so if something like this happens again they'll be better prepared to handle it?

0	Police are a reactionary force. Most effective in traffic control and revenue collection.  Police do not have the ability to be where gun related crimes occur. They do not have ESP. Most Americans live many miles from any source of aid. Either in rural or suburban areas. City dwellers have officers in their vicinity but officers are hampered by crowds and traffic. Your assessment of rights versus duty is correct. But if we want to be safe, we should assume the duty.
1	I agree. I wouldn't have minded Bowling so much if he had either made a documentary or made a commercial film. In the end, the message wasn't that bad. For all intenst and purposes he said exactly what the pr-gunners have been saying for years, which is that guns don't kill, people kill. Now, he took a kind of roundabout means of getting there, but that was more or less the conclusion of the film. Our society is a messed up place and people are scared. I am not sure that he is right that they have no reason to be (just look at our crime statistics).Watching the film, it almost looks like he set out to make one movie then ended up making another. The first 2/3 of the film certainly seemed like the message was "guns are evil". It wasn't until the end that you come to the revelation that his message is not "guns are evil". The sensationalist methods he used in the film, IMHO, pretty much strike it from the "documentary" list.

0	Stop trying to muddy the waters. I was talking about developed nations with lower murder rates. You suddenly bring Chicago into the debate- a city with open borders in a nation where guns are freely available. Even if gun control hasn't worked there it doesn't follow that gun laws can't work on a national level. 
1	For the final compilation, yes, but the vast majority, certainly the Gospels and the first few Pauline epistles, were widely accepted long before that, and were regarded as authoritative in the early 2nd century. By all means quibble about 2 Peter, Hebrews and Revelation but don't try to claim the books of the Bible were selected politically in the 4th century, it simply doesn't fit the facts.

1	Oh dear. We once again see the fallacious 'information' argument being used. The craters on the moon give us information about past impacts, do we demand that information has a 'sender'? Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars, do we demand that information has a 'sender'?  And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information' has a sender and recipient, genetic material has...neither. It's just chemicals and forces. Nothing more. There is no identifiable 'sender', and there is no identifiable 'recipient'. Sure, you can chuck a god in here or there if you like, but that's not where the evidence leads. DNA is not a code, DNA is certainly not a 'language', and it only falls under the definition of 'information' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does.  This is pretty much meaningless without elaboration.  Meaningless analogy as you are talking about deterministic chemical reactions, not the equivalent of  1000 books  whatever that is supposed to suggest - for example, in the context of chemistry, how do you know that a reaction  equivalent to copying 1000 books  is difficult or uncommon?  Well, no, as evolution is not a random process, but then you wouldn't know that would you?

So can women can cure themselves? Is that what you mean? Or do you mean that once they forgive themselves they can move on to help other women do the same?  thanks in advance...

People would probably go across the bordor and get abortions there...you might have drugs from canada come over that cause abortion but there is no reason to believe this will  clog  up the jails. People need to realize that is was only 30yrs ago that abortion was pretty much illegal (in most states). Did you see prisons flooded ? no.

1	Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated. If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea.

Why's that?What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?
1	Well not exactly. The article addresses some commonality in humans and chimps with regard to altruism exhibited toward chimpanzees who are not known to the chimp exhibiting the behavior. The point was to draw a possible parallel between human altrusim which is known to go beyond mere kinship selection and the chimp behaviors which also appear to go beyond kinship-selection. The discussion goes to the fact that humans and chimps share a common ancestor at the point where humans and chimps went their separate evolutionary pathways. One possibility is that such a common ancestor may have had the capacity to also be altruistic to individuals outside its kinship group. Or of course that chimps and humans both developed their respective altruistic behaviors independently after the branch point.None of this negates the concept of biological altruism in the form of kinship selection which a geneticall based effect. Indeed the article recognizes that chimps DO exhibit kinship selection effects!There is of course no reason at al that one cannot have kinship selection as well as other motivators for altruistic behavior. So its rather premature to take kinship selection (which I think is what WW means by genetic altruisim) off the table just yet.The article certainly does not draw the same conclusions as WW would have it do. Once more the rabbit hops over the actual work to his own preferred conclusion. SOP for the lagomorph.

0	Why on earth would a woman come out now, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago, when it was illegal, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about?  Why on earth would any woman do that?  When did official medical records become non trustworthy? The conspiracy theories and blinders that both sides are wearing are astounding.  Waxy  P.S.

1	Cannot be demostrated? What? The very fact that it is called the Theory of Evolution suggests that it is scientific by nature.   Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion. Religions are made up of people who believe in something and ask for no proof and ignore evidence to the contrary. Theories are made up of people who believe in something based on logic and much consideration with all evidence taken into account. Theories more closely resemble facts than they do religion IMO.
0	sinjin - I didn't mean to imply any linkage between your opinions and those of another poster. Apologies.
1	But why are they so passionate about whether they are right or wrong.  I think there is no real good or evil but it does not really matter to me if I am right or wrong. Their seems fairly clear to me why they think it is so important to fundamentalists that everyone has the same opinion as them. They clearly state or imply that people that don't share their beleifs are throwing all ethics and morality out the window.
1	This is where intuitive, ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble. All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions, so it's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else, right?Well, let's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens. Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour, and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly. Should he be allowed to sit in judgement? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position: by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race, we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race.Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy. We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence. Ah, but! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition, another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted? One might protest that it is not, that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically. But it would be in vain, because there are, after all, no such thing as 'brute facts'. The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic. To someone whose presupposition is otherwise, your 'facts' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased, or at least faulty in some unknown way.In short, following Ken Ham's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight. We can venture to justify no opinion or belief, because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another. I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself, and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument, for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are, in Ken's eyes, inviolate.This is hardly the result Ken could have intended. What's gone wrong? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly?The answer, of course, is that the playing field isn't really level.Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly, and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place. The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed. This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates, and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma:Good axioms yield accurate predictions.As Ken rightly observed, known facts are always subject to interpretation. But the reverse process, the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory, is not. In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find. This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality.This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal. The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant, but his low 'hit rate' would invalidate his axiom.So, part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that, in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark. The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible, as should identically located retroviral insertions. We should not have found fossils at all, let alone a nested hierarchy of forms. We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation. We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies.All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact. Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we don't know about; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past. But these rationalisations entail further predictions: we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can. If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we don't. If fossils were laid down by the flood we wouldn't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth, or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains, and we wouldn't expect there to be anything like as much limestone. If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years, we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air. And so on.Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions, predicting something we didn't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed. And that's the bottom line: Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge, but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions, indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality, Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur.
1	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.

0	And...  You're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance, the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric, is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S.  The constitution was written after the declaration. Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration, they could have, yet they didn't, did they?  Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand, trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal, which it is, in the U.S., right now, should not be allowed.  TIP: Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise, else, your entire argument is just as flawed, which it is.  Abortion is legal, for the right reasons.  A conscious, human, U.S. citizen, has rights.  Cells, without consciousnes, that are not citizens, do not have rights, are not individuals, and are not humans.  You can jump up and down, and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance, but it doesn't boost your debate credibility.  -Mach

0	I believe many of the intellectuals behind the  pro-life  movement (and rest assured it is the intellectuals, not the masses, behind any political movement, whether it be pro-life or instigating a communist revolution) are not opposed to abortion per se.  Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.  For this reason any method of contraception poses the same threat to them as abortion does, though some methods may be easier to rally support against than others.
1	Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?

1	Abortion is about pregnancy - and whether or a not a woman wants to be or can sustain a pregnancy - physically, emotionally and economically.  Nobody has to be a parent. That is why there is adoption, safe-haven laws, the signing away of parental rights - and oh yes, an ever growing population of dead beat dads.  I am still waiting to see proof of all the mourning dads due to women having abortions. Most of those women are desperate and alone - or have the blessing of the father.

1	This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could "micro-evolve" from a few ancestral "kinds" on the ark.
0	So essentially the good thing about religion is that it poses a question that may or may not be completely meaningless and then invents a happy-making answer to satisfy the curiosity thus engendered? Wow, that's so much more profound than eradicating smallpox.
0	Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT.
0	A facinating way of framing it I should say. I could simply reply that pregnancy is preventable, that it is not a permanent condition and if one is patient it will end with the child's birth. I could also point out that the fetus is not responsible for the pregnancy in that it did not decide on it's own to come into existence and plant itself in the mother's womb but rather it was the mother and father that made the child through their actions so why is it made to pay the ultimate price?

1	Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given..."Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria." "All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme"http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.aspTalkorigins gave their usual doubletalk"Whilst this particular case does not "prove" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution."Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..." In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantagesBut, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain? If nylon eating bacteria was "proof" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source."http://www.christianforums.com/t52336
1	No, it doesn't. The big picture of evolution is that it is the observed change in the heritable characteristics in populations of organims over generations. In cases where populations become fragmented, the separate (reproductively isolated) segments of the population will accumulate genetic differences. The longer they are separated, the more likely it will be that they will be unable to interbreed if united. This is observed. The result is the establishment of separate species.
0	And what does stop you? You could decide that for yourself. But that wouldn't make the action just or moral. That action would still hurt people, and it would still be evil.So perhaps I should ask, if God were not threatening religious people with Hell, would they still be good people? Or are all of the selfless and generous actions of religious people stemmed from the selfish desire to get into heaven? If they are not stemmed from their own selfish desire to enter heaven, then they are they not rooted in that individual's own desire to help others. This exists in some people.For those in whom it does not exist, we have the law. We create governments to do that which is in our best interest and that which is in our best interest is that which helps everyone. For that which harms someone else might soon be that which harms us.I have oversimplified what is a very complex understanding of morality, but the point is that the morality of an atheist does not begin with the desire to enter heaven, it begins with the desire to help others or create a society which will help everyone.
1	It is called the 1st amendment under the freedom of religion, under the 14th with equal protection, and the full faith and credit clause.  As I have said many times before I would be alright with marriage being limited to breeding age heteros because it would then exclude heteros also. However as long as non breeding heteros, and heteros past breeding age can get married then gay people must have that option also.

Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.

However I am not really arguing whether pregnancy in and of itself is punishment, I suspect that is an opinion matter - there are some crazy women who actually liked pregnancy. ;) Julie - however clearly feels that it is acceptable to use a pregnancy and parenting in a punitive matter against women she feels are irresponsible.
1	**  A bit more on the number of [supposedly] 'random', 'spontaneous' mutations involved in the evolution of the ability to metabolize nylon waste.   Some more background, in Flavobacterium there are four nylonase genes, nylA, nylB and nylB' (which are duplicates) and nylC, carried on one plasmid. In Pseudomonas there are two nylonase genes (nyl A and nyl B, homologous to the nylA and nylB genes in Flavobacterium) carried on two different plasmids.    from--http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/apr04.html  The link continues with rationalization of the eubacterial heuristic mechanism for molecular adaptation, i.e., its plasmid dna system, as if what that system does is stochastic rather than heuristic, i.e., random rather than systematic.  The fat-headed pomposity of the ideologue voicing his opinion [Ian Musgrave]is really quite comical.
1	Actually, his definition of evolution is exactly correct. In fact, I notice that you even acknowledge that he is correct in the last sentence of the paragraph. If you knew that his definition was correct, even if it is the definition of biological evolution, why would you state otherwise? Don't you think about what you type before you type it?

1	Almost?  Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.
1	There are two major theories, many hold to the "Out of Africa" replacement model.The perspective of the Out of Africa model (often called Out of Africa II, referring to a second migration from Africa of a hominid population) adherents is that when there was a migration of H. erectus out of Africa into Asia and Europe, these populations (seen in materials like the Chinese and Indonesian erectus) did not contribute a significant amount of genetic material to later populations that led to modern humans (some claim no genetic ancestry to these groups and their descendants at all, a "strict" replacement model). At approximately 200 kya there was a second migration of hominids out of Africa. This time it was fully modern H. sapiens, which proceeded to replace whatever populations that then occupied Asia and Europe. Some see direct competition and extermination of the native populations, some see passive replacement due to better adaptive strategies, and some see genetic admixture with the preponderance of genetic material coming from the incoming human populations, eventually replacing and assimilating them into the greater collective. In this view there is a specific speciation event that occurred which led to the origin of H. sapiens in Africa, and this population is the forerunner of modern humans, leaving the European Neanderthals, Chinese erectus, and others out in the cold.Homo Sapiens
1	The latter does happen, though not often enough to explain evolution. Again, your're bending over backwards to exclude one part of the ToE, but you're using other parts of the ToE to try and do so. And you can certainly 'say' whatever you like; what would help is some evidence.
0	Well ... that does tend to happen when you waste time arguing the obvious as if it were a rebuttal to anything. Maybe rather than being argumentative to the point of arguing over things that are pointless and that no one disagrees on, you could thoughtfully discuss things that people don't see eye to eye on. You might get better results from people that way.
0	So lets say that if, and I know this has nothing to do with the topic of gay marriage, but do the people have a right to amend the constitution to introduce slavery? Does the majority have a right to deny a minority freedom? I already know you answer. You believe in the tyranny of the majority.Why do you want the people to vote to take other people marriages away? I do not understand your reasoning on this. Besides you have never answered my question.Do you have any compassion?
1	There are more people who live together as couples now than say 20 or 30 years ago.  If you are a middle aged man and do not realise this then you should get out more..if you are much younger then you can take it from me or google the relevant phrase.  Whether there is much difference between now and a couple of years ago...dont know.
1	Kids can get teased for all sorts of reasons.Mother is too ugly.Mother is too hot.Father is a sanitation worker.Father is one of the teachers.Even family is too rich can be a source of teasing...I think a better solution would be to target the bullying / teasing itself, for all situations...
1	You can have Russia and China, but Hitler was very much a "christian."
0	Oh yeah, like the televangelist shows. Come on, get real. Maybe they should give God credit for things because He is omnipotent and omnipresent. Maybe because He created us to love Him and serve Him. Maybe because He has blessed America in so many ways!

0	The most anti-family people I've come across are those who beat their breasts, demonise gays, and pretend they are  for families . They don't give a damn about children, all they care about is their homophobic religion.
1	Because you seem to lose sight of that with your whackjob ideas. Case in point "The manufacturer would have to know where to point LE" now you have the manufacturer involved in law enforcement. Would you have the big 3 involved in pointing out to LE who last bought their products involving drive bys and vehicular homicide? You have no clue as to how the whole process works yet you are going to put your oar in and muddy the process. Here's a small lesson for you. The manufacturers of firearms don't sell to dealers. They sell to distributors who in turn sell to dealers. You are still lacking any valid proof that the law abiding are the problem. 
0	I only wish it were so simple.
0	Are you implying that an entity with reproductive organs cannot be holy?  Are you implying that reproduction in itself is not a holy process?
0	Oh, he doesn't want abortion, huh? If you take the Old Testament to be true, you just lied here.  Let's look, shall we?
1	This is not a part of the argument, though. Whether or not the woman can or cannot perform activities she wishes to do (which is not the case in pregnancy, btw, or at least varies greatly according to the individual) is irrelevant; it deals with the moral question of disconnecting someone who will die if they are not connected with you. The argument is equally applicable no matter the womanÂ’s mobility.
1	Doesn't count. Took place in a  gun free zone . By law no guns are allowed there, so by law this incident couldn't take place.
1	So, I assume that you bought all of the liberal demogoguery about the big health insurance companies making obscence profits on the backs of dying people?Here's a little factual info for you. There was a recent ranking on the profitability of a wide variety of Industry types. I believe it was done by Forbes. The health care insurance companies ranked 35th in profitability with an ROI of 2.2%. To put that in perspective, if the companies fired all of their employees and converted all of their assets to cash, they'd have made more money putting in in a bank and drawing interest. emoticonXRolleyes
0	Hi Boopee.  I don't know what to say. Never thought I'd be compared to Hitler. Yikes! Um, well, ya. So, I guess if you're interested, I'll give some reasons why I'm against abortion.  Here's some links to articles about it on Boundless (a webzine). (if you want to, just go to www.boundless.org and type abortion into the search bar)  http://www.boundless.org/2001/regula.../a0000567.html  http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000229.html  http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000230.html (read this, if no others)  I oppose abortion because....  a) I beleive the unborn is a valuable human being, and therfore abortion is murder  b) I beleive that abortion hurts women (see links)  Yah, those are the basic reasons.
1	Acutally global warming causes it to be hotter in the summer and colder in the winter, which is bad for any living thing.
1	So tell me....knowing that the human race is 99.9% the same, and that  No matter how scientists today scrutinize a person's genes, they can't determine with certainty whether an individual is from one  racial  group or another ....how can you justify how the racist scientists can hold up a skull and make judgements about it? How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes? How can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different  species  based not on their genes -- which are 99.9% similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull? Evolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing, monkey-loving, chance-worshipping, racist fools.
1	Right. That is the white morph in winter fur. Here it is in summer fur. And here is the blue morph in summer fur and winter fur. The fact is that some arctic foxes never are pure white. And it doesn't take a matter of months for them to change from dark to light. I spent a year where I saw lots of these animals every day. Remind me to tell you about Archie, who lived under the C Battery mess hall.But that's not really the point. Your clumsy bait and switch was beginning a discussion about evolution and then trying to represent the seasonal change in color of foxes as evolution. The ability of the foxes to change may be evolution but the fact that they do change every year and then back again isn't.
1	Evolutionists do not argue about light-years as it is not a part of evolution.  I donÂ’t know how the theories that Einstein developed could be used to show that a light-year is variable.  None of this has any effect on the vast amount of physical evidence that the earth is around 4.5 billion years old.
1	And just specifically what parts are those?  Mr. Bennett seems to think he is above the law, Canadian or otherwise.  I quote from Page 3 of my US Passport:
1	Actually, no, that is not what I said. I said:
1	Really? Let's consider the matter of Jesus' claimed virgin birth, a claim brought forth by Matthew long after Paul's time. Here's Paul on the subject...  Rom 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;  ...which suggests that Paul considered Jesus' conception to be fairly routine. EZ, evidence contained within the NT points to a gradual evolution of Christology over a considerable period of time.

0	So in other words your God put you on Earth to stop people from killing so your God could kill them eventually?
1	To me,  Theistic evolutionists  is an extreme contradiction. I mean, either you have faith that the Bible is the true word of God or you don't. I don't see how you can pick and choose what you care to believe out of the Bible. How can one believe in the miracle of Jesus' birth and resurrection yet not believe that Adam and Eve were real people? I find it a contradiction to somehow believe that God is great enough to create the universe, yet He somehow needed billions of years to do so. If God is all-powerful, then His words should be all that's needed. To me, the world is proof that God is all-powerful. The beauty and complexity is just staggering.

1	Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon.Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly
1	Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.
1	Sandy do you understand that if a star is one light year away, then we see the light from that star that left the star one year ago? So the star must be at least one year old.

1	Usually, but most of this has been quoted out of context by creationists and answered so often that it is an old story. Besides, as I mentioned, Feduccia has just published a detailed study on the embryology of bird digits. It supports his view, of course. I don't have a problem with that and it is certainly an issue worth study. My days of ornithology and embryology were long ago.Also, since those papers were published there have been several more feathered dinosaurs and primative birds discovered. Things are moving fast right now. Jeff Polling also has some information about the Ruben et al. article.But the "bird hip/lizard hip" bit is pure nonsense that demonstrates profound ignorance or intentional deceit. The correct information is so easy to find. That sort of conduct certainly casts a bad light on creationism.
1	The scientific method must stick to the measurable, observable and testable otherwise it stops being, well, science.  The moment you invoke the supernatural as a reason for a natural event is when the science has stopped- for example intelligent design will go some way with the empirical and then flip to the supernatural at the last hurdle. ID would say this is the eye, its structure has evolved through organism x->y->z we see in the fossil record and then say God directly shaped this design as it is too complex to have happened by chance, whereas science will say the eye was a response to a natural evolutionary pressure say from predation, environment and so on and is a product of natural selection.  The latter view here could be reconcilled in a number of ways with a religious beief, but the former can never be reconcilled with science.
1	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.

Spare us the tired michael moore government vs corporations rhetoric, it's obvious they're both on the same side. And if you didn't realise that after the bank bailouts, the only healthcare you're in need of is a lobotomy.
0	Yes, of course the past can never be proven.But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)

1	Oh goodie, same MO. First a biased claim repeated on Yahoo from canned propaganda source, VPC with a few quotes from staunch marxists that would like to ignore the Second Amendment and the entire Constitution, then you include the suppositions and dire warnings which have never come true but you are not finished yet. Your quote contains the usual lies about training and education plus an appeal to interfere with State Rights which 34 States have specifically stated their support of through their State AG. Not enough yet?  well it's a right  is no longer an argument, it is fact. Read Heller v D.C. and the myriad of cases including 35 Supreme Court cases that have always held the Second Amendment protects those individual rights. Even Roe v Wade states the rights found in the BOR such as ... the right to keep and bear arms  to be a fundamental right.  What you have is an unConstitutional right being demeaned by a person who swore an oath to protect and defend it...making them/him a traitor.

1	I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be "with" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist. 
1	Yeah, there is no species of that name.
0	So guns are more important than the safety of women? Then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?  So men love their guns more than women? Is that some kind of homosexuality? Ya know a gun is kind of shaped like, um, you know what. A gun does ejaculate in a sense.

In fact, we do not know the exact grounds on which he was declared a heretic because his file is missing from the records.  All the same, he was burned for being a heretic.

1	But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story.
1	look at it this way: the creation vs evolution forum is neither a science nor religious forum. science has a distinct forum, and so does religion. the issue of creation vs evolution is where the 2 interests bump heads, and the result og this overlap is massive enough to warrant a distinct discussion forum of its own.  there are a vast variety of other religious issues other than the genesis account, just as there is a lot more to science than evolutionary biology, paleontology and anthropology. likewise, there are many religious people, even christians, that have no interest in creation, as there are many scientists that do not entertain evolution topics, but neglecting either does not make them less of a christian or scientist respectively, in their views.  this forum specifically focuses on the debates between the area where these different ideas intersect. as such you cant separate the two.
0	Why do you want to approach in language of least-value of human life by reducing it in comparison to such things as a 'tumor'? Obviously a tumor is different simply on the basis that it won't be growing into a child and an adult soon (actually, never!). Why should the fact that something is going to soon grow into a child, adolescent, and adult not factor into whether or not life is valued? Is the pro-choice position so weak that what is growing inside the mother has to be described in terms of a 'tumor'? Jo is right--and yes, AA; you shouldn't have to not value human life just to have the pro-choice position. This attitude of reducing that which will soon grow into a person to the likes of a tumor is the very sort of thing validates some of the complaints pro-lifers sometimes make about the pro-choice movement. Why can you not be pro-choice AND value life?

1	But what is adultery?  Mark 10:11:  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.  Matthew 19:9:  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance. According to Mark, all putting away is adultery, but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him. Which is it?
1	You are correct, but contingency must be in place to deal with it when it occurs.Look at what happened in Eire with "Case X" in 1992- what happens when a country with the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe has to face up to the issue of pregnacy as a consequence of rape:http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/ireland6.aspPages 12-13 of this EU report (Adobe Acrobat reader required):http://www.newr.bham.ac.uk/pdfs/Repr...m%20Bremen.pdf

0	Yes, I'd say I do exist (to answer your question). Furthermore, I don't see why Matthew S has a problem with it....he is the one thinking we are  at war  and he states that he is willing to do the same things. I assume he finds this behavior during  a war  to be fairly standard and if the opposite situation had happened he would be all for it.
1	Not really. World forests are at risk for farm land and non-paper logging, not for paper which is being replaced by post consumer waste at increasing rates. Most paper people use today contains at least some recycled paper.
1	My point was that just because an animal has features that resemble different animals doesn't mean it has evolved from them.
1	 Dragged ? Why does the scientific community seek to drag religions into changing their beliefs? Can't they just ignore them?
1	Actually, it's not. The big bang theory is also science.What exactly do you think the big bang theory is? What evidence do you think supports it? What evidence is there against it? why do you disagree? What is your education in cosmology - in other words, why is your disagreement rational?
1	Well, it doesn't, so it isn't. Biology is well aware that many things have volition, and there are whole branches of biology dedicated to studying it. Animal behavior they call it. However, biology doesn't not pretend that every living thing has volition.
0	what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?
0	You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up. So sorry, but you struck out.
1	And like drugs, banning firearms would create another tax free black market, supplied by underground smuggling and manufacturing. Making a pistol with low chamber pressures, especially a semi or full auto firing from an open bolt, is no big deal to a competent machinist. Guns like the MC-10 are made mostly from stamped steel, simple to manufacture in a spare room. This all sounds like legislation of morality, proven to be impossible.
1	Nope mutations happen to individual cells. And hypermutation takes place and appears to be controlled at the level of individual cells also. You need to stick to the facts here.
1	Indeed he is. Good analysis there. The question of whether N was our ancestor or just a cousin has long been under study. At times as you point out it was thought to be ancestral at others not. At no time was any of this seen to have an impact on evolutionary theory as such, nor was there any reason for it to do so. Its a question of the evolution of a specific species (ie ourselves and N) and not a question of evolutionary theory.  As to modern Ns consider that they seem to have established themselves as spokesmen for a well known insurance company in modern times. They are quite intelligent and fast on their feet, but they seem never to have invented grooming. Its probably genetic. I also have observed what appear at first glance to be hybrids on a bus I used to take to work.
0	Now for the rest of the story from the local Newspaper:  ?I heard yesterday from a mother that in fifth grade in Nashua, they were given as part of their classroom instruction naked pictures of two men showing a presentation of anal sex,? Rep. Nancy Elliott, R-Merrimack, said during a hearing in Concord on HB1590, which would repeal the law legalizing same-sex marriage.City school officials deny sex claims - NashuaTelegraph.com  This is the issue and she is quoting a parent who reported this which we all know is happening throughout the country in public schools.
0	Just for the sake of argument, let's assume evolutionists had trouble explaining away the tongue of the woodpecker. How in any sense is creationism the alternative?  No explanation therefore God. What bloody rubbish. And why do the same people keep posting the same crapola on different sites under different names? Ah, yes. Created without a brain. The only logical non-evolutionary explanation.
0	**  This is the line that caused me to butt in, walking-fish. Again, my apologies, but prs has no idea of the difference between Lamarckian and Darwinian theory, and how that theoretical difference would be reflected in different social theories. As far as I can tell prs has nothing but preconceived misconceptions about this. I felt compelled to speak up. Hope you're not put out about my intrusion.
1	Actually, it isn't. It is complex and complicated. It requires diligent study of difficult concepts. But when you grasp the basics, it does become evident. But most creationists aren't willing to put in the effort.
1	No, Mega posted a long editorial from the guardian which was written after the police arrested the owner of a conversion factory. It's interesting that they claim the gun crimes stats have gone up, when all the sources I've seen show that violent gun crime has gone down. That's the guardian for you. It doesn't show that we have high crime rates whichever stats you accept.
0	I see. So what you are saying is that you are unsure about evolution and wish to explore it. Great. Then start with one of those unreasonable and dumb arguments and present it. Why are you more reasonable and not so dumb?It's easy to do what you have done. I can claim that invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky. I can claim that you are unreasonable and dumb because you disagree with me. But it is meaningless unless I am willing to show that I have a pair and can step up and show why I am right.Do you have a pair?
1	No. She (Ohioprof) is saying that for a person to not look like a complete disgusting hypocrite while arguing against gay marriage on the basis of "defending Traditional(TM) Marriage", that person must not engage in behaviours diametrically opposed to said "Traditional(TM) Marriage". The strawman you are attempting to construct is just that - a strawman.As to "the majority of Americans are against gay marriage", who really gives a flying emoticonXCensored? The majority of Americans thought that slavery was acceptable, that blacks and whites shouldn't marry, that "seperate-but-equal" policies were acceptable (and equal), that women should not have equal rights as men, that discrimination on the basis of gender, race, etc. was acceptable, and on and on. The "majority of Americans" have been for a whole lot of pretty emoticonXCensoreding stupid things. Your argument isn't helped whatsoever with your appeal to majority.
1	That's just great. You think it is cruel to abort a fetus when the life of the mother is in danger. So what your really saying is: "Oh just let the chick die, save that baby". It strikes me as strange that you don't think letting that woman die would be cruel, or that the baby growing up without his mother would be cruel. And there would be no reason to do it to a "born baby". If they are already born, you cannot perform an abortion. And I think it is sickening that in this so called "land of the free" that there would even be an argument against an abortion done to prevent the death of the mother, or abortions done in the case of rape. I would think that the land of the free and the right to choose would go hand in hand. And let me ask you, with your demented, self righteous views, do you celebrate your birth date or your conception date?
1	He has been published. Not on the Big Bang -that is not going to happen in America .You are either getting your information from propogandist or making it up yourself. he was a fellow at Los Alamos and Oakridge for more than a decade.Only an idiot would consider him a crackpot he is a brilliant scientist. He is presently involved in a lawsuit for being excluded form a scientific forum for posting his objections to the Big Bang.To you everyone who is not an atheist is a crackpot. According to you 96% of Americans are crackpots.Your comparing Gentry to fireworks man shows your bias , your inability to think for yourself or your total lack of integrity.
1	Nope, it just shows people are getting sick of having the anti-abortion movement invading their public life. Back in 2001, a pro-life group went as far to pay a pilot to tug a banner that held the picture of an abortion fetus while he flew over Southern California beaches. http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/701445/postsEver since 2001, the pro-life movement has adopted some odd and extremely unpopular methods of protest.
0	Really? From what university did you earn your science degree that makes you qualified to make judgements about what is science?
1	NO! There are facts present that cannot possibly be true IF SS's theory is correct! That's the point. OK, let's go back to basic deductive logic:True statements cannot have false consequences. In symbolic logic:If H then Cnot CTherefore: not HThat is, we have hypothesis H. It has consequences C. If you find that C is either not there or that there are consequences contradictory to C, then H is false.Neandertals and humans are lumped in one "kind" by creationists. Elephants and mammoths are another "kind". Now, if SS's theory is true, neandertals will have the same DNA sequences as humans, because it is a matter what genes are turned on and when, not a change of genes. (This is even more pronounced because creationists insist neandertals ARE members of H. sapiens). Same for mammoths and elephants. So now we look at DNA sequences. Are they the same? NO! Neandertals and H. sapiens differ by over 3 standard deviations from variation within H. sapiens populations. So, the consequences are wrong, therefore SS's hypothesis is wrong.No assumptions involved. Only data.
0	More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.
1	Well, there's tons of oxygen dissolved in sea water and you can't get it hotter than 100C. Done.
1	There are some minimum requirements, though. The brain have to be able to receive stimuli and input. That happens during the 26th week of pregnancy, when the thalamocortical tract developes. Otherwise, it is no different than a computer that is turned off.
1	Well, that may be your personal approach to 'Evolution by Intelligent Design', but I believe that most people [and the majority of human beings are not geneticists and/or molecular chemists] would say that 'biological evolution', [to their way of thinking and mine], is about whole organisms, not molecules.In fact, I'm not the least bit interested in debating what atoms and molecules do, in and out of a test tube. So if this is where this discussion is headed, I won't be around for long.
1	Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this:  My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject .  Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it.
1	1. When their mind develops and begins working. 2. When their mind stops working. 3. No, it should not, at least until its mind develops. 4. No, they are no longer living, and cannot exist without their brain.
0	because all children should have parents who want them dearly.btw, "moral relativism" is absurd. a phase people pass through as they discover diversity and is bewildered by it, thinking all are equally valid. it is a stance of both immature/superficial reasoning and moral depravity.
1	I see patterns here. My girlfriend and I have been debating this subject a lot lately. When we first started debating, she did so in "solid support of creationism" (yes Frog I did not write those words by accident). She said, and I quote, "Evolution is bullsh*t". Last night, after two or three evenings of this stuff back and forth (after I resoundingly bested her on every point, basically) she affirmed that she does believe in evolution and has "kind of" always believed in evolution, but that she has many reservations and questions about it.The pattern? "Solid support of creationism turns into an admission that evolution is the truth, but with reservations." I find that pattern a little bit amusing.Last night, she had abandoned most of her philosophical objections because I made the concession that everyone has to make if they want to make any headway whatsoever with a budding evolutionist who can't let go of their religious objections: "Okay, maybe it had God's stamp of approval." When you say that, you can move on to a real conversation. In this case, she bombarded me with a million questions that I couldn't answer. She seemed excited about it, not debating, but asking me about the wonders of biology with a long series of "...but what about this" and "...what about that" type of questions. One thing she keyed on was evolution as it applies to a larger ecosystem. I couldn't quite grasp what she was asking because I don't think she herself was very clear on the question, but to make a long story short, I got the distinct impression that she simply can't wholeheartedly accept evolution because she can't begin to fathom the complexity of the science behind it. I have told her time and time again: "Just because you don't understand something, that doesn't make it wrong." I see this same pattern here in your words, Frog. You're talking about wild collisions of atoms and saying that the foundations who donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to research know less than you do, because they're wasting their money. You're making this subject so much bigger and more philosophical than it has to be, Frog. Is evolution by far the best answer we have to the question of the diversity of species? The answer is yes, overwhelmingly so. Everything else is moot. It belongs elsewhere. 
1	Yes, because atheists love it when New Orleans gets drowned in water and thousands die. Hell, I know I'm throwing a party tonight, going to get my atheist friends over, and my pagan brothers to. Maybe a couple of beers, some dogs on the grill, all topped off with us ******* on a crucifex.  Grow up.
1	But, of course, this is true of any test question in any science class. No test question in science ever asks for an opinion. They all ask for answers that confirm a knowledge of the science. The law is meant to intimidate teachers. But if a student expresses a religious opinion on a biology test, that opinion is actually irrelevant. The only consideration in grading the test is whether or not the correct answer was provided. The student may also give an answer based on religious mythology, but as long as the correct answer is given, the student passes. However, if a student answers all questions in a class of earth science or life science with religious mythology, that student fails. He/she isn't being penalized because he/she expressed his/her religious mythology, he/she is being penalized because he/she didn't answer the question correctly. Students are not asked to express opinions, religious or otherwise, on tests of knowledge of science. They are required to confirm that they have a grasp of the science.
0	And you keep purposefully neglecting to add in the 'selection' part, which is far from accidental.  Your dishonesty and incompetence has not changed since I first encountered you on the old Infidels board so many years ago.  You were not so shy about admitting you were a creationist back then. What changed?
0	But science classes are for teaching science and ID has not shown that it is science. There is no evidence and no research has been done yet. It has been around for more than a dozen years and we are still waiting for any actual research to be done.

Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.
1	Thank the lord you are not a creationist (pardon the pun). The method you referred to above is known as deductive reasoning, and is known to be a very valid way of finding a solution even by most 3rd graders. Also, I look at the Bible as a written record of what actually happened as well as the holy book. Seeing as scientists have believed the journals of young Native Americans from a hundred years ago, I don't see the problem of believing the written journal of hundreds of very wise men and women, including God himself.
1	No, but some intelligence should be exercised when going to a court of law.  For example, the choice of the board on WHO to represent them.  Do you think that the judge will be able to totally dismiss in his mind that this group mission is to push a religious agenda?
1	And THAT'S why we have these things called judges - so they can rule such things to be unconstitutional. And yet, for some reason, you and your fellow anti-gay people are always complaining about judges doing just that.
1	Actually, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator. Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe (Science and Creation (Edinburgh and London: Scottish Academic Press, 1974)). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all? Loren Eiseley stated (Loren Eiseley: Darwin's Century: Evolution and the Men who Discovered It, Doubleday, Anchor, New York (1961):‘The philosophy of experimental science…began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation… It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.’C.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true (God in the Dock (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1970) pp. 52-53):‘If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our thought processes are mere accidents—the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else's. But if their thoughts—i.e. of Materialism and Astronomy—are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.’Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?
0	I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm asking if you'd think differently in that case, and you're not answering.
0	I might be missing something, but where in the article does it mention information flow reversing? I've been through it a few times and it still seems to be talking about the transcription of DNA, just bits of DNA that don't code for proteins.  At best, I can infer a suggestion that RNA contributes information as well as DNA contributing information, but that's about it. I'm probably just being dense; can anyone help out?
1	It isn't possible to tell. What is called the  scientific  approach is to analyse social statistics to derive probabilities, a methodology which assumes that the present is the same as the past, all well and good for the physical sciences, where the way particles behave does not change, but inappropriate in application to complex systems like people, that may react in ways totally unanticipated.  Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems, but the more ways you try to manipulate them, the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes.  So what do you do then, just take this method anyway, even given you can't predict the results, just take your best shot? When it fails, just say  oops, well, we had good intentions, we can't be blamed . If that's all we have to work with, we are truly screwed. There are however, alternative ways of deciding whether you should do something to trying to predict its outcome.
1	Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.
0	Let's research the quality of there Prisons, cells, food, routines, and the prison lifestyle that these lifers find so difficult to endure and copy it here so our lifers suffer the same depth of despair and hopelesness. Lifers shouldn't have access to TV, Radio, Newspapers, or even interaction with other Prisoners. They should be in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day with access only to the religious book of their choice if they want one. Life for a convicted murderer should be so hard that they pray for death over living like that.  But coming from the Italian Prisoners, It's probably nothing more than reverse psychology to lay guilt on the Politicians for better living conditions.
0	If the situation is that now, if a gang member wants to shoot someone, they have to go rent a gun before they can do so - that is by no means a miserable failure.  If you want to call this one a failure, you should be equally lampooning the recent DC statistics thread because the newly allowed guns haven't instantly dropped the crime rate to 0. So much for consistency...
1	the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years. And what's so funny about it is I'm sure none of these articles make mention of this being a huge controversy and how it gives ammunition to creationsits: they just play like dissent doesn't exist.  How does protein last 68 million years? Anyone who believes this is out of their mind.
1	Garbage pure and simple. Science is materialist and empirical by its very nature. A non-materialist science is a contradiction in terms and WW you are well aware of it. What you present as a threory is empirically false and you are well aware of that also.
0	Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt., that's why.  For you it seems to be about the word, and the govt. saying "oh, you use THAT term ("marriage"), ok we recognize it." For us it's about the commitment.

0	And you think that killing your baby doesn't cause any emotional and/or physical pain?
1	You are missing the fact that the theory of evolution is the explanation for the observations. Evolution does not explain itself. The theory of evolution explains things from the single genetic code for all living organisms, to the observed nested hierarchy, to the progression of life apparent in the fossil record, to why organisms seem designed for their environment. I'll say it again, because it's important and might clear up some of your profound confusion. The theory of evolution does not explain itself. The observations of living organisms lead to the theory of evolution. The theory of evolution is not a goal of science but a conclusion.
1	What, precisely, is a child? Is a zygote a child? Is an embryo a child? Is a little developed fetus a child?  When does life begin?  What do you mean by life?  Life itself began billions of years ago and has been continuously reinventing itself ever since.

1	Thomas favored incorporation through priviledges and immunities, correct?That likely makes the most sense but the Court probably feared how far that could go, since the logical conclusion is the abolition of individual State law. Not that the "substantive due process" is well defined, but likely the Court felt they could rein in any excesses through that interpretation.
1	No. Creatures don't evolve. Populations evolve. If a portion of a paticular species gets isolated and evoves into a new species, what makes you think that the parent species has to die?
1	But if there are too many dogs wandering around they do not change to be cats, or rabbits, or humans do they. They do not change so as to have eight legs and spider eyes do they. But yes development of the phenotype is a result of the genetic heritage interacting with the environment, but its not an intelligent process. If you starve a young organism to near the point of death and then rescue it with food it will not develop as if it had food when it needed it. It will not express its full genetic potential. The environment OFTEN changes the outcome of development by imposing limits on reaching the biotic potential provided in the genome.
1	And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy.
1	Well, in the sense that we cannot actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes, then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection.

Is this what makes a good family-man/Catholic; denying the rights of those who are different from what is considered by some to be "normal", and telling others what to do with their body?
1	And they would be correct.
1	No, no. You've got it wrong. For SS  scientific neutrality  means not accepting that something is true just because it's been proven by science. You have to put science and reason on the same intellectual footing as pure faith to acheive the  neutrality  that SS would like to see.
1	Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same.

0	And if people have a  religious belief  whereby they don't think blacks should vote, or that interracial marriage should occur, should governmental officials who have those  religious beliefs  just be allowed to ignore their duty?  What if I had a religious belief that prevented me from performing my governmental tasks for Christians? Should that be respected as well?  They are paid to do their job. People who get to pick and choose what their  job  should entail because of their religious beliefs should find another form of work.  If when I was in the military, I had suddenly stood up and said,  Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.   Should that be respected and I keep my  job ?
0	Maybe you'd be happier living in a moslem nation like Iran or with the Taliban.
1	Quite false.  The fossil record shows that life started as  simple  single-celled life - bacteria - about 3.5 billion years ago. More complex multicellular life did not appear in the fossil record for nearly 2.5 billion years. And then what we find are only very simple multicellular life forms, such as the simple bilaterian Vernanimalcula about 580 to 600 million years ago. A few million years later in the fossil record we find more complex organisms, like trilobites, but nothing complex like a reptile, bird, or mammal. Later we find jawless fishes making their appearance, followed by jawed fishes, then amphibians, then reptiles, then transitional forms leading from reptiles to mammals, then primates, and then humans.

0	But stress a child, it would be wrong to judge a child by the circumstances of its birth but as a developing embryo I do not think it can be treated the same way. Adoption may be preferable if possible but if someone is causing harm, albeit even unintentionally they are still responsible. The whole idea of manslaughter is based around this, without even going on to criminals being a product of their environment - they may have had apparently little choice in their crimes. This does not exempt them from punishment though - they serve to prevent future crimes or to stop the contining harm being caused.
0	What a defeatist attitude you have.
0	I know what your "point" was.I also know what you ACTUALLY ASKED originally.You asked: "Hey hypocrite, have you asked yourself how many millions of dollars every single pro-gay church spends each year promoting homosexual causes, including gay marriage and lobbying federal and State Governments directly in support of homosexual causes?I think we're still waiting on an answer...
1	I think the semi-tragic error supersport - and other strongly religious people - make when triumphantly posting links like this is that he assumes everyone invests their beliefs concerning the universe with the same degree of emotion and self-worth as he does. This assumption is explicitly stated on occasion, whenever 'darwinism' or evolution or some other scientific field of study is described as a 'religion'. To SS, the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented that contradicts ones beliefs. The idea that someone could respond to an upheaval or revolution in our understanding with excitement, anticipation or delight is entirely foreign to him.
0	Well, I DUNNO?!?! Did god do it!?!??!?!  Of course dinosaurs exist. There are fossils proved to be millions of years old, by real scientists. Why is it so hard for you to accept the way the universe was made? Why are you so afraid of logic?
1	Er, they are held to the same standards. ID fails to meet them. That's the point :)

1	I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood

1	And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
1	Well obviously it has to be something. It's not the mother, it's its own being. Hence, it is some sort of living thing. All living things have to be part of a species. Is the species "A potential human"?

Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.

The majority has always been looking for an excuse to harm homosexuals, to do evil, not because the majority is evil, but because the majority is misinformed and prejudiced. They twisted whatever event came their way into an excuse to cause harm. Or at least that is what I believe to have happened with many people.
1	yes, but adam wasnt created with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cells. adam was the prototype. any subsequent humans should be born following the fashion in which adam was made. otherwise adam could have been shaped like a goat and still bear human children, because god could have formed him into whatever shape or lack of shape he wanted, yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring. why should adam's children look like adam? wouldnt adam's children be born the way adam was created, or not?

1	From a developmental standpoint for the baby, there would have been no difference in killing the baby right before it exited the birth canal (a 3rd trimester abortion) and killing it right after it exited the birth canal. So I'm having a hard time understanding why you would think it to be preferable for her to have had an abortion. Of course I think they are the same because both what she did AND abortion murders the baby--its the same difference regardless of whether it happens before or after the baby exits the birth canal. But it seems to me that a consistent stance on your part would be to support her actions either way, because either way the mother has had her wish, which seems to be your top priority. Not that I agree with your thinking of course.
1	UK Civil Partnerships are not identical to marriage. There are a few small differences (and a heck of a lot more pages for the law books) because CPs are an entirely new entity. Most of the differences are minor, though I, and quite a few gay people in the UK, find one particularly insulting. CPs CANNOT have any religious component. Unlike heterosexual marriages which can be  completed  in a church by having someone  proclaim  them, CPs take effect upon the second signature, have no  proclamation  requirement, and cannot be  performed  in a church (though I guess nothing stops people from signing a document in a church).  It's a sop to the religious right and has quite a few religious folks angry that the government is seeking to dictate what can and cannot happen in a church.  more details:  http://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/lgbt/faq.htm  http://www.pinkweddings.biz/thelaw.htm#b  http://www.equalitycoalition.org/pressrelease.asp?ID=4  Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one.
0	Actually, I have a better idea. We're getting all out of sync with our replies and it's going to get messy - my fault, I introduced too much ground to cover in my OP. Pick a subtopic - say the interpretation of fossil evidence, or the plausibility of common ancestry between chimps and humans given their modern forms and lifestyles, and we'll focus on that. The other points we've raised and challenged, we can put on hold and refer back to later.
1	It depends upon the extent to which those two things (YEC and 'the science of geology') clash.  If, for example, you think that oil is in the ground because God put it there 6000 years ago, for us to find and fill up the atmosphere with, there's not much reason to be concerned with things like 'which rock type oil is normally found in'.
1	You are correct, but bear in mind it is just Bragg's introduction to the programme and not the opinion of the panel. This issue is explored in more detail when Dawkins talks about a population of self replicating molecules (27:00) and how the first life, as we define it would have arisen when there was concentration of these molecules and then the first cells- there is no suggestion of a single entity that was responsible for all subsequent life.  Thanks for the links on the articles btw.

1	In all fairness the Pharmacist does serve an important vetting role in the supply of medication to patients- they check what has been prescribed by the doctor against they know about and correct errors that are made (which do happen...

0	Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.

0	Because you people keep wanting one restriction after another after another after another. Nothing is ever good enough for you, you always want more than ever. Well we don't want to abide by your wishes, gun ownership is a recognized right, and your hatred of rights won't be tolerated. We're not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime, and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed.
1	That's incorrect. The Constitution begins with Article 1 which does not contain the Bill of Rights. The Constitution contains seven articles which are followed by the Bill of Rights and the rest of the amendments. If you really are from England as you claim then I guess your lack of knowledge about the American Constitution is understandable.
0	But if a loved one were murdered for simply protecting his/her family, what would life in prison do for justice? For you? For the low-life - but maybe get him paroled for some pacified, gutless reason/excuse?
1	Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.

They are lashing out in angst at the root of their behavioral conviction not at all giving heed to the millions of voters who are not particularly religious, or gay [yes - gay voters voted for it as well] who understand the over arching significance of having a lifestyle ordinance enforced by the state, its just wrong and will do significant harm to the country if not put down. It is flatly flys in the face of what defines morally clear legislation and reveals nothing more than a social agenda wanting to force its lawlessness on the public in general. They were reminded that they are survived by the grace of these who live and let live, and may find themselves on even a shorter social rope if they don't ease up on their madness being projected at people who have done nothing to them... ever.  It will ultimately backfire on them... best be assured of that.

1	I think bringing  emotions  into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.  Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to  non-belief  would be irrelevant (and irrational).
0	What if pigs had wings, they would make huge birds. But what do "what ifs" have to do with what really happened? The child didn't die and if it had, it wouldn't have been an abortion, it would have been between murder at the most, and negligent homicide, if not manslaughter, but not an abortion by any stretch of the law's interpretation since abortions are legal. And had the fetus died, the cops would have been charged with a crime. This is what's wrong with the premise of antonia's thread subject here, yet she couldn't discern that before posting this since she was intent on finding an avenue to attack pro-lifers with. And you are as irrational as she is for not seeing through her fallacious argument. After all, she can't even see how utterly hypocritical it is to blame pro-lifers for what occurred in this article while remaining oblivious to the carnage her pro-death ideology is responsible for to the tune of 1.4 million innocent children being killed each year in the USA alone.
1	An agnostic believes gods cannot be logically known (ie require faith). One can believe in the Christian god at the same time.
1	If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator.

1	Actually, the dating is done on layers above and below the rock in which fossils are found. You see, generally fossils are found in some sort of sedimentary rock. And sedimentary rock cannot be dated. But a layer of volcanic ash above and below the fossil can be dated and thus give a date within a range.

1	I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.

1	No, she misrepresented studies and took statistics out of context. Very right-wing. She asked how we would feel if we were killed. The fact that we have consciousness, awareness of ourselves(sentience) makes us different from the fetus during the level of development when the vast majority of abortions occur.
1	All of these examples are scientifically recognized as human life with a unique genetic code.
1	It is a widely known fact. A simple search on Google will turn up hundreds of articles, reports and so on.  Dr Michael Ackermann has a great deal of specific information (although he is Canadian, he research applies to the U.S. too)  http://www.dsgl.org/Articles/Ackermann.htm  He has a complete list of references and links to other sources on that page. A good one is here:  teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/Suter/med-lit.html  No. The point is that doctors are more dangerous than guns, highlighting the stupidity of the anti-gun crowed who believe that guns should be outlawed because they are &#8220;dangerous.&#8221;  Furthermore, if we wanted to include deliberate killing, we would have to include doctors who deliberately kill. And we would have to point out that many people who are killed with guns - should be killed (violent criminals, for example).  A few other education links are here:  http://www.aapsonline.org/press/medsentgun.htm  http://teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/...n/doctors.html  Yes. But guns are about more than safety.  A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.
1	Let me pose a hypothetical question.  Same scenario as yours above but instead there is a genetically normal zygote on one table or on the other table, there is a mentally retarded newborn baby...which one will you choose if you had 2 seconds to choose?  You see life is existant at both stages, at the single cell and the newborn baby, but our view (sometimes ignorance, sometimes selfishness) is why we choose what we choose.  So do tell me which one you will choose?
1	 Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?   I can't speak for everyone but they all have the capability to have an interest in living. A fetus simply doesn't.  Is there something you are trying to prove? Because I have seen this comparison a thousand times and have disproven it a thousand times over.

1	Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it.In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's "prenumbra" theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred:"Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: '[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.'"Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992)This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994). But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller? Give me a break . . .Who's sacrificing his principles for policy? At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens.Just for info sake, Harlan's dissent is also quoted in the plurality (Stevens concurring) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961)

1	If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.
1	No but the fact that infants have brain activity makes them a world of difference between a zygote that has no brain activity. They can think and feel and exhibit all the characteristics of other human beings. A zygote exhibits none of those characteristics.
1	Actually I pretty much agree with you here. Sex means possible pregnancy. If you don't want it there's condoms, birth control pills, and the morning-after pill. You shouldn't have sex without some sort of birth control if you don't want a kid, seems like common sense to me.
1	It doesn't seem to me that it is unconstitutional in nature if you are referring to the US constitution. It certainly doesn't violate the 8th amendment. To me the constitution question would be does the 1 gun per month violate the Massachusetts constitution's right to keep and bear arms. Now if there is a provision in the Massachusetts constitution against type of punishments than that changes the story.

1	Well some of ROCC's comments were addressing issues that lead to unplanned pregnancy. Sexual promiscuity does lead to pregnancy, an increased rate of sex will increase the rate of pregnancies, even when birth control is a factor. I do recognize that there are other problems involved with unplanned pregnancies and issues should be dealt with, though apparently the responsibility of creating solutions to these issues is given primarily to pro-life supporters. There are two main issues that have to be dealt with; reducing the amount of un-planned pregnancies, and giving more options to people who have an un-planned pregnancy. Now this may differ country to country depending on the social services that are available to support an unplanned pregnancy. Desperate action cannot justify making morally objective issues legal, and i say morally objective since I'm sure any sane person will agree that taking away the life of an innocent person is morally objective. Governments could make a lot of money on taxing narcotics to people who wish to take use in them, though this does not justify legalizing narcotics. Desperate drug addicts will be lead to desperate situations of theft in which they even may morally object to, but must partake in in order to feed their drug addiction. Even in the case of underground back-alley abortion clinics, they were just as safe as abortions are today, and haven't been any more dangerous since the invention of antibiotics and anesthetics. These procedures, though underground, were performed by qualified physicians who either believed that women should have the choice to kill their unborn child, or just realize that there was a small demand to do so. (The actual statistic on the demand that were presented in Roe vs. Wade were fabricated by the pro-choice community ten times the actual value)If you require me to prove or source any of this information, I would be glad to provide it.

If this is so random why don't 2-year old kids get lung cancer?  If everything was set by ID, then DNA would be unchangeable and therefore there would be no cancer  that's probably about the dumbest thing I've heard.....IDists have been promoting the concept of adaptive mutations for decades -- a concept darwinists detest. Contrary to your ignorant version, ID simply suggests that lifeforms don't change by way of happy accidents culled by selection -- as darwinists do.  Nobody care to answer me?: why would the cancer gene be selected?

1	Yes, the mythology has been around for a long time. Most cultures had their own. You have adopted the mythology of ancient Hebrews. You probably even somehow reconcile both stories of creation in your mind. But the technology and the techniques to use that technology didn't develop until about 400 years ago. Every since then we have used the idea that we can learn about our world by careful observation and experimentation. About 150 years ago, Darwin and Wallace recognized a mechanism for why living things change. About the same time, Mendel recognized how those changes were passed on to off spring. That the Biblical mythology of creation was false was actually demonstrated by men who believed in creation. They tried to reconcile their Bible with what was obviously true from the observations they made. But creationism has only been around since the early 20th century. It grew out of the anti-science movement of fundamentalism. It actually became popular in the 1960's.

1	Just because somebody calls it "therapy" doesn't mean it's about fixing a "disorder".People can have surgery to make themselves look prettier with fuller lips, bigger breasts, a tighter face. That doesn't mean having less full lips, small breasts, or an aged face is a "disorder".
1	It's interesting that you mention this because this was actually prophesied right from the beginning by God. Down through the centuries, women have been mistreated and often considered to be second-rate humans. This is because of imperfection, an imperfection that God could foresee:“Your craving will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.” (Genesis 3:16)Obviously men are not without blame too, but ultimately, due to disobedience to God, both Adam and Eve have had to pay the price and so have their offspring.

1	The bible is evidence. Its existence is a fact. What that fact represents is subject to interpretation. Ken's argument is that choosing to believe the bible is infallible is no more or less of a presupposition than choosing to believe that logic is infallible. He's right in absolute terms, but those axioms are not equally congruent with reality.
1	Walking-fish:  A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating. They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable. Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth, such as Robt Gentry's Polonium halos, rate of decay in the earth's magnetic field, rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth. This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates. Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries. So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands, hire a young earth creationist.

0	Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.

1	The death penalty does not work as a deterrent, not because of people's analysis of it, but because it simply does not work. It may in fact increase the rate of violent crime.FBI Report Reveals Murder Rate Rise in the SouthAccording to the FBI's Preliminary Uniform Crime Report for 2002, the murder rate in the South increased by 2.1% while the murder rate in the Northeast decreased by almost 5%. The South accounts for 82% of all executions since 1976; the Northeast accounts for less than 1%. Read the report. (FBI Preliminary Uniform Crime Report 2002, June 16, 2003).Four new studies on deterrence throw further doubt that there is any deterrent effect from sentencing people to death or executing people for homicide. The studies did find support for a brutalization effect. (RECAP Newsletter, National Death Penalty Developments, 12/99)Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)).Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of Oklahoma's Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (1998)).Effects of an Execution on Homicides in California. Author Ernie Thompson examined criminal homicides in Los Angeles before and after California's execution of Robert Harris in 1992, the state's first execution after a 25-year moratorium. Thompson found slight increases in homicides during the eight months following the execution. (3 Homicide Studies 129-150 (1999)).The Geography of Execution: The Capital Punishment Quagmire in America. Keith Harries and Derral Cheatwood studied differences in homicides and violent crime in 293 pairs of counties. Counties were matched in pairs based on geographic location, regional context, historical development, demographic and economic variables. The pairs shared a contiguous border, but differed on use of capital punishment. The authors found no support for a deterrent effect of capital punishment at the county level comparing matched counties inside and outside states with capital punishment, with and without a death row population, and with and without executions. The authors did find higher violent crime rates in death penalty counties. (Rowman and Littlefiled Publishers, Lanham, MD (1997))South Has Highest Murder Rate in 2001According to data released on October 28 as part of the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 2001, the South again has the highest murder rate of the four regions in the United States. The South was also the only region above the national average. In 2001, almost 80% of executions in the country occurred in the South. The report noted that the Texas crime rate rose 4% in 2001, nearly five times the national average, and the state posted a 7.6% increase in homicides. At the same time, the total number of executions in Texas is more than three times that of any other state in the nation. The Northeast, the region with the lowest murder rate, had no executions in 2001. (See DPIC's Execution Statistics, Crime in the United States, 2001, New York Times and Houston Chronicle, October 29, 2002) REGION MURDER RATE PER 100,000 PEOPLENortheast 4.2Midwest 5.3West 5.5South 6.7National 5.6- Crime in the United States, 2001Homicide Rates Fall in Canada After Abolition of Death PenaltyThe abolition of the death penalty in Canada in 1976 has not led to increased homicide rates. Statistics Canada reports that the number of homicides in Canada in 2001 (554) was 23% lower than the number of homicides in 1975 (721), the year before the death penalty was abolished. In addition, homicide rates in Canada are generally three times lower than homicide rates in the U.S., which uses the death penalty. For example, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the homicide rate in the U.S. in 1999 was 5.7 per 100,000 population and the rate in Canada was only 1.8. Canada currently sentences those convicted of murder to life sentences with parole eligibility. (Issues Direct.com, 8/4/02).

What do you suppose the primary reason for waiting until until the baby is crowning to abort? Seems odd to go thru 9 months and labor to change one's mind.  Why do suppose exaggeration and embellishment or an aversion to facts is necessary for some people who consider themselves pro life or at least anti choice?

1	Oh come on Steeeeve, around 50% of fertilized embroyo's will fail to implant anyway, so nature 'has killed/'is killing' half of all the people who have ever existed anyway. You cannot tell me that none of those are not just fluke losses of otherwise perfectly healthly embryos.Also, prevention of implantation is only one of several mechanisms by which emergency contraception works- it also prevents ovulation, disrupts passage of a released egg and inhibits fertilzation occuring in the first place.

Brady, this is just more cut and paste, this time largely from the website guninformation.org. For example, the statement

1	If that was not possible evolution would be impossible, it is direct evidence that evolution isn't impossible not that evolution exists. The same can be said for adaptation, natural selection, and mutation. They are all concepts that evolution stands on but their existance does not necessitate evolutions.For instance if I had the theory: when heavy ceramic objects fall on top of one another a very few super energetic particles fly outwards and cause leaves to fall.I could offer the fact that leaves and bricks do in fact fall, as "evidence" for my theory but it would not be in any way that the rising and setting of the sun was not evidence for both rotation and orbit.
1	The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts. Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level. What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world's water that comes with the increase in the oceans' mean temperature.  Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3' by 2100, so don't invest long-term in any beach-front property that isn't on tall stilts and you'll be OK.

1	But it does have an answer, as long as (and I see no reason to infer otherwise) 'organisation' is defined, as are many scientific concepts, as a human-imposed description of the sum of a multitude of physical cause/effect phenomena. Remember when we argued about entropy? I essentially stated (or admitted, if you want to see it that way) that the concepts that we label 'entropy', 'order', 'disorder' and even 'particle' are human-imposed abstracts applied for ease of understanding. Again referencing a point I have previously made, the maths that backs up the areas of physics (which necessarily includes chemistry/biology) that are confirmed with near-certitude, is equally as-certain-as-possible, but is impossible to satisfactorily translate into ordinary language; hence the terms employed that, relative to the maths, are so vague and easily misinterpretable. My best example is the uncertainty principle, which can be explained in words, but can only be shown to be an uncontrevertible fact by using maths. The great thing about the UP is that it is not even necessary to perform a real experiment; given certain parameters (already known) the UP is inevitable.The POV I am justifying here is one that does not even begin to reference such terms as 'organisation' and what may 'drive' it. This may be a personal thing, but ideally IMHO the scientific method should never assume 'organisation' or 'drives', it should only look at facts and figures. After this analysis has been done mathematically, there may (and indeed always are) patterns discernible that we, humans, can label 'organisation' and 'drives', but these things do not exist in and of themselves. They are abstracts, simplifications, words used so that we do not have to talk in complex equations.Given all this, when we come to the Four Fundamental Forces, we do actually know (ie we are almost certain) that these phenomena are a part of the world of facts and figures, not part of the world of human-imposed concepts. My best supporting argument for this is that the FFFs cannot (yet) be further reduced to anything simpler. There are plenty of other 'forces' such as kinetic energy, potential energy etc that derive their very existence from the FFFs. The FFFs are anything but non-material, as they are intermediated by known, defined, observed particles/quanta or in the case of gravity, the medium of spacetime. The only confusion comes when trying to determine "What is a particle? What is spacetime?" Regardless of the answers, surely we have to assume that particles and spacetime are material, for if not, then nothing is.
1	In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole "let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it" mentality....
1	How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?

You are pathetic.

1	And upon what grounds do you base this claim? Government chooses not to recognize different types of marriages all the time, not just same sex marriages ie. polygamist marriages, relatives, age limits, etc. These recognitions are not only federal but vary state to state, for instance some states recognize 1st cousin marriages while others don't, as I recall, the age of consent to marry also differs among states.
1	Armour piercing ammo, 100% legal. Here is where you can buy SS109 armour piercing ammo: http://ammoman.com/ I agree, the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items. You do not even have to buy them, you can make them yourself. I agree that the cops are not the best protection. The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF. Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened. Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent. If cops can get to a crime scene in time, they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions. In essence, they do not get the whole story, until it is over. You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first.For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken.I do not agree with people carrying firearms with no training. That is a very personal decision and I will not stop anyone from carrying a firearm if they choose to do so.
1	Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.

1	Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.  The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger,  dangerous knife  or razor  with intent to use the same unlawfully . Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.  Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against  undesirable  elements. Sponsor  Big Tim  Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train.

1	Yes. We all ask this question of creationists who propose that the universe was created out of nothing - poof! But science doesn't try to answer that question. We do know that the universe began expanding about 13.7 billion years ago. What went before that and the cause for the expansion isn't known and at present, and may never be knowable. However, we do know that particles can and do spring into existence from nothing, for no apparent reason. Google  Casimir effect  and read about one example. Wikipedia will probably be the 3rd entry. This something from nothing is an effect from the zero-point energy of a vacuum.

1	I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.  Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.  As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.  Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.  We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.
1	You are correct, but bear in mind it is just Bragg's introduction to the programme and not the opinion of the panel. This issue is explored in more detail when Dawkins talks about a population of self replicating molecules (27:00) and how the first life, as we define it would have arisen when there was concentration of these molecules and then the first cells- there is no suggestion of a single entity that was responsible for all subsequent life.  Thanks for the links on the articles btw.

1	Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has "found" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.Hank says:
1	I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us. (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to "represent" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)
0	While I don't appreciate your tone, you are correct in that I misunderstood the premise of this thread.The short answer is that I would have to be convinced that a soul exists and that a soul is injected at any point in the process of conception through labor. An unlikely situation given that I'm an agnostic.Though I have said that I'm amendable to banning 3'rd trimester abortions as a compromise. Loosely related to having my mind changed.
1	Well, the 40Ar/39Ar method was used to say that it was 65 mya.  This same method was used to date volcanic rock from the Mt. Vesuvius eruption to within 7 years.  But the KT boundary was dated using several radiometric methods that all agree to within a couple of million years.  Here is where I got that info:  http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rnc...12_30_1899.asp  Look at table 2.
1	Abortion targets a very specific group of human beings: unwanted, unborn children.  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.  The Convention defined genocide as any of a series of acts designed to  destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.  The acts listed include among others, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group or forcibly transferring children out of the group.
0	and she got punished for it  Good thing too because it led to the law being changed. If someone thought drunk driving was an unrighteous law and so they did it and got punished...I don't think you will see much sympathy. It many states that is probably true for abortion.  Why is it unrighteous anyway? Only because you disagree with it
1	Another unfounded assertion.
1	Try a google on cytochrome c.
1	Well I'm pretty sure if it was cyber-enhancements then that dog never would have been born for you to see. It would be in a lab somewhere. You are right that it is possible that this is the case, but over time you would have found out about it assuming the dog was born for you to see indicating there is no cover-up or secret made of it and you would learn all about it in the future. A year goes by, scientists say it was genuine evolution. Would that be enough evidence?
1	Not to be totally dependant and the systems of another body to keep it alive. Take a fetus out of the womb (That is during the period which most abortions are carried out) and it will die. Plus if the mother dies the fetus will as well. A baby doesn't depend on its mother's body to function. It can do that itself.
1	Yes you did, your very own god that fits what you wish to believe.It is not the God of Abraham,Issac and Jacob.He believed Moses was a real person and Genesis was history .Mat 8:4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. Mat 17:3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. Mat 17:4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. Mat 19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? Mat 19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. Mat 22:24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. Mat 23:2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seatMar 1:44 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. Mar 7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: Mar 9:4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. Mar 9:5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. Mar 10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him. Mar 10:3 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? Mar 10:4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. Mar 10:5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. Mar 12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? Yes the God of the Bible did not see Moses as a mythical science fiction writer as you do.Why do you consider yourself a Christian if you consider Jesus Christ a liar and a fool?You may notice I have not used the Old Testement at all here. You have to dismiss the entire Bible out of hand to believe in evolution.It is a conscious choice you make every day.
1	Really? How do you explain this picture? http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/images/hominids2.jpg I'm really interested.
1	we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other "ancient" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim "erosion" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called "Hidden Archeology" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the "wrong" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false.
1	Exactly, there is absolutely no evidence that biologists could show you that would make you think, "hey that would count of as transitional. Why? Because you have already accepted your previous convictions and closed your mind to anything new. How about doing what Porky Pine asked and giving us your definition of a transitional form?If you have spent any time at University, you should know that references older than 10 years shouldn't be used. Science has usually progressed sufficiently in this time, so that the information in the older articles/books, probably contains errors or invalid information.Scientists contradict each other all the time? It's the first step in finding correct answers. New hypotheses are proposed and tested, observations made etc and falsified ideas are discarded. It's what makes it work.
1	Yeah, because the Brady ratings and approval of a particular states gun laws has no bearing on reality as far as crime and safety goes! Which is Nato's real point!
0	Just wondering if you are going to respond to the OP (as it was addressed to you to help you to understand something).  If you ask me I'd just ignore the negative comments that some posters make toward you. Just focus onexplanations of misunderstandings and constructive criticism.
0	Actually I pretty much agree with you here. Sex means possible pregnancy. If you don't want it there's condoms, birth control pills, and the morning-after pill. You shouldn't have sex without some sort of birth control if you don't want a kid, seems like common sense to me.
0	What if a 13 year old girl comes up to you and asks for sex, and you agree? Are you forcing yourself on to her?
1	Then I'd like to see your definition of the scientific method. As I recall, the scientific method is purely secular.  What evidence of God? Please, show me such evidence. There is no evidence of God. God is of the supernatural, you cannot prove the supernatural with evidence from the natural! God cannot be proven, nor can it be disproven. There is no evidence of God, and there is no evidence that there is no unorthodox God.
1	Just a technical point. Evolutionary theory does not require that mutations should be random. Molecular geneticists are well aware that some genes in some organisms mutate more often than others; alternatively, some genes are conserved more strongly than others. It's just that hotspots apart, there is no evidence for result-orientated directed mutation of genes. Within certain constraints, they appear to be random, but evolutionary theory as such doesn't demand that they should be.Second, natural selection through competition for resources isn't the only force constraining evolution (though it is the major explanation of adaptation). There is also genetic drift which can distribute neutral mutations through populations, and there are probably also other factors such as structural constraints and canalisation affecting which mutations can see the light of day (i.e. get exposed to natural selection) and which will not.
1	yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves.
1	[quote=Nu Leader]To Dzeron:  * The fact that we do not have any undisputed transitional fossils. More information about this and some other fossils that show that they must have been formed catastrophically during Noah's Flood can be found by clicking on this link.  * The fact that the second law of thermodynamics denies molecules to man evolution; more can be found out on the following site:  http://www.christiananswers.net/q-ed...odynamics.html  QUOTE]  Don't have time to refute everything from the pratt list, but I picked these two, and others can do the rest.  1) We have tons of undisputed transitional fossils. Try here...  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html and here...  http://www.geo.ucalgary.ca/~macrae/talk_origins.html  The problem isn't that there aren't any transitional fossils, the problem is that creationists refuse to accept any of them as transitional.  Example. Take a color chart that has all the colors between blue and yellow. What creationists do is draw a line halfway between the two and then claim that everything on one side is blue, and everything on the other side is yellow. They ignore the fact that there are many shades in between.  Regarding the 2nd law of thermodynamics, the claim would only make sense in a closed system. Earth isn't a closed system because of the heat we receive from the sun, and the suns entropy increases. Think of it this way. If the sun were to suddenly wink out then the temperature on earth would quickly become absolute zero (-459 degrees F) and all life on earth would cease. Make sense?  Bob Riggins wrote a wonderful essay on this subject a while back. It's here...  http://members.aol.com/darrwin/thermo.htm
0	Does this mean that I can use the terms "fetus" and "baby" interchangeably? Like can I say, "I need to find a fetus sitter so I can go out to the movies with my friends."When I go car seat shopping, can I ask for "a seat to put my fetus in?"Or when I'm in a child's clothing store, can I ask for fetus clothes?
1	I think you've made a bit of a sweeping generalization here. I haven't heard of many people opposing sex altogether. I have heard of people who oppose both sex before marriage and sex outside of marriage.
0	Excerpt from the study  What the Hell kind of study is this? They take random shooting cases and determined that 6% had a weapon nearby. Did they check to see if the person had that weapon legally? Were they drug dealers shot during a turf war? Were they criminals shot by other criminals?  And then they randomly call up Philly residents and ask them if they have guns in their house?  The $hit that is passed off as science nowadays scares the Hell out of me!
1	How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time, as recorded by fossils?
0	That ad is a flat out distortion of Palin's view.  Her view is that the state governments should decide how to regulate abortions. The consequence of that view is that the state governments would be free to allow abortion, or prohibit abortion, on whatever basis and to whatever degree they wanted.
0	The problem here is that Christians (such as I am) consider the Bible to be Proof.
1	Diversionary tactic. The point is that it's harder to kill with the other weapons mentioned.
0	Even Joe the plumber abandoned the garbage scow? Say it aint so!
0	I am afraid easy rider I don't think you met the standard of the challenge. It is a non-sequitur to say that something is bad because the people who support it are confrontational.
1	You mean where the judge did the job she's paid to do by ruling on the constitutionality of a law? Or is this only a problem when it's laws that you like that are ruled unconstitutional?This is Civics 101. If the legislature writes a law that is unconstitutional, it's the job of the judicial branch to strike it down. The legislature can then rewrite the law, or get the constitution amended. I've yet to see you demonstrate this process being abused in the matter of gay marriage. All you've done is point out rulings you don't like.
1	Following your link, Ive just been  visiting  the website of  Doctor  Hovind and his associates: I found it a lot of fun - a sort of Disneyland of  creationist science .  Of course the good  doctor  takes advantage of almost universal ignorance about the scientific foundations of evolution: this is a melancholy fact, and it takes the edge off the laughs I had.
1	Not wanting to appear insensitive, but XXX is she doing having a 4th child if she can't even support the first 3? I don't buy a 4th car if I can't afford the upkeep, why should children be different?  It's the entitlement mentality that caused our current problems with illegitimacy and keep the poor chronically poor. She doesn't need an abortion, she needed birth control/sterilization prior to becoming pregnant.
0	So then you're alright with an organization that actively hung people from trees and committed murder for the sake of intimidating those that wanted to be able to vote, ride up front on buses, have decent facilities, etc.Nice to know where you stand. White supremacists support gun control.
1	Try going to a concert, party, club, and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke....doubtful (unless it is second hand) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not. The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that doesn't mean every pot head will go to crack. HBO had a good special about this some time back.
1	Really, what is the materialistinc approach to which you refer (assuming you're also talking about 'pain')?  a) Is it strictly materialistic, or do they use non-material methods as well?  b) Can it be used to onbjectively measure pain?
0	But then you are as your post indicates.
1	Smoking indeed. High carb diets probably not - high fat yes esp colon cancer {so we think}, low-nutirition does not mean much so I wont respond, as I said some environmental mutagens man-made and otherwise, mental health? I don't know of any direct link to cancer for that. Environmental  toxins  are often carcinogenic because they induce mutations for most practical purposes random ones. Smoking is much the same. And many cancers are literally the result of bad luck - a passing cosmic ray for example. I would also add that many cancers also require more than a single mutation and two hits or more are required to produce the disease. Epigentic effects are of course another form of mutation.
1	So 43% + 12% = 55% that oppose new laws in the Gallop.
1	But wouldn't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves? That is, does one have to believe that the two specimens (which share biochemical similarities) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient (and more scientific?).
1	Try a new experience. Check these names from that list; David Catchpoole, Emil Silvestru, Gary Parker, and Carl Wieland. I found them quickly - there are probably others like them who were once atheists, who became scientists, and subsequently creationists.
0	Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult. Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature.
1	There's no such thing as the  Liberal Party .
0	You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was "the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue.
0	And that's what scientists will do. No change there, then.  Now, on the subject of long-held religious views, how many so-called Christians will have a rethink when presented with new findings?
1	And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
1	You presume correctly, sir. :) Overall the USSR could produce almost the same level of technology the US could during the cold war; however the restrictive nature of Soviet society during that time I believe quashed the possibility of many bright Soviet citizens to be better educated, and eliminated the possibility that many of them could reach their potential. I hope the situation is improving there; guess we'll find out in 50 years.Another factor that contributed was the fact that there are more remote and undeveloped areas in the former USSR than in the US, which supports the idea that parts of the Soviet Union were (and may still be) less developed.
1	How do we get a tree to stand upright long enough for it to petrify, and how do we get upright petrified trees in layers of strata.There is evidence all over the world that stands up for biblical events, all you need to do is open yourself up and have a look..I urge you guys to get a hold of the movie "The search for the real Mt Sianai". This movie is rivetted with evidence for the Moses account in the bible. Any person with there head screwed on right will not be able to deny it!
0	Ahh... There you have it. Restrict ammo, not guns. Would be a far more succesful way of enforcing gun-control.
1	But there is no evidence that it did not come about by natural processes. And, there is, in fact, evidence of natural processes that may have resulted in life. Just because you don't understand it doesn't make it so.
0	Really? I don't see myself in trouble for saying them. I stand by them, for they are truthful words.
1	I believe the question was aimed at those who advocate only the police being armed and nobody else, the ones who believe that only the police have good reason for having access to guns, but no regular person needs a gun for any reason whatsoever.
1	“When the pro-life movement began in the early 70's, being pro-life meant you were 100% opposed to any and all abortion. In the early 80's, that standard was watered down to include those who had rape, incest, and the life of the mother exceptions. Now in the 90's, things have declined so rapidly that someone who is only opposed to partial-birth abortions can sell themselves as pro-life."- Pastor Matt Trewhella How does that crow taste?
0	Ok. I'm not a YEC. So, God creation through science is a viable option for my faith.
1	NO! the dealth penalty does nothing to help society! killing a person, no matter the reason, is still murder. y should that be justified? By killing a person who murdered someone, you are just doing the same thing you are punishing him/her for. plus, what if u were wrong? and u put an innocent person to death??
1	Using dembski's definition, it would seem information is derived from complexity, complexity being defined by the mathematics used to describe it.
0	Well I'm neither rational nor a theist, but still!I could put in a comment about what I personally believe the nature of God to be, but I'm sure you've all heard it before so I won't bother!In the end I don't think it is an easy question to answer, it is asking to define the undefinable. Humans are limited creatures, we can give a dictionary definition of these things, we have a rough idea of the concept of infinity but can never begin to truly comprehend or define it.
0	These things are being taught in schools every day. Maybe the problem is that they're not being reinforced at home. One's role modeling starts with family.
0	If you feed me a lot of caffinated coffee i start to wiggle and squirm too. I'm not really in any pain.
1	The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.
1	I have to agree with Jo Bennett here Fracas, you're simply injecting your personal opinion about morality into a conversation on statistics. One has nothing to do with the other. Muddying the Waters is a tactic all too easily realized. Oh, and about your previous responce to my question. I would behouve you to pay attention to whom is doing the posting to understand their intent and bias.
1	i've no problems with gay couples marrying if they have kids straight couples can adopt as well
0	Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin. There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see. Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not!!!! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point. Guess not though.
1	Pregnancy isn't expensive at all unless you're conned into thinking it has to be. If it were, poor people couldn't have the kids they do. Medical costs can be paid for by others. It's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly.  In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption, there is NO cost incurred to the mother.
1	There are certainly other theories, but the big bang is the only one supported by the evidence.
0	And yet you  and other women  feel free to impose their version of reality on innocent lives.
1	You're kidding, right? Telescopes, microscopes, radio telescopes. Surely you've heard of these. And we even have devices called spectometers which let us see what wavelengths make up a sample of light. There are some sample pics of their output here:  http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cch.../hspectra.html
1	Given that this is the gun control forum, it seems logical to focus on gun control rather than other factors relevant to the crime rate. This is just a slimy attempt by you to misrepresent my position.
1	Actually, natural selection is one of the mechanisms of evolution. There is more to it than that, but creationists with limited knowledge can't figure that out.
1	I know a number of Christians who do actually stick to this belief.  And this one too (abeit watered down- having to wear a to church)  Goes to show just when you thought we had gone all progressive there are some people wanting hiding blatant sexism behind the veil of religion.  But with regard to your point I agree entirely- the bible is interpreted in different ways, depending on the person.
1	Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.
0	Yes Joe, please quit trying to impose your way of life on us. The majority of americans are against this sort of behavior, yet you continue to try to impose this aberrant behavior on the rest of society. We dont want any part of it.
0	You are right, there are Republicans that are moderates and favor abortion.......There are Democrats that are Conservative and are anti abortion......There are just many more Republicans that are Conservative then there are Democrats who are........  That is why although I am a Conservative I usually vote Republican..............
1	Well, j, the blah blah blah part was pretty important.It said, "Seife is referring to how information continues to exist in some form after it has been violently altered; the smoke from a burning newspaper contains data about the newspaper's content, albeit impossible to reconstruct, and even black holes seem not to truly eradicate the information in the matter they consume. All of which has nothing to do with Dembski's claim..." which is true. One definition has nothing to do with the other. Blah blah blah.http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/903

1	Yes, some do, They are known as 'Young Earth Creationists" .   Check out http://www.icr.org/
0	Is it productive an exericee to make such generalisations which are in effect a product of a priori notions that anyone who is religious is irrational anyway?
1	And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.
0	Because evolution is how God created. Sorry, but we can't lie to our kids. We can't tell them creationism is true when God tells us it is false.
1	Well there's a new Covenant / Testament. But Jesus declared all foods clean so you can have your pork. Check for trichinellas, which is probably one reason it wasn't on God's preferred list in those unsanitary times.Recommended study for you: Investigate the different kinds of laws (i.e. moral, civil / tort, ceremonial, dietary). Then look at how these issues are treated in the NT.
1	Ten Commandments.   Used as basic social norms.

1	Well, actually if the remainder is split between those who favor a marriage amendement and those who have no oppinion, yeah, actually 52% regardless of the margin of error, is still definitatively a majority.
0	well, it is irrational if you believe that human life is a good thing. Some people tend to think that it is ok to degrade people because it 1) makes economic sense 2) cuts down on the population 3) makes THEIR life easier. However, when you degrade people you make society worse off...so I really don't see a point. Nice to see you here by the way.
1	the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years. And what's so funny about it is I'm sure none of these articles make mention of this being a huge controversy and how it gives ammunition to creationsits: they just play like dissent doesn't exist.  How does protein last 68 million years? Anyone who believes this is out of their mind.
0	I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The "you believe in evolution" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that.
1	A democracy is simply a form of government where ordinary dirtbags like us have some say in the matter. You've actually helped me with this, as in North Korea, Cuba, and the USSR under Stalin, your opinions certainly don't matter to them.
1	Actually, we have museums full of evidence. Only a fool talks about scientific proof. On the other hand, we wouldn't need any box for the evidence of creation or ID that you think is OK to teach as science. It doesn't exist.
1	That's virtually the point of the first post, steeeeve. The soul, or any other superstitious beliefs, have nothing to do with a logical debate about abortion. But surely you'd agree that many people who post about abortion introduce the  soul  concept. I wouldn't call the thread worthless as it's challenging supernatural beliefs people bring up in discussing abortion.
1	You're saying that if we track the causes of these diseases back to their source its sugar. You are then saying that modern humans have adapted to a high sugar diet by having smaller skulls, because if you eat a very sugar rich diet over a prolonged period of time you will suffer from degenerative diseases that cause the brain to shrink. The next generation responds to their parents degenerative disease by being born with a smaller skull?
1	How do you know this and why would this be a detriment to the species?
1	an image is not the original. a photo of you is not you, its an image of you. the image cannot be or replace the original, and isnt intended to  regardless of how  perfect  the photocopier is, you cannot cash the  perfect  copy of the check. it may be a perfect replica, to the detail, but it is still only an image. the problem isnt the quality of the copying process, but the fact that the copy itself is just that, a copy, not the original
1	Well try Arkansas (75/25), Georgia (76/24), Kentucky (75/25), Michigan (59/41), Mississippi (86/14), Montana (67/33), North Dakota (73/27), Ohio (62/38), Oklahoma (76/24), Oregon (57/43), and Utah (66/34).All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the "religious right" feel the same way.
0	Well, I guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. It's up to you.
1	Just for those who also don't know better. Not all who oppose abortion do so from a  pro-life  stance. Nor do we all come from a religious stance.  Atheist and Agnostic Pro-Life League
0	But the fact is, that son of God Jesus was a lier and that Bible was just a story book but we are all fool to deify them !
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.
0	No, instead you perfectly demonstrated your lack of comprehension.
1	Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.

1	You don't need an FFL to transfer an out of state  antique  firearm. I believe it is also OK for a minor to purchase and own an antique firearm. In addition, I believe the NFA doesn't apply to antique firearms. (Am I correct on that last one?)  So, zachvac can mail order a double barreled shotgun, saw the barrels short, and attach a pistol grip, legally.
0	Really, so California is just a peachy crime free place because of its strict firearms laws? What about New York? But wait! Don't forget good ol Washington DC! Their crime rate is lower than Bush's approval rating because of their strict firearm laws!  Of course they are going to have a higher rate of firearms death, but they're obviously going to have a lower rate of everything else (criminal related) death. In the end, Its lower.
0	Why on earth would a woman come out now, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago, when it was illegal, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about?  Why on earth would any woman do that?  When did official medical records become non trustworthy? The conspiracy theories and blinders that both sides are wearing are astounding.  Waxy  P.S. I think the whole thing is repugnant, and any real politicizing of it by the Democrats would be disgusting IMHO. However, Bush did open the door with his strong anti-abortion stance, and sometimes, when you make your bed....
0	Very sad news. I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.
1	Misleading: having complex eyes in trilobites in no way contradicts evolution.   1) Evolution holds that primitive eyespots predated the Cambrian explosion (probably in a small, simple worm of some sort ... and 'worm tracks' have been found in pre-Cambr
1	Walking-fish:  A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating. They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable. Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth, such as Robt Gentry's Polonium halos, rate of decay in the earth's magnetic field, rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth. This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates. Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries. So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands, hire a young earth creationist.

Should you thank your government overlords to allow you to protect your family with a shotgun as opposed to a FLASH SUPPRESSED carbine?

0	For those that argue over the pretense of  marriage is a religious institution , I don't know why they don't push SOLELY for what governmental involvement of  civil unions .  After all, if the government has a hand in the institution of marriage, it's not just a  religious institution .  Moreover, those fighting against gay marriage are doing so SOLELY in the governmental arena. If a gay couple gets married in their church, that's entirely legal in 50 states with no attempts to make it illegal.  So it kind of undermines the pretense of  religious  concerns when people SOLELY try to prevent GOVERNMENTAL recognition of gay unions.

And I've never heard of him being a vegetarian.  I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite, but I don't think they mentioned his being a veggie.  I don't see how being a tetotaller and a vegetarian are good characteristics.
1	Because you've presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals.  If you can't prove it's broken, you don't have grounds to call for fixing it.
1	You are correct. Fighting crime has never been the idea behind registration. Its more like some left-tard politico urinating on your leg and telling you its raining.  Well so far the courts have gone with protecting the felons. I don't believe the biased left mainstream media will be covering it in a favorable light either. Our only hope is the blogsphere and talk radio. But the left is after them in a big way. They can't bring back the  fairness doctrine  so now its the magic word diversity. As in diversity of ownership. When are we the people going to kick that garbage to the curb? What ever happened to equal protection under that law. Now its conservatives need not apply.
0	Yes he is telling me:  "This is what I am doing to my dog, and what I have been up to all this time as your president."
1	Thanks!  There's a petrified forest in Mississippi also. I don't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces, but I'll find out next trip.  I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?  Likely, the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen. Other inert gases could have done the same.
0	Just laugh ok, it's my first attempt at making up a joke lol  I guess it would only be funny for an anti-evolutionist, not like yourself.  A bit like trying to make a hillbilly laugh at the red-neck jokes or make an Irish man laugh at three men jokes (Enlishman, Scotsman and Irishman).
1	Oh good grief!  I have always lived in rough areas. In one city, Alburquerque, a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept, and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun.  Where I worked, less than a block away, a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place.  I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER, I didn't know the stupid beast, I was scared to death, but I felt it my Christian duty (even though I am not a Christian) to get the guy to where he could get treatment.  And I don't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted.
1	So you define religion as the following:  1) Testable  2) Based on Experiments  3) Based on empirical evidence  4) Open to change based on experiments and new evidence  5) Validity based on facts, rather then Faith  If evolution is a religion, so is Chemistry.
0	Is it only religious people who insite violence and hatred toward gays? NO!  You're attempting, weakly at that, to jump on the Frist-train by saying hes persecuting religious people. As if religious people are being singled out.
0	And yes, I have seen the signs for help centers, and I think that is a good thing... there should be organizations like that, to show women that there ARE other choices for them so that they don't think that their only option is abortion. But I still feel that they should have the right to decide what they want to do... but not just women.. if the father in question is involved, I think they should be a part of that decision too...
0	Yes, it would be a huge leap for law enforcement to jail someone for having a child. Not sure if it would send the messege the judge wanted or further polarized people.  I agree with what he was trying to do, but you're right that this is something that should not be enforced.  If this becomes a precedent, private lives are pretty much out the door. Might be a bit alarmist, but this makes me think that legislated sex is next.
1	Like, how many shooting in Germany?  Like, what's the ratio of shootings to population in the two nations of Germany and the U.S?
1	Because of the rare nature of fossilisation, we don't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years. I really don't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions, because of the nature of fossilisation.Science is like a detective story. If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.3 questions for Calligirl.For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time?I really don't think this will progress if you can't tell us what it is you would like to see.
0	What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.
1	So there it is in black and white! That LEO knew or should have know he was a legitimate ccw carrier but no matter as anyone in Texas can carry a gun in their car if they are not a gang member or convicted felon. Wrong is wrong, can you say  wrong  slick?
1	Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I won't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well. Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality.The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion "I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else" or "I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else". Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion. Either way, you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality.
1	So then you will agree that evolution is useless in getting at possible answers on what really matters, how we got here? If you concede that then I'm happy to end this discussion. I recall, however, visiting the Smithsonian and seeing a detailed description of how amino acids combined to form the building blocks of life. Evolutionary theory does address origins and its explanations are unsuppported by evidence. politicalref.com
0	Ok, so you are admitting that the unborn fetus, is in fact, a child? I have to believe that is what you mean from your statement above. That being the case, do you condone the killing of a child that is born but will likely live in poverty the rest of his or her life? Do you condone the killing of a handicapped child that is born? If not, then you can't condone abortion. Also, who gives you the right to decide what is best for a child by killing him or her? That should not be your choice (this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air). I am sure the child wouldn't agree to that choice if given a voice to do so. Let's go ahead and do it your way by taking religion out of law. Is murder still illegal in your humanistic world? Likely it is still illegal because even humanists realize that anarchy is not suitable for society. Then why is this not murder? Look back to effects this has on women. That is also bad for society. And that affects us all.
1	So you only class an abortion as something that occurs 8 weeks after conception?That's your line to draw. However, I doubt you could persuade many courts that 'looking like a human' was a valid qualifier for being a person.Everyone draws the line somewhere - be it conception, birth, or some point in between the two (if not before or after, in some cases). That doesn't mean that their version of 'the line' should automatically be the legal one. At the moment (in the UK, at least), that line is legally drawn at the point when the baby becomes viable; that is, when it could potentially survive a premature birth. Before that point, everyone can choose their own qualifiers.You can argue that the line should be legally redrawn... but I doubt 'looking like a human' will be considered the strongest of arguments.
0	Now you're claiming that a gun is a precision machine. Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as  assault weapons  are  inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip . Which is it?  Prove it then.  Then you've got absolutely no justification for supporting gun control, you should be supporting criminal control instead.  Then why do you keep supporting laws that would restrict access to guns, rather than making it harder for violent offenders to get out of prison and back on the streets where they pose the greatest danger?  Then what's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms? Do you fear something in particular? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better?
0	No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is.
1	Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.
0	Relevance?  Care to tell me how many inorganic reactions occur every second in every cubic meter of soil on this planet?  or are you going to be the typical creationist and always change the subject?  I'd still like an answer as to how your post is relevant to Darn Republican's asinine assertions. But you won't. Because you're a creationist.
1	When it's obviously a law that's not unconstitutional, then it's obvious the judge was biased in the ruling. A strict constitutionalist would never overturn a law like that, as the constitution does not define marriage.
1	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation. 
0	And how do we know that she would have wanted it. What if the Petersons got into a fight because Laci found out Scott had been cheating on her and that was the reason why he killed her? What if they would otherwise have gotten a divorce and then she would have gotten an abortion because she no longer wanted the baby?
1	Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population.
0	Everything basically.  You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. They decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life.
1	I was unaware that chocked full and non-existant were synonomous,learn something new everyday.I agree , who would believe in dino to birds after reading this , an idiot? Wrong answer , an evolutionist would. I guess those are synonyms as well.Just so you can't say I took it out of context here is Dr. Olsen's letter in it's entirety.National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington, D. C. 20560 1 November 1999 OPEN LETTER TO: Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary PRaven@nas.org Committee for Research and Exploration National Geographic Society Washington, DC 20036 Dear Peter, I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society. With the publication of "Feathers for T. rex?" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature. Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas "will later name" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so. Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen "accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon," the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters. Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that "the Czerkases now plan to return it to China." In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation. There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband. Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions. Prior to the publication of the article "Dinosaurs Take Wing" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that "makes" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that "we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned. More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that "hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical. The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction. The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode. Sincerely, Storrs L. Olson Curator of Birds National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington, DC 20560 Ph. 202-357-33212 FAX 1-202-633-8084 email: olson.storrs@nmnh.si.edu Why don't you write Dr. Olson and ask him if this is true ?

0	Today I was driving my son and two of his team-mates to basketball practice. One of the kids used the word gay in a derogatory manner. I asked him not to. My son said "ya, my dad is gay." No teasing, no name calling, a few curious a questions and back to basketball.My son has also been thrown to floor of the bus and force fed garbage for asking a kid to not use the word "gay" in a derogatory manner.Do you really think the solution is to prevent gay people from forming families so mean kids can have free reign to be little asses? Or maybe the fact that a kid has gay parents isn't the real issue.I would also like to point out that your argument fails to address the thousands of gay parents who have BIOLOGICAL children.

If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government.
1	would this be considered intelligent design? to me it would be like winding up a top, loading it with paint, and then letting it spin on paper to create a painting. the process is deliberately set in motion, but the painting itself is random and not deliberate. where the paint falls is not by design, even though the overall pattern would be.anyway, to answer the question, there are lots of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution, so the beliefs are not mutually exclusive. the problem is that christianity depends upon the account of genesis being true. spontaneous origin is mutually exclusive to genesis, but evolution by itself is not necessarily. but evolution poses other problems such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaurs that creationists are stumped by.in order to belief in evolution, you must, at the very least, disregard the genesis account. and disregarding genesis automatically invalidates christianity. but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator. pretty wierd, huh?
1	The attacker is usually armed in spite of gun control laws. All they do is disarm the law abiding. Not to mention the lack of enforcement on criminals.
1	I believe Jesus actually can be both. Jesus called himself "the son of man", and we all fall into that category. Jesus calmed his father was in heaven. Jesus asked his mother, "Who is my brother or my sister?" How can Jesus be the son of man and yet the son of God? What prayer did Jesus give when asked?Jesus told those who asked for a prayer from him to pray; "Our Father, who art in heaven." Hold up- If we pray, "our father", then who are we?We are the son of man. We are the son of God. Maybe getting to know yourself brings you closer to God than anyone else can. What does being born again mean? All things born have a mother and a father. I believe love is logical. And Love is the simple key to understanding yourself and your neighbor. No other key will get you closer to self understanding. Now its logical to say a designer places a little of himself in everything he makes. If this is true then God is in us. Maybe love and a mirror is the best book you'll ever read on the subject of God.
1	Well I think that god must be a bit confused since he also says....“Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.” – Numbers 31:17-18He doesn't seem to mind at least some retroactive abortions....
1	Actually it is the creationists who don't know what they are talking about. If they wish to talk about cosmology, then by all means talk about it. Just don't pretend that anything discusses has any bearing on evolutionary theory.
1	Yes. www.talkorgins.org
1	Actually, if you want to check, you will find that biologists themselves will point out the holes. We still have a lot to learn. Many of the holes have been closed even in my lifetime and the creationist god-of-the-gaps is being reduced to smaller and smaller gaps. But if you want a creationist to "join the real world", you're going to have to do more than be offensive and insulting. You might present some actual facts to support your position. Of course, I presume that you will actually educate yourself before presenting the facts.Have a nice day.
1	Hey thanks for the "edited/out of context sermon." Peter was rebuked for interfering with the plans of God. Oh . . . Christ never said to throw the sword away. . . "put it away" means put it away in the sheath.Mark 8: 31 And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again. 32 And He spoke the word openly. And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him. 33 But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan, because you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men. 34 And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take his cross, and let him follow Me. 35 For whoever desires to save his life, he shall lose it. But whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel, that one shall save it. 36 For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, yet damage his soul? 37 Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul? 38 For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father, along with the holy angels.Matt 26: 47 And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him was a numerous crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 And the one betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss, it is He; seize Him. 49 And coming up at once to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi. And he ardently kissed Him. 50 But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then coming up, they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. 51 And, behold, one of those with Jesus, stretching out the hand, drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword shall perish by a sword. 53 Or do you think that I am not able now to call on My Father, and He will place beside Me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?

1	Didn't we supposedly evolve from apes? Why would it be so impossible to conceive the idea they could have evolved into a different species of human.
0	Funny. It is you who have "abso-freaking-lutely" no qualms about forcing gays and lesbians to pony up dough for Mr and Mrs. John Q Taxpayers marriage and divorce, all the whie denying them the chance to follow the same course as Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer. You my friend are a complete hypocrite. Either give them marriage or quite taxing them to help yours.On another topic, I find it sad that you were ever given the position of moderator with your hateful and dishonest posts like this one. Very glad that it was stripped from you.
0	And you're a poor replacement for that koolaid-drinking Seer Travis.

0	But maybe god does not hate gays, maybe he just hates the ones that demand to have sex with people whether they want it or not.
1	Evolutionists do not argue about light-years as it is not a part of evolution.I don’t know how the theories that Einstein developed could be used to show that a light-year is variable.None of this has any effect on the vast amount of physical evidence that the earth is around 4.5 billion years old.
0	It's called an analogy. The article claimed that the relationship between homosexuals and discrimination and between gun owners and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of "who they are." Thus, I extended this analogy so that the relationship between gun owners and discrimination and between serial racists and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of "who they are." The analogy that I made was not comparing gun owners to serial rapists, but rather, it was comparing the relationship of the two groups with discrimination.And what is your deal with lunatic fringe leftie? Antigun laws are clearly not a fringe view, or gun control laws would not have been passed in Congress. You can hardly call the views lunatic. I doubt any doctor would agree that a person with liberal views regarding gun control is mentally insane.My anti-freedom agenda? What the hell are you talking about? Are you an anarchist? That's the only way to have 100% freedom. The fact that government exists means that there are restrictions. So unless you are an anarchist, I can call you anti-freedom as much as you call me anti-freedom. The question is the degree to which government should restrict freedoms, and that is not an obvious question to answer.Can you please explain how my views on gun control reveal that I'm racist. Have I proposed a law which would restrict gun usage for only a certain race?
1	Humm. More guns, more Concealed Carry and Violent Crime and Murder is down to it's lowest levels since they started to record it. So how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct. emoticon_rolleyes
0	I'm sorry, but your entire rant is nothing but ignorance based fear mongering. From YOUR ARTICLE:
0	Daily Herald | Mayor Daley lays out strict gun rules for Chicago  That particular rule, wouldn't that mean anybody who lives in Chicago and buys a handgun, wouldn't legally be able to take the gun from the shop to their home, because that would mean having it out on city streets, which is illegal?  Didn't Ohio or some city there try just that move a while back?
1	well then back up your claim. Saying "I'm sure that..." doesn't make it true.
1	...and if RMNS doesn't explain the development of hands or feet, it's pretty safe to say it doesn't explain the development of anything else, either.
1	No, I know this to be true. As shown, over and over.
1	I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God. If a person does not beleive in God, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality.
0	Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman.

1	Then you concede that EAM is not scientific, since its premise is philosophical.
1	That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.
1	Cite your source, preferably online, so that it can be found easily. Of course, this is like you asking for an example of tests done on animals (I assume that you mean vertebrates). Mutations can be harmful and often are, except when a selective pressure is exerted. In those cases, some mutations become helpful, and those reproduce. Please research your claims.
1	I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yet
0	It was a pretty clear rebuttle of the idea that the ToE breeds social elitism, Marxism, and Nazisim.I guess you're right though, SS. This wasn't nearly as entertaining as a slough of out-of-context quotes to show that ToE-accepting biologists reject the ToE.
0	I think there are some things they will habitually avoid discussing. After a while, even Archie realizes the claims he makes that are no-brainer false.
1	Okay.The best succinct representation of the scientific method is probably circular:We make an observation about what we see.We form a hypothesis based on our observation.We perform an experiment to test the hypothesis.We make an observation about what we see (in the experiment).Rinse and repeat...Now add a spur: after repeated refinement and confirmation of hypotheses, a theory is devised.
0	Why on earth would a woman come out now, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago, when it was illegal, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about?  Why on earth would any woman do that?  When did official medical records become non trustworthy? The conspiracy theories and blinders that both sides are wearing are astounding.  Waxy  P.S. I think the whole thing is repugnant, and any real politicizing of it by the Democrats would be disgusting IMHO. However, Bush did open the door with his strong anti-abortion stance, and sometimes, when you make your bed....
1	So creationism denies what God says in Genesis 1. That's a fact. I'm a Christian, so for you, that's strike 1.
0	You think its bad now? Watch what happens if Gov't takes control. I saw a great tagline the other day, it said  If the US get socialized medicine where will Canadians get healthcare?   Anyone who doesn't like insurance premiums is free not to pay them, at least until the gov't takes over.  Happy New Year
0	Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.  You said you vowed to rob people and fight the government, and said that you have no problem with a women ending up broke and on the street. You've not really been all that nice yourself
1	Well you should protect yourself of course, that is your right (and duty) as a human being, but that's not what the 2nd amendment is for. It's just convenient that the tools that protect you from tyranny can also be used to protect yourself against criminals.
1	And yet, here his drawings are used, as plain as day in a 2002 text book to teach evolution. You can choose to just ignore evidence you don't like lesz, but that doesn't make it go away. Evolution News &amp; Views: The Textbooks Don?t Lie: Haeckel?s Faked Drawings Have Been Used to Promote Evolution: Raven &amp; Johnson (2002) (Part 2)  When will you people learn that since Talk Origins exists to defend the fraudulent pseudo science of evolution, it stands to reason that all it does is perpetuate lies and misinformation!
0	Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).
0	Why should I call myself that since everyone on the planet is as well?
0	Yes, it is. I'm actually considering moving out of the south specifically for that reason. I will miss the largemouth bass fishing....wth is a pike? It's always been that bad though, now that I think about it. It's just I ignored it more when I was younger.  The sticker is moronic IMO. If they label  evolution  with that, they should go ahead and label every single book, TV, everyone's forehead, and every object that can hold a sticker in the entire world. Some people thing there is  openess  about being correct or incorrect. On some things that are opinion, sure. On reality? Not the case.  I mean, I'm not running around believing John Kerry actually won the election despite the evidence, although I certainly could, if I approached the election results with  an open mind . Although I could....hmmm...just have to keep it up for 4 years!  -Mach

0	Now you're claiming that a gun is a precision machine. Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as  assault weapons  are  inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip . Which is it?  Prove it then.  Then you've got absolutely no justification for supporting gun control, you should be supporting criminal control instead.  Then why do you keep supporting laws that would restrict access to guns, rather than making it harder for violent offenders to get out of prison and back on the streets where they pose the greatest danger?  Then what's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms? Do you fear something in particular? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better?
0	Philosopher, as per: "I think the difference is that apes act on instinct."  The answer is: What you think and what Science has shown during the past 40 years are two entirely different things. (I won't even bother clarifying it.)
1	Total of denials = 761,814  Violent Crime and Murder rate decreased.  Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989&#8211;2008
1	**The "methodology" of science is not materialism/mechanism/darwinism, but simply empiricism leading inductively/abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method. Neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism/mechanism, nor did they originate from within that metaphysic, despite the beliefs of materialist/mechanists to that effect.Unfortunately, some 150 years ago, that methodology was set aside, and has remained out of sight, with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as 'darwinism'.
1	Actually, I'm not looking for shootouts at all with the criminal element. But what is crazy in my opinion, is admitting that there are holes in the system that allow criminals to get automatic weapons illegally, and you see the solution as banning automatic weapons from being purchased by law abiding citizens rather than screaming for the holes in the system to be fixed so the criminals can't get them. It seems to me that you have an anti-gun agenda and will use any flaw in the system as an excuse to ban all guns for all people. Is that a fair assessment of where you stand?
0	But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against  choices  is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices.
1	The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary.
0	Well if it saves my life what is the problem??  Aren't we pro life here?????
0	btw, i'm 17... well, 18... (almost yay!)  bullsh*t. you do get critized for tlaking about god... any other god other than the christian god that is.
0	How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
1	The prediction was NOT made based on the theory of evolution, but on the fact that there were fossils up until a certain time, then there were no more fossils and nobody had seen the thing. What's so hard to understand here?
1	I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.
1	You are a foreigner yourself I recall you admitting. What do you lable that? :)
1	Right. That certainly explains the many, many versions of Christianity.
0	Wow! Supersport got something right!
1	And if you wind up killing somebody with a less-lethal device then you've got a mess of legal issues facing you. It's better to avoid such headaches.

0	This is exactly what I said in a pm to her. I also suggested that she talk to women who have had abortions, who have not, who have had adoptions, and who have been adopted. I wish there was some kind of "place" you could go to automatically get this kind of dialogue. Not internet sites, but face to face stuff.Want to start a counseling center? :)
1	60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.
0	 [On ancient Athens]: In the end, more than freedom, they wanted security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost it all &#8211; security, comfort, and freedom. When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again.  &#8211; Edward Gibbon  History repeats itself when forgotten.
1	Yet every good deed they do is ruined by their war against us. Until they stop this war upon us, their attacks on our families, and their fight to remove our freedoms through the tyranny of the majority at the ballot box, I will continue to consider them evil, destructive, and enemies of freedom. Remember even Hitler did some good for the German people all the while committing evil acts.
0	I think you are the same person as usa all the way and again.. you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post.  And no.. the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby and I don't know if there is a god or not. Btw..

1	Well if mass public shootings are so rare and so unlikely to happen in the rest of the world, how do you explain the school shootings in Germany?  Furthermore, if public shootings are so damn rare, why did Germany make their already extremely strict gun control laws even stricter than ever?
1	Care to define presupposition? Clive asked me to debate him a while ago, and I told him I would pick and study a topic. I have done that, and, here we are.
1	Damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge. Do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang', he was mocking it. Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe, which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence.FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right? Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.
1	I know very little about evolution, but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes, so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape. Instead, I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor, but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago.  Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me, since I said, I am by no means an expert on evolution.
0	Know it.
0	Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.
1	Did you notice the word "tend" in there?  Humans (in general) are actually very careful about protecting their young. Many organisms just produce a few thousand offspring and leave. Obviously, all of those offspring cannot survive.
1	It is my understanding that it involves only domestic violence misdemeanor cases with a conviction.
0	Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?
1	face it -- life has stumped science -- it cannot be defined, it cannot be measured...it cannot be explained in any sort of scientific way.

1	As I said the gene was from its inception a theoretical construct developed to explain certain observations on pea plant characteristics. A convenience in describing how the traits were observed to be inherited. Its never been hard linked to any specific molecular architecture except for the short period of the one-gene one-enzyme (or protein) hypothesis. The concept grows more and more complex at the molecular level, but it also remains viable as a means of describing and studying the heritable elements underlying phenotypic traits at the conceptual level. Thats a tribute to the initial mental feat of Mendel in coming up with the original concept!By the way there are no points or lines or squares or circles etc. Geometry must be dead don't ya think?
1	I think the semi-tragic error supersport - and other strongly religious people - make when triumphantly posting links like this is that he assumes everyone invests their beliefs concerning the universe with the same degree of emotion and self-worth as he does. This assumption is explicitly stated on occasion, whenever 'darwinism' or evolution or some other scientific field of study is described as a 'religion'. To SS, the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented that contradicts ones beliefs. The idea that someone could respond to an upheaval or revolution in our understanding with excitement, anticipation or delight is entirely foreign to him.
0	As long as we cut off the privates of the fathers as well.
1	Substantiate this claim.
0	No, i was not trying to make that point. I was in a heterosexual marriage for many of the same reasons that Justine has addressed. I just have never mentioned it before in this forum.
1	What is your evidence they didn't do this? Remember, today's Coelacanth is different.
1	well, I thought Another Opinion covered my belief fairly well so why bother? There is always the option not to respond to me.
1	So, I assume that you bought all of the liberal demogoguery about the big health insurance companies making obscence profits on the backs of dying people?  Here's a little factual info for you. There was a recent ranking on the profitability of a wide variety of Industry types. I believe it was done by Forbes. The health care insurance companies ranked 35th in profitability with an ROI of 2.2%. To put that in perspective, if the companies fired all of their employees and converted all of their assets to cash, they'd have made more money putting in in a bank and drawing interest.
0	Because, not once, did I have feel any sort of physical attraction to the same gender as myself. I have known other people who have. I don't 'CHOOSE' who I think is sexually attractive.  It might have been environmental, but it certainly wasn't a 'choice'  I have to assume that at least for some , if not most homosexuals, that pattern repeats itself.
1	Actually, Simone, if you spend more time on their website and research a little deeper, you will find that they are also "right wing wingnuts" but they happen to want "sensible" gun policies in order to eliminate violence (clearly delineated from war) with the use of guns in all countries.Essentially they are the ones you are griping about and stereotyping. Provide a decent basis of argument besides a stereotype please.
1	Note the operative word is particular. The point being there are a miriad of people who can take on the responsibility of a born child. That is not the case in pregnancy.
1	The latter does happen, though not often enough to explain evolution. Again, your're bending over backwards to exclude one part of the ToE, but you're using other parts of the ToE to try and do so. And you can certainly 'say' whatever you like; what would help is some evidence.
0	I know what you mean, my Girlfriend says I always put on a goofy grin every time I get my photo take or if I don't do that I seem to close my eyes just as the picture is taken.
1	Even Darwin objected to the use of the phrase  survival of the fittest  in refering to his theories. He never used the phrase before the 4th edition of  Origin  and then he never used it without also making a reference to natural selection.
1	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by  higher  animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.
1	Oh and let us not forget the wonderful couples of just a generation or two ago. Johnny Mathis and partner, Edwin August partner to Jack Kerrigan, Gareth Hughes, producer Ryszard Ordynski and play set designer George James Hopkins, stage actors Franklin Pangborn and Edward Everett Horton and oh so many more. Some were indeed wonderful, some were leturous playboys who moved with the "Gay" crowds. But never were they shunned or their careers ruined because of it. In fact, some of their careers flourished because of their associations.
1	You would do yourself a favour to drop it permanently. Nobody who understands the second law of thermodynamics believes it precludes the possibility of complexity increasing at a given place.
1	Cherry picking won't cover up the fact that in general developed nations with strict levels of gun control have much lower gun crime rates than the US. You're missing the big picture. Besides, the shooter of German school students got the gun from his father's legally owned gun collection.
1	It would be interesting to here this college professors explanation of these.  There will always be people who do not like your rights, and will go to extended means to slick you out of them!
1	And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights, not a judge.
1	And we've already presented, countless times in the past, that all evidence points to less than 1% of guns recovered from crimes being traced back to gun shows. Ergo there is no emergency that needs to be addressed by forcing private citizens to carry out documented transfers in a business setting.
1	Even if they work together sometimes, the times that they don't is enough to make your claims nonsense. Apparently you have never watched a pride of lions, or a pack of wolves or coyotes eat. The strongest eat first. When food is scarce, some may not survive.
1	Some creationists would probably think he's a genius. Unfortunately for him, that's not exactly something to brag about.This example was used on IIDB and shows the dichotomy with which SS's views conflict with reality: Polar bears are birthed in temperate climates all the time, thanks to zoos. Do they revert back to the fur color of a brown bear? No. Instead, SS finds a picture of dirty polar bear cubs and says, "Look, brown!"Another good simple counterargument is that superspeed adaptation would prevent anything from dying due to extreme conditions at birth. Maybe SS would like to take his chihuahua to Antarctica to birthe its puppies and see if they even live, let alone look like Siberian huskies.
0	You know what else doesn't have any hope/potential of maturing into sentient beings, Archie? Aborted fetuses.  Game-set-match.
0	"attack on the definition of marriage"? Why is it an "attack" to include gay couples in as married? Would it be an "attack" on something for blacks to not have to be segregated from whites?
0	So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?  Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.  Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?  Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume  armed citizens  would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not.
1	You're giving them waaaaay too much credit. All of these amendments were prepared and supported by the same national organizations working with local groups. They've heard the arguments about how broad these laws are and haven't changed a single one. They know exactly what they're doing. In a few cases, after assuring people that they didn't intend to interfere with domestic partnership legislation, they filed suits to do exactly that once the amendment passed.
0	I see. Then you have none?
1	What does "hangs on nothing" mean? Really, what does it mean? In context? Your interpretation?Do you think the Earth "hangs on nothing"?
0	So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.
1	Yes, there is some disagreement on how to classify the fossils designated as H. habilis. What of it? Yes, there is disagreement on whether the specimens themselves represent a direct ancestor or a closely related side branch. What of it? The point is that these fossils are clearly intermediate in characteristics between modern humans and ancient apes. They do fit very nicely on the family tree, either on the direct line to humans or very close to that line.
1	In science, a scientific method actually exists. There is no scientific method in creationism. Religion cannot use the scientific method.
0	I've asked this question and many others you may see me post, in a number of other forums. I've recieved similar arguments, about a country not deciding to invade us. No Particular country was ever mentioned, However, if possible, I would like to belatedly clarify that I am asking this question in the context of the time we are now living in, as opposed to any other time. (I'm not sure if I made that at all clear in the post that started the thread.)  (I take it that this question has been asked before in this forum, rather recently, I assume??? If not in an initial thread post, then perhaps within another thread.)
0	And teen sex doesn't, by the very nature of it's action, result in ending a life that would grow into a toddler, a child, an adolescent, and an adult--basically the action of killing someone.
0	It's not that we pro life people don't care about womens rights it's that we care about the babies rights too. They won't do abortion after the 3rd month right? Well the baby is living, it has a heartbeat, it has nerves, eyes, and all that. I think it is sickening when people say that the baby or fetus whatever you want to call it doesn't feel anything. Everyone always says "what if they get raped? Would you have the baby?" Well for one only 1% of abortions are done because of rape. Secondly if you are raped you can go to the hospital and tell them what happened and they will do an emergency IUD. Why does the women get to choose who can come into the world? They are going to kill it and they don't care. You never knew what the baby could have been. They could have been the one to find the cure to cancer, aids, or another uncurable disease. Your not giving the baby a chance and that is wrong and not fair. Thats my opinion.
1	Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.  In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.
1	Correct. Form letters go in a junk pile. Individual letters are a different matter.
1	Bertvan: Perhaps Dr. Pigluicci doesn’t see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system. Most people do see a difference. The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable. On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as “temperature and embryonic diet” might cause proteins to fold differently and thus “whip up” complex systems such as “eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shells” .

1	You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools.

A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that "theory". That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis. Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out. 
1	I can see how these things might be confusing. He's talking about intelligence at the cellular level. I cannot fathom a single-celled or even a small multi-celled being having any intelligence whatsoever. To me, intelligence implies a processor with sensors and outputs based solely on the information received resulting in some action by the intelligent being...ie a brain. Becoming agitated or sloth by heat, pressure or chemicals does not appear to require intelligence.  The survival of the 'cheating' bacteria is a happenstance mistakenly attributed to some deliberate action on the part of the survivors...I think.
1	Nothing. "T. Kennedy" is an alias of a known terrorist.
0	Because you don't give a damn about the circumstances of the woman. All she is to you is a pregnancy and nothing more.
1	You have to be logical and realistic in your expectations of what can demonstrated/observed as evolution in action and what can only be described from evidence from the distant past.We can see the evolution of organisms in the world today, but because of the reproductive timeframe of many creatures we would not expect to see signifcant evolution take place in their populations over the last couple of hundred years. Take something that reproduces fast enough and great changes can be seen- look at the HIV virus and the myriad separate strains that have developed from a common ancestor in just a few decades of observation.Ancient life can never be observed in its living state- all we have are the remains of these creatures in the form of fossils. As we can position these remains in time using stratigraphy and radiometric dating we can see what their relative temporal positions were. By comparing similar forms we can see how a descendant differs from its ancestor so we can determine how the structure of that line changed with time. So we see what has changed and when but we cannot see the exact "how", in the ancient instance at least (this is where the study of the modern gives insight).
0	I have to agree with you. The Mother is usually the one responsible for conceiving the baby. The man should be responsible too, but she's the one who will get pregnant and she has to consent to sex. I don't think a woman should have the right to do what she likes with her body and kill her baby whenever she gets pregnant. I think the responsibility rests with the Mother first in this case, and the baby should not die for her.
0	Really? Funny, my son, even before I "came out" didn't think gays were bad or being gay was bad. He saw hate as being the real evil...and you exemplify that just perfectly...brava! emoticon_rolleyes
1	You stated that the global flood could not have happened because it is inconsistent of observable science, correct?  Therefore, you are assuming that God is constrained by observable science.  Your argument is not rational, or logical, it is insanity, although it is far better than I expected.
1	Well played! I guess when someone does nothing but spout lies, all that baloney finally catches up in the form of embarassing contradiction...
0	I'm not in denial about anything and don't think Evo's are stupid because they don't agree with me. Obiviously, things don't work both ways.
0	You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?
0	Exagerating the position of another is a typical technique for ridiculing it moose, but your attempts to do that does nothing to detract from the accuracy of the article and my opinion, in that this is a premeditated agenda in order to normalize the homosexual lifestyle within one more generation in this Country. And only a liar would deny it as it's so obvious. If what I say wasn't true then gay groups would take the attitude of hands off off the minds of minors until they're old enough to decide for themselves what is morally right and wrong. What is going on can only be defined as INDOCTRINATION, So you can laugh all you want to, but I'm not laughing at all.
1	so your claim is that the date means that your "joke" is based on reality? It takes more than that.
0	1. This was a statment based on british intelligence. Bush said  The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.  Now tell me how this is a lie. Did the British NOT say this?  2. Taliban is gone. Most of the top terrorists are caught. Osama is defanged and I beleve will be caught in the next few months.... How is this a lie?  3.  Uh I am an anti-american kool-aid drinker... Free thinking is what my government tells me to think.....  
1	So would these liberal firearms owners fail an ethics exam?  "Even if you gave liberals the answers on an ethics exam, they&#8217;d fail." -OldSarge
1	What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed  recent immigration,  than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time, unless I misinterpreted it. But then again, I think it's possible that  micro-evolution  does happen in some birds such as finches.
0	Actually no, Duo has not. If you had ever bothered to read any previous posts by Duo in THIS forum you would ALREADY know he explained this assertation multiple times.  You are once again making assumptions.
1	Strawman argument. Under the anti-gun standard of review, a straw purchase involves buying a gun for anyone other than yourself, with no exceptions.
0	based on the idea that people are dispensible, particularly if they obstruct your well-being. a woman would abort her baby because being a mother contradicts her idea of well-being. in the same way we send soldiers to kill the enemy if they are deemed contrary to the well-being of our countrycan you be against abortion and pro-war?
1	There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction. As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the "Son of God" and the "Son of Man", which means Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws.
0	I don't mean to get off on a tangent here, but it's our duty to protect ourselves? Right is one thing, but duty?
1	You are perhaps thinking of the Miller-Urrey experiment. No one expected life to appear. They were merely curious about what would happen if they simulated the conditions of the early Earth.Since then, we've found pretty much the same thing in the interior of stony meteorites, including an excess of L-forms. So, it's confirmed the findings of Miller-Urey. None of this has anything to do with evolution, however.Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time. This happens in populations; individuals don't evolve. Everything else in evolution is an elaboration of this phenomenon.
0	yes, we will send you to the camps and all of us will gather in our black robes and dance around a fire while we make you dig ditches. emoticon_rolleyes
0	There are all kinds of social services, religious and otherwise available that will provide assistance to any woman who wants to carry her baby to term........When pro abortion people use that as and argument it is just a red herring and smoke screen........
0	Well there is bias on both sides of the issue.........I did look at the film from about 3 different sites and I don't think you can deny that baby is trying to avoid those forceps that want to take its life..........
0	I see no stigmatism either.
0	Explained away means what? If you don't agree with the mainstream you are wrong. He has not been refuted and he has lots of pictures. Why not go to his site and look?
0	What asshattery! This was addressed. Freud thinks:  A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity   -Sigmund Freud ,  General Introduction to Psychoanalysis   I cut and paste, research raw data post raw data to backup my claims. You misrepresent cases. Use this Besilles collective right theory, cut and paste XXXX form victim disarmament, anti civil rights groups and hide your true colors of wanting to ban all guns. At least on my side WE ARE CLEAR in our goals.....  BTW am I correct that YOU DO NOT EVEN LIVE IN THE US ANYMORE?!?!?
1	This contradicts the fact that logic is an invention born of brain power. If there were no living beings, there would be no logic. There would be plenty to think about but nobody to do any thinking requiring what we know today as logic. Logic is TOTALLY a human construct....and since it has nothing at all to do with the existence of God, atheists are just as good at it as the Bible Thumpers. As a matter of fact, I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I've heard to date.
0	YOu mean they don't eat, sleep , pass wastes, fight (not neccesarily physically) for dominance in their social setting, react to the opposite sex, put on displays for the opposite sex, and things like that?   How very odd.
0	Millions of people died before guns came into existence. Hundreds of thousands per day, per incident. Prove otherwise.
1	Hardly. Given how you abandon thread after thread after thread, I'm just using those to mock your level of intelligence and education.There's really no point in debating your specific threads as you cowardly run away from them on a weekly basis.I just like to remind people that you have no understanding of erosion that are so gulliable you bought hook line and sinker the paintings of villagers who based their art on comic books as proof of creation.
1	Because evolution is a scientific theory, and has evidence for it. Creationism is religion. ID is bad science, and bad theology.. and there is no evidence for. If you look at the people who push it, and the place where their funding is coming from, you can see it is a religious front for far right CHristians. Many Chrisitans do not have a problem with evolution. They are what are known as 'theistic Evolutionists', who feel that God directs the course of evolution. The intelligent ones of those realise that is a religious belief, not something that can be proven, hence it is an object of faith. Evolution can be demonstrated in the lab. It makes predictions that can be tested. And, with 150 years of testing, it has not been able to be falsified.
0	But not at the expense of people spreading lies about science and forcing religious untruths into science classes.
1	No. That's the hypothesis. A theory has been tested. That means that from the hypothesis a prediction is made that has the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, the prediction must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory.
0	As long as it resides within said woman - you bet. Kind of like you get to decide the rules for your house and who you are gonna let in the door OR throw out when they become detrimental to your household in some way.
0	Actually it does make it so, since you can search every abortion debate ever had on this or any forum and the prevailing argument by the pro-abortionist is the nullification of human rights by the unborn because they aren't sentient human beings yet. You must deny their humanity in order to ease your consciences as flaming liberals since you are condoning, endorsing and defending the murders of more than a million real human beings each year in the USA alone. What it comes down to iangb, is that you secularists will lie to yourselves as needed in order to convince yourselves that what you're doing isn't mass genocide of the most innocent and defenseless class of people among us. So continue to lie to yourself if it gets you through the day, iangb. Convince yourself that you can pick and choose what is absolute truth in this life too, and see how far that gets you. What is so sad about you sanctimonious secularists is that you look at us so condescendingly when you don't have a clue about what's true or what really matters in this life. If it wasn't so pathetic, it would actually be humorous.
1	You obviously dont know what your talking about. Ever since Florida became the first state to allow people to carry guns around Florida has been number 1 or 2 in violent crime each year according to the FBI!
0	Really, so you are totally knowable? Show me the site that has the Mach User-Manual where I can know everything about you.
1	Yes, but how do you legally get it into international waters? Once there, where do you go? There aren't too many ports where ordinance is allowed. Since I am a law abiding citizen, where, other than international waters, may I legally have a gun?
0	You praise my former country's health care plan, championing it over anything else America might have...and you don't even know whether or not they get sick pay from work?  First you praise Canada's system, even though it only applies to Canadian citizens and it's a three year wait to become nationalized. And now you're praising Britain and you don't get sick leave over there.
0	Amen mekayla, and welcome to the forum. Now prepare for the ensuing hate speech which is sure to come from the pro death and infanticide advocates who are sure to attack you for daring to share your common sense and compassionate opinion.
0	Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.  I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.  I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.  We all lead your typical normal life.
1	See above.  I don't see any of those listed above having any influence over the millions of other scientists out there that must be complicit in order for your generalizations to hold water.   Evangelical atheist , nice term by the way, it's no  truthiness  but it might catch on.
1	Save 95% of fetuses? Pro-lifers have a weird obsession with non-sentient fetal tissue. emoticon_xdonno
1	Sorry but I think you are mistaken in that the bible  describes  dinosaurs. The first description is most certainly a description of the hippopotamus, which were abundant in Egypt, etc. The second seems to be crocodile of some sort. Most likely the Nile crocodile. Tanniyn is not just described as dragon, but also as serpent or scaly creature. At that time there was no other large scaly creature other than the Nile crocodile. They might have been describing a whale, but whales do not have scales.  As to your claim of evolution, that depends on what  God  would mean by  create.  YOU can create something out of something else can't you? So than evolution is a possibility.
0	And you know what I saw when I looked at that photo.  I saw a ridge.  If that turns out to be a 5000 year old wooden boat, I will go enroll at the local synaguge, and go to services every week.
1	I need to pick you up on this as IC has never been identified. As such you cannot use it to 'prove' something incorrect.  I will respond to your other points but my wife insist I turn the laptop off.....
1	Yes it does, by the definition of existence. We can't determine whether something exists or not if we do not define  existence.  I define it like this:  If something exists, then it can be detected.  If something cannot be detected, then it doesn't exist.  Note that the converses are not necessarily true.  Theists define  God  as something that cannot be detected. Therefore, their god does not exist. Pantheists define  God  as the universe. Polytheists define their gods as superhumans who live on top of mountains. This proof cannot disprove pantheism or polytheism, but it disproves theism.
1	Same place. Australia.  That, after 5 or 6 thousand illegal guns were just handed in during the last in a series of never-ending amnesties.
0	So if a story in the bible is proven to be true, like the fact that there is enough water in the ice caps, and the atmosphere to cover the highest mountains, then these "myths" would become less rediculous? Or would there be a logical explanation other than a higher life form did it? Mayabe a crazy man built a big boat at the right time and happened to have two of each animal at the time? But that would be crazy talk. Wouldnt it?
1	If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she can abstain from sex. ;)  It works!
0	While your story is a sad one I disagree that you should be happy with having a "second chance". I believe this because you gave your unborn child no chance.I probably shouldn't say "you" because it seems like you didn't have a choice in the matter. Anyway, thank you for sharing your story and welcome to the forums.
1	OK.
0	My bad, Daewoo. How inconsiderate of me!  emoticon_smile emoticon_smile
1	Great insight and response to him. I too had my doubts about the veracity of the global warming claims at every level of the propaganda they have spewed from so many different sources, for so long. And those very sources have been exposed as participants in this scam now, which just makes my decade... emoticonXHoho Here's a link to a link I posted in the debate about the scam of carbon credits right here on 4forums back in January of 08, and an excerpt from that article. Read some of the defenders posts and look at the sources they rely on to justify the global warming scam. It's absolutely incredible how they just lap up the lies and follow the propaganda like lambs to the slaughter.Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit' Fraud?By Noel Sheppard (Bio | Archive)April 25, 2007 - 21:54 ET It’s conceivable that years from now, America’s media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history: the idea that a wealthy person, for instance, soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore, can purchase “carbon credits” to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote “carbon neutral.”Given the media’s love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria, few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is.However, on Wednesday, an impeccably reputable publication, the Financial Times, published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore, Laurie David, Sheryl Crow, and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever (emphasis added throughout):http://www.4forums.com/political/297828-post25.html
1	Why? All pro-choicers want abortion to be rare because women aren't having UPPs or health problems in the first place.
0	Really Matt.I guess you were trying to be funny or ironic, but I don't find it so. I sympathize with your point, of course, but your content comes off a little, well... nuts. You come off sounding more like Archy than you know. Sorry, that's a terrible thing to say to someone, but ...Simply put, I don't see how this adds any thought to the discussion.
0	And how do we know that she would have wanted it. What if the Petersons got into a fight because Laci found out Scott had been cheating on her and that was the reason why he killed her? What if they would otherwise have gotten a divorce and then she would have gotten an abortion because she no longer wanted the baby?
1	I think the reason for the differences in translations is because the translations i think are geared more to audience. There are easier translations for little kids and those who have a hard time with bigger words. Another thing that has to be taken into account is that it is not always easy to translate exactly from one language to another. Some English words have several equivalents in other languages so the differences in the translations come from which equivalent was chosen by the translators.  P.S. This of course is not to argue with what the person stated above.
0	Considering the avg number of capital punishments a year is around 70..... think of the 4000 babies in the womb that arent guilty of any crimes that are everyday being slaughtered through abortion.....  Just putting some things in perspective for you......  Just as many people died in the world trade center attack on September 11th, thats how many babies die from abortion everyday in America....  There have been 2000 soldiers that have died in Iraq... thats only half the number of babies that die everyday from abortion on our own soil....  What a shame for the  land of the free  that has  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ...  THERE IS GENOCIDE HAPPENING AND NO ONE IS STANDING UP FOR THE TRUE INNOCENT AMONG US! in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION! Truly they are for the life of the innocent right.... ???? (said sarcatically)
1	Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated. If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.  Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea. Thefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators, although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts. Why's that?  What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?
1	You forgot selection. Selection is the opposite of chance.
1	And quote supposedly a former Justice who ignores the fact that one man = one vote. The NRA doesn't get to vote and just like guns, people vote and people kill people sans guns. Death by any firearms is far down the list! Attempting to move a fundamental right to the top of the list is ill advised and dangerous to a free people and the nation as a whole.
1	Actually, no. A specific fossil cannot be, and probably will never be, identified as the ancestor of birds with any certainty. It is doubtful that the fossil record will ever be so complete as to make that possible. Your remark tends to support the confusion of creationists. They tend to represent the idea of a transitional as ancestral. Since the ancestral status of any particular fossil can't be acertained for any given fossil, and since any given fossil is usually placed in one of the major taxonomic groups, creationists feel justified in claiming that it is just a bird - thus, no transitionals exist.But if you look at life you will see that it is like a bush with many branches. What is being discovered in China is part of the bush that was the lineage from theropod to avian, as was Archaeopteryx. That bush is what is expected from evolutionary theory. There are several fossils that show a progression from dinosaur to bird. We don't expect a ladder-like chain of a single lineage that evolved until a point that it branched into the birds. There are many lines along that path that went no where but were similar to the one that became the birds.
1	Well that does make sense given that one would not expect you to understand environmental pressures on mutations if you can't even understand erosion.Would you expect someone to understand quantum physics if they could not even understand force? No. Therefore [u]it predicts that one who does not understand some of the most basic things will not understand the complex.[u]
1	Yes, they do. So why should you make the same mistake? We correct creationists about this mistake all the time on other boards. See talkorigins debate board. That Hi_Its_Me went along with the mistake showed that he was no longer discussing evolution or even science, but arguing atheism vs theism.The reason we do this is because science and evolution are not atheism and scientific theories have boundaries. No scientific theory gives a worldview or an explanation of everything. Even the anticipated "theory of everything" combining Relativity and QM won't explain everything. Evolution has the boundary of the first life. It assumes that a universe and living organisms exist. Just like Cell Theory assumes the same things. If you want to discuss the origin of the first life, then you have to talk about the various theories within the field of abiogenesis. If you want to talk about the origin of the universe, then you need to discuss the various theories within the field of cosmology.
1	And you say juleacatz is the one who views pregnancy as a punishment for women.
1	Any surgery that is needed for life threatening illness are taken care of ASAP. None life threatening, but life quality illnesses are the one that take time. Hip and knee replacements Life quality. Cancer life threatening.  Now, if I am not mistaken, a poorer person without health care coverage in the US would never recieve a hip replacement operation? Or am I wrong?
0	and she got punished for it  Good thing too because it led to the law being changed. If someone thought drunk driving was an unrighteous law and so they did it and got punished...I don't think you will see much sympathy. It many states that is probably true for abortion.  Why is it unrighteous anyway? Only because you disagree with it
1	And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically (read: deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with (for example) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time) in order to work.  I can't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards.
1	So I gotta ask, how does that prove that evolution is allegedly atheistic when there are many other Gods out there?
1	 A pretty important ?  Actually, not really. The ToE has evidence from all over the various domains of life. Human evolution isn't too much more relevant than bacterial evolution.
1	And it provides no real insight to the issue.It states detail on California case, but makes little specification on any of the other states.Considering the opposition to interracial marriage was THREE to ONE AGAINST, it's hard to believe that a state legislature would just decide to buck the electorate and legislate the laws away of their own volition.
1	I don't know if we can be as accurate as a couple of million years, but I agree that the age of the earth is just right for supporting man.
1	Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called "womens issuses" be in valid?
0	And who is the 'WE' that we trust? The scientists or the theologians, who disagree with each other?  I am curious for it on my own account.. and not willing just to accept someone's authority saying it happened one way or another.
1	Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can.
0	Well let me say that so far that you haven't been doing a very good job. My arguments are completely solid, and you haven't even gotten close to refuting them. You accuse me of being stupid because my mom watched star trek, you refute my arguments by providing the defonition of masturbation and periods, and then you call me illogical and tell me to think about my statements more deeply.[quote]You said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester, which I already know. But saying that you don't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement.[quote]Let me rephrase that. The beginnings of my body existed. What you know as "me" the person who's saying this, did not exist. My brain, which is really "me" did not exist.
1	Don't think so. Provide an example of an  unbridaled capitalist  system operating in the 19th century.
1	Big deal.  She is entitled to her opinion.  Should she become pregnant, regardless of the circumstance, we in the Pro-choice camp would support her choice, no matter what it was.  BTW, why aren't you profetallifers coming out strongly in favor of the woman in CA who has the litter of kids?  After all, she  saved  some of the embryos you fight so hard to protect.  Why aren't you raising money to help her support her kids, or in fact does your concern stop once they are born and real people?
1	I find the neo-marxist approach to political science interesting and useful. Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.  I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful. Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.  I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)  I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.  I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces. This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute, efficiency.  There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them. How do you feel about marxism, socialism and communism, and why?
1	I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people.
1	But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions. The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself.
0	you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing
1	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.
1	Gee, Jo, you really should have read your sources. There is one part in here about the French 'navy' and Churchill you really should read :)
1	No, it wasn't. Given the number of scientists one might assume that at least one would confuse his science with his religion. It seems that according to AIG, 182 actually do. I really have to commend AIG in that they did not list  Dr.  Kent Hovind,  Dr.  Carl Baugh,  Dr.  Don Patton. However, the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who's highest earned degree is an MS in physics, his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate, Christian university. Clifford Burdick has a  degree  from a non-university (as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the  University of Physical Sciences , from which Burdick claimed his degree:  'The University is not an educational institution, but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science. There are no campus, professors or tuition fee. ). Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his  degree  from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year. I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator.  I presume that the rest of the  scientists  listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed.  I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list, now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life. The name  Steve  (and variations thereof) comprises about 1% of the population. The percentage of qualified scientists with that name cannot be far from the norm. The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology, geology, paleontology, or a related scientific field. However, there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory. For example, Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list.  I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list. I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts. Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees.  Oh, yes. In my experience, creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists. On the other hand, there are lots of scientists who were once creationists, before they became scientists. As many polls have shown, the more educated a person becomes, the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist.
1	Oh, and I found this from here:  http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.   It appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. And the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. The only one getting anything wrong here is you.
1	It's not just cars and catalytic converters have greatly decreased emissions.
0	That's really simplified. It's not like a woman's body is a suitcase and the fetus is biologically self-reliant. It lives off her life processes - her blood, her immune system, her calories - it puts stress on her joints, muscles, heart, and bladder. Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental. No a baby isn't the woman's body - but a pregnancy IS.
1	That isn't what it says at all, it says he took pains as in he made this point particularly clear. Whilst genes are reacting to changes in human behaviour (which isn't news, there are loads of examples like this. One of the best ones would be how alcohol tolerance varies across the world between cultures who have used fermentation and those that traditionally boiled water) he is making it clear that these behavioural changes are not genetic.
0	Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.
1	Really? If "nature" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been "eliminated" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your "individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type. Even animals that have "normal" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor. Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is "the standard" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is "natural" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a "greater purpose". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given "purpose" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was "made" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or "life", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water.
1	Actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. This is illegal. You can't make it more illegal than it already is.  Shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around. Nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around. Many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law.  As far as puncture wounds, do stabbings count?  Or, as it appears, are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?

I agree with what he was trying to do, but you're right that this is something that should not be enforced.  If this becomes a precedent, private lives are pretty much out the door. Might be a bit alarmist, but this makes me think that legislated sex is next.
0	In a subway station, 1 day after 4 more botched bombings, which followed 4 deadly bombings? Absolutely. Kill him...twice. I also kinda got the impression that when he was tackled to the ground that he tucked his arms under his body, and it could be thought that maybe he was attempting to get at a detonator, or actuate a detonator. Great job in my opinion.  I was also thinking, that perhaps a terrorist could gain great benefit from what happened in this case by learning the programmed response and tactics of the police. It almost seems like the media has been holding school on how and how not to be a terrorist bomber lately.
1	So? Genesis cannot be proven in the slightest.
1	Can you tell us what you would accept as "proof"?You can be shown any number of transitional sequences that demonstrate evidence, but the level of evidence needed for your own personal "proof" is up to you.Proof is for mathematics, science works by evaluating competing theories using evidence and eliminating those which do not predict observed results.
1	Because the theory of evolution is the result of science and therefore should be taught in science class.  ID is NOT science and therefore should NOT be taught in science class.  It's that simple.
1	I believe you are misinterpreting Mr. Madison. James Madison made it clear throughout his writings that a powerful government was something to be worried about and carefully watched.  But, lets say your right. Where do you draw the line? For example: seeing as religion has most likely killed more people than cancer, under your theory, what is to stop government from outlawing organized religion? You once told me you were studied in the ways of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, would you be willing to give up your freedom of religion to protect other freedoms?
1	Radiocarbon is nevr used for 'millions of years'. It's used to measure human developments.  I suggest you read this.  Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.  This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another. In the process the paper refutes a number of misconceptions prevalent among Christians today. This paper is available on the web via the American Scientific Affiliation and related sites to promote greater understanding and wisdom on this issue, particularly within the Christian community.
1	Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
0	I never said that the majority of gun owners are racist. If you think that being compared to gay rights activists is somehow demonizing you then perhaps that shows how you feel about gay people. The issue is conservatives using liberal tactics to advance a conservative agenda.
1	I believe I said the military does not use sawed off shot guns, and then I said it does use other forms of shot guns.  You have never did explain why you as a gun owner defends every gun control law Sarah Brady wants!  There is a name for people like you and I believe it is traitor!
1	And if wishes were horses...You've no evidence, AA. None at all. Nothing in the natural world disputes the great age of the earth.

1	You don't believe in inherited traits?
0	So you're saying that a person's right to defend themselves ends at the border of their state of residence?  How about a person's First Amendment rights? Should states be allowed to set limitations on free speech that're radically different from your own home state? Or how about driver's licenses? Should your license only be good in one state and one state only, and driving in a different state is a criminal offense?
1	Abortion targets a very specific group of human beings: unwanted, unborn children.  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.  The Convention defined genocide as any of a series of acts designed to  destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.  The acts listed include among others, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group or forcibly transferring children out of the group.

How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes? How can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different "species" based not on their genes -- which are 99.9% similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull? Evolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing, monkey-loving, chance-worshipping, racist fools.

The man was not arrested for having the gun, was he?

1	I think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? For example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them?Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.) It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. So why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads? One reptile has a type of third eye, but it isn't for sight nor is it permanent. It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult. Then it is covered by scales. Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes? I mean, it didn't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it.Now let's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument. They too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement. Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans? And we all know that humans don't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom. MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights. Insect eyes. Honeybee legs.What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which can't be reasonably or rationally answered, they refuse to even consider them. Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom, but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies. Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental, social and predatory pressures, hasn't it made more diverse selections where needed, as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads, rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today, just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected?

0	As much as it pains me I'm going to agree with Mathew here. If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want. If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.  Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government.
1	Actually, Dembski is known for his useless maths.  As you so enjoy reading Berlinski, do you agree with his take on ID?
1	And I'm addressing your counter-arguments in that regard. One of those counter arguments has been that both chimps and ourselves had four billion years to evolve to our level of intelligence and that during all that time we were subject to the same ecological pressures. Neither of those statements is accurate. The first is misleading for the reasons outlined above, and the second is simply false: humans have experienced greatly different ecological challenges since we diverged from chimps.I'll finish up tomorrow - battery dead.

The supreme court tends to think Due Process clause....you guys seem to think Equal Protection Clause...all of which don't work, this has been discussed and unless you all of a suddent stop supporting a living constitution it seems this won't change.
1	You mean you observed the greek and roman's living it up? You know someone who did? What about when all of the people alive during WWI are dead? Does WWI suddently NOT have happened? Is that how your version of the world works?
1	Do try to keep up with yourself. People like you are always talking about how we need gun control laws in response to the crimes taking place. But you have absolutely no answer for what to do when said laws are violated.
1	Dealing with a designated nuisance species isn't the same thing as hunting. It's wildlife management.
1	too bad darwinian evolution has nothing to do with it.....proven by the fact that not ONE example of a beneficial random mutation can be presented/proven, nor can ONE example of natural selection be proven on the level of the individual. Thus, there's only one thing left....lamarckian inheritance. The body simply has the ability to transmit information about the external environment. It's that simple.see the butterfly link in the OP.
1	and someone with good intentions would... stop them.  some planes can hold hundreds of passengers. the vast majority of them would want to STOP hijackings, not commit them.
1	I think it is worthy of consideration that the first state to enact OGAM legislation 30+ years ago, (South Carolina) rescinded the law in 2004 because no positive benefit was being realized.
1	So the number of deaths due to hospital screw up is almost 19 times higher than the murder rate involving firearms. Quite disturbing if you ask me. To this this suggests that we should look into more tightly regulated medical degrees than anything else.

1	Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.

1	You must have been watching the same sunday morning tv political talk show as I was semi-listening to this morning. Some pro-abortion woman went off on a tangent about the phrase  abortion on demand .  Would  abortion for convienence  be more accurate?
1	That doesn't prove the government shouldn't be armed. It's not like one politician can single-handedly kill millions of people. In fact, if the whole U.S. Congress one day decided to get up from their offices and try to invade a small town called Kittanning, Pennsylvania, they would fail. What it does prove that the government takes guns away because they don't trust the little people. We should all start wondering  why not?

0	Everything basically.  You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. They decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life.

0	Not to derail the thread so soon [cause I'd like to learn and discuss as many reasons and basis as are out  there  for this position (personally against but prochoice)]  but....  What do you mean by  fully human ? Why do you think the fetus is not fully human? Also, why do you place any value in the life of a fetus?
1	This is personal pet-hate...  It is not true to say humans did not evolve from apes - humans are apes and we did evolve from other apes. What we didn't do is evolve from any apes still living today, but our common ancestors with those apes were themselves apes.
1	You obviously missed the point:  It appears that no rational purpose exists for limiting marriage in this state to opposite-sex partners  And as we all know, there hasn't been a rational reason for limiting marriage.
1	I believe I wrote several times that I am not arguing against the rational theory of evolution.
0	This is such a typical response on your part. Don't actually respond to the post, simply deflect the attention to Kerry.  Always "yeah, but John Kerry..." rather than a response that actually considers the content of the post.
0	Well excuuuuuuuuuuuse me. You are obviously not simply inquiring into the way people think then, so instead of asking generally what people think, why don't you tell us exactly who you are looking for so they can present themselves.
0	Like campaigning for better information on and access to b/c you mean? That's what pro-choice groups do. Like seeking to improve benefits and general support for single parents? yup, they do that too.  As an individual, i give up time and resources to help the local family planning clinic. I ran sexual health campaigns at college. I recently did a drive to get goods to sell at a jumble sale, the profits of which go to a local single parent (note - not just single mother) group - and that's just for starters. What do you do to help lower the abortion rate?
1	Not everyone agrees with policy. Afterall look at the Brady Campaign, one of their long time members was leaking classified information to the NRA and other pro-gun groups on purpose.
0	So guns are more important than the safety of women? Then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?  So men love their guns more than women? Is that some kind of homosexuality? Ya know a gun is kind of shaped like, um, you know what. A gun does ejaculate in a sense.
0	Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?  Please, that's just pathetic.
1	This is why religion may not survive the future.  People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.  The only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation.  Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here.
1	In science, a scientific method actually exists. There is no scientific method in creationism. Religion cannot use the scientific method.

0	While I'm not going to consider Dr. Tiller a pillar of society, I'm certainly not going to condone his murder.
0	Oh, I am just so bothered and annoyed that I can't prove my faith!!! Actually, I'm not really that bothered nor annoyed. I know that all the evidence points to creation, i.e. the creation interpretation makes more sense than the evolutionary interpretation. There is very good evidence to suggest the existence of God, for one, the fact that we are all still here is one. If there were no God, than this whole universe would cease to function. I believe the laws of nature and our sciences are man's attempt to describe the normal ways that God upholds His creation. When He acts differently, a miracle occurs. Of course, this is based on the belief that the Bible is true. Many other great scientists, including Newton and Galileo also seemed to believe that science and Christianity were compatible. Reason stems from the belief that the universe is orderly, rational and logical. By the dictionary, reason is the intellectual faculty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. Now, if we are accidents of pure chance (which evolution teaches) than the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. This is just to show that with evolution, you can't be sure of anything, because everything is just an accident. But with an orderly and rational Creator, you can be sure of things and be able to reason.
1	Well either the Pottenger cat/pig/mouse thing is either the truth or they made the whole thing up. I think we are seeing a mirror of this experiment in society today...please notice how diseases are striking people at younger and younger ages....it's not going to get any better, either because people are not taught the reality about nutrition -- and that what they eat not only effects them, but their offspring as well.
1	Just by being something man made, this cannot be a right. Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God. For example, life, liberty, and property. I understand that many people do not have health insurance. It sucks, and everyone knows it. It is not a right, it is a good. Goods can be purchased in a competitive market priced based on the law of supply and demand, well in our capitalist society. This is an expensive good, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have it. That is just the way it goes, there are ways to fix it, there are ways to make it cost less, but not everyone is going to get it no matter how hard we try. Unless, God makes it a right, it is not one.
1	The Big Bang arose from a singularity not from nothing.  This is a clear sign that th reader doesn't understand cosmology or science.  Yet we are supposed to believe that a God created the universe out of nothing especially since there is no shred of evidence for a God.  This topic is covered extensively in the online monthly magazine - Science and Discovery. These folks also debunk the Bible and other religious nonsence.  The name of the organization which I suggest everyone look at is Science Club of Long Island.
1	This thread started with a challenge to God's omnipotence. It had nothing to do with omniscience. Our definition of omnipotent is "having virtually  unlimited authority or influence. That appears to rule out the ability to do every conceivable task, uncluding those that are illogical. It does not diminish the power of God.
1	Marc, explain to me why you'd apply a philosophical definition of evolution, or a business definition of evolution in place of the biological definition of evolution in regards to life.  That doesn't seem to make much sense at all.
0	So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
1	If all you got in school was that the Spanish Inquisition was "at times very strict" than you have been a wee bit undereducated to put it mildly. Let me give you the cliff notes version- the purpose of the Spanish Inquisition was to find anyone who didn't believe exactly what the Church told them to and if they were found to be "heretics," they were gruesomely tortured until they said they believed, or if they didn't they were killed.Now I hope you can see why saying the Spanish Inquisition was "at times very strict" is a GIGANTIC understatement.

1	It was a poll. The 1052 persons are what is know as a  sample  (pronounced SAM-pull). To hear from a majority of voters you would have to ask everyone in the state and then it would be called  an election.  Not a poll.  It was not specifically mentioned that it was a random sample but that can reliably be inferred in that a sampling error was discussed. Most people know this stuff. If they don't, they refrain from shooting their mouth off. That was pretty dumb, even for you.  The poll was done by The Field Poll, which is independent and non-partisan. The statistical detail are here. However that website has numbers and stuff and is not written in Elizabethan English so it may be hard for you.  For everyone else, it is pretty interesting. For example:

0	Well, many argue that pro gay rights is a conservative. They say that conservatives favor government staying out of people's lives and not dictating the way that people should live. They argue that conservative people are using religion, not conservative principle to stand against gay rights. I don't know if that is true; I do know that whether conservative, liberal, both, or neither, I cannot find a way to call myself a good person if I do not support gay rights.
1	Actually...I do believe there ARE laws against people wearing masks in public. IIRC, some locations even have laws against adults wearing masks in public on Halloween.  But, as to the story...Yes, cops are IGNORANT and DO LIE ALL THE TIME.  But, what's new?  As for a trunk loaded with assault rifles...  I've done that several times.  Just not to an airport.  I hope he sues the city and I also hope he (or someone else) takes CA's anti-gun laws to the supreme court.
1	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality.  Barbarian observes:  We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .
0	Yes I was 17 years old before, but if I asked a question, or told my business, I was mature enough to deal with the responses whether they were in my favor or not. Now that I'm 26 I can take people not agreeing with me. I'm not knocking her decision, just her attitude.

1	The report is very recent. Lack of action by the ATF within a few days of a report being released is not evidence of anything. Secondly, the ATF can't just walk into a gun show and randomly choose people to investigate. They have to have specific information about the identity of people suspected of breaking the law at gun shows before investigating. So unless they are given such information about the sellers in the NYC report they can't do anything.
1	But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.

0	Well let me first get to this just so everyone will know which side of the gun issue im on, I am an avid gun owner and I support any laws that target criminals while unafecting lawfull gun owners. I only posted this thread to gather poinions and speculation, mostly from the anti-gun side. They say that we gun owners have a fantasy view of reality after a total gun ban, so I just thought I might like to hear their thoughts on life after a total gun ban. Will some of their views make sense, or will their views be just as crazy as they claim our views are. Inquiring minds want to know!
1	That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.
0	Oh I certainly don't pretend that and certainly didn't claim that either--though a couple of left-wing posters here (who will remain nameless for now) might take the bizarre step of saying my post to you amounted to as much, if history is any indicator. Maybe we'll all luck out and they'll forget their Lenses of Bias at home, and instead read claims people actually make.
1	That is the declaration of independence not the constitution.I can go you one better admendment 9 and 10 talk about certain rights retained by the people.Amendment IXThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. Amendment XThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.The conservatives would argue that by offering same sex marriage that their persute of happiness is denied by gay people even existing and that they have to look at us.
0	So you believe that the person who is going to die has no say so in the matter of what happens to their body?What if they said that because of organ donor shortages that now it would be law in your state that when you die, all of your organs would be taken out of your body and reused without your permission. Would that be OK for them to do? emoticonXConfused
1	I agree with that. Several companies made enough extended magazines in anticipation of the ban that they're still available for a reasonable price ten years later. As a business person the only question is going to be if grandfather rights will again be available if new legislation is passed. I spoke with a gun dealer I know who said manufacturer distributors are already calling dealers trying to determine what post-ban demand might be for pre-ban configurations. Bushmasters will be selling like hotcakes.
1	Well, all Arch could do was attack Evolution.Your point is proven as well as my poll. Besides, the complete and utter failure for creationists to argue their belief on its own merits is a well known fact. There are at least three threads that ask creationists to do just that. There isn't any single one where they even try to do it.They always, always fall back on the false dichotomy of if not A, therefore B. But C through ZZZ may exist. If the sky is not orange, it is therefore brown!

1	**Science is more than a methodology. Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology. If science were nothing more than a methodology, than no science would exist beyond the confines of any particular experiment and/or collection of observations/measurements undergone currently.However, you are right, in so far as 'science' _should not_ be conflated with and confused for any particular philosophy, with the possible exception of empiticism. But 'should' is not the issue. The fact is that, falsely and irrationally, you and other materialist have tried, and with great success unfortunately, to convince the public that your materialism and 'science' are one and the same. Just denying that you have done so, and that you [and your fellow darwinists] continue to do so in your every post, doesn't cut the mustard.
1	oh my, sigma, you haven't posted in awhile.   Illegal as in reaching beyond their power to make this decision.
1	Well, I thought I did. Perhaps you didn't understand.  We can look at the rings of a tree to determine how old it is. We can also determine other things, such as relative lengths of growing seasons and times of catastrophies. If I were to cut down a tree just after it was  created,  I would be able to infer a growth pattern and relative seasonal information.. even though there was no growth pattern and there were no seasons.  In the same way, if we look at a star that is 10 billion light years away, we are seeing the events that happened at that star 10 billion years ago.  If this creationist  response  is correct, and the light we see didn't originate 10 billion years ago, what is the light telling us? It's telling us a story of stellar events that never happened. That's like writing a history book about events that never took place... Or at the very least, that would be like someone reading my daily journal of the events that took place in my life millions of years before I was born.  Unless you can explain why we would see this false information, this response leaves you stuck with a trickster God.  Moreover, true to SkepticGunt's word, this view is unscientific because it is completely unfalsifiable.  Because that's how God made it  is not a scientific claim.

1	The VAST majority of abortions occur within the first trimester. Abortions at 21 weeks and over are pretty rare.
0	I was hit and grounded when I was a kid. I turned out fine. But it looks to me like your parents didn't believe in corporal punishment. Thats why you have your attitude.
1	logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise.
1	And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because  we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it . Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is.  What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.
1	Ditto! With that in mind...I want to let you make your own arguments for your position before I post a rebuttal to any of them, for reasons described above. Instead, though, I can post a brief few arguments of my own.Firstly: the statement you are trying to support is "Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception". However, the word 'life' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning, does not have an absolute biological definition. To quote the wikipedia article on it: "It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms". This is doubly the case when considering the 'life' of an individual, as opposed to the 'life' of, say, a skin cell. For example, a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support, but legally and medically the individual is considered dead.The argument, then: If 'life' has no definitive definition, how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start?Secondly: Consider a zygote. According to you, it is an individual. But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic, or 'identical', twins. Before splitting, it is one 'individual'. Afterwards, it is two. Where has the extra individual come from? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation, when was the start of that individuals life?Thirdly: In contrast to identical twins, consider a chimera organism. A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo, which then goes on to be a single human being. Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals (by your definition), when was the biological start of their life?

1	1984, huh? I'm sure that is all still very relevant. Actually there is a lot of discussion about the nature of Archaeopteryx. Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down. But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional.
1	Rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.  The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.

(I can show you numerous examples of this in the animal kindom if you wish.)Also, what about non-locality. I could post some some weird stuff from physics...any of that count? I'm trying to pin down what is considered "miracle." And why does God have to be involved in a "miracle" anyway?...what if I were to believe that since humans were created in the image of God that we are all capable (or at least have the capacity) of performing our own miracles?

These are professionals, belonging  to the APA, including their former presidents and leaders...Sorry but you  are wrong, the paper includes studies from different countries  on twins, the facts are it is an  environmental  cause not a  genetic cause......that is what the studies are showing and even  the APA is beginning to change it their writing suggesting reparative  therapies will work, depending on the cause...

Of course that is on a per capita basis. No, it is ignorance of sex that is the problem in this situation. In the case of many places in the USA it is sort of like "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing..."

Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!

1	Actually new organs are developed only by MODIFICATION of existing ones. But those modifications are due to chages in the existing physical and chemical structures. New chemical structures can however arise easily by mutation. For example mutation of a single base in chloroplast DNA results in effectively total resistance to the microbial peptide tentoxin. One can indeed turn it on and turn it off with a little genetic manipulation. In addition the specific mechanisms involved are well described in the literature. Glad to supply a set of links if anyone really wants to read them, but will not do so unless requested. CF1 I might add is one of the most important body parts to be found anywhere - most of our food supply depends on its turbine like function.
1	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough. In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work. But gun ownership is still legal there.
1	Bull XXXX. Best I can tell, our Creationist is confusing CAN with CERTAINLY WILL. In certain cases, a specific single nucleotide change CAN be lethal, but that's not at all what the Creationist is claiming. Although this is an imperfect analogy, to see the general flaw in his logic, consider this statement: "Science has now shown that being in a car accident is completely fatal." 
0	We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term  brain-dead ), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights.  I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views.
0	And perhaps you have overlooked the issue of abortion relating to crime. Who knows if were actually aborting future murderers? Aren't you for crime prevention?
1	Well, you are talking to Mr. Statistics here so I am quite aware of how few abortions result from women who become pregnant following rape.... the numbers are not hard to find even from the sort of "official" unbiased sources many pro-lifers seem so quick to decry.For example, first hit on Google.Or if you have the patience to read it, this article.Now we settled that, you are asserting it is fine to deny the women of South Dakota access to abortion if they are pregnant from a rape just because they are in a minority. I have problems with such an approach.

1	The ID movements form of ID states that there are "large gaps" in the theory of evolution that can only be explained by the presence of a supernatural designer. Behe is happy to think that it is the christian god (like the rest of them), but they arn't allowed to say that, because if they do, they violate that annoying ammendment!The ID argument is not scientific, because it's not falsifiable, and has no supporting evidence. The ID movement relies solely on LACK of evidence for evolution, which is complete bunk. Just because we don't know yet, it doesn't mean that godditit. (Incedentally, most of Behe's claims of "Irreducible Complexity" are already destroyed by science, as DamEtel will be more than happy to explain.)
0	Mother's choice available through 1st trimester.  Mother's choice not available after 1st trimester with exception in cases where mother's life is threatened by continuing pregnancy.  Pregnancy due to incest-abortion mandatory.  Pregnancy due to rape-cost of abortion paid by rapist or by the courts who generally let the rapists off scot-free.
1	And neither can millions of other heterosexuals, something you ignore. As for nature, technically anything that occurs ever without supernatural causes is in fact in nature. We are a part of nature. Everything we do is a part of nature. Therefore, by taking the genetic data of two gays, placing it in a egg and having a surrogate mother bring it to term, gays can reproduce themselves.
0	why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom.

0	Which lie is that?
0	You show a gap to be inexplicable via natural forces by trying to explain it via natural forces. You can't do it by hypothesising supernatural forces, because that's just meaningless unfalsifiable speculation. ID doesn't have a different method of searching - all it does is give up quicker. That's how it 'detected design' in the eye; that's how it 'detected design' in blood clotting, the immune system - it just gave up looking for natural explanations and assumed design filled the gap.
0	Abortion is never justifiable homicide. It is never manslaughter. It is never an accidental killing. It is murder. It is the taking of a human life with malice and aforethought. If it goes un-punished in this life, rest assured that it will be judged by your creator in the next life. You liberal females who think that killing un-born children is a healthy activity are going to be in for a great surprise some day.  I have talked to many women who had abortions in their past; all of them were ashamed of what they did. For them, their guilt was almost too great to bear. So, I ask one more time; what person posting on this topic can say that they wish that their mothers had aborted them???
0	That's right, a higher view of the fetus than there currently is typically in our culture. I have no problem with anyone referring to it that way.

1	Actually National Geographic is more accepting of the truth than biased for the argument.  Evidence always speaks for itself.  It is by its very existence, evidence!  When studying with an open mind, one does not attach regilious beliefs to scientific exploration.  One does not creat hoax relics in the openminded search for the truth regarding our history.  One believes established historical facts as a background for research, not as an answer box for the daily questions that arrive during our trek into the past.  Strict Creationists came to the conclusion that the Bible was literally true before they were presented with the evidence that it cannot be so.  Entirely not so. The evidence supporting Creationism is the Bible, written by man, bought and sold in many languages all over the world. The evidence supporting evolution is piled up in museums and institutional collections all over the world. The only evidence that the Creationists are right is that someone said so and we wrote it down. The evidence of evolution is here to touch, study, age-date and ponder. The 6000 year old earth story has been debunked.  Maybe that's your biggest problem, thinking that they're totally opposite. The only thing that messes up the Biblical pie is the time line and our interpretation of how God works.  Understanding what we know now about orbital physics and why space things are almost always spherical in shape, it's laughable to think that the Earth was here before the Sun. Remember, you are reading from things written before man figured out that the Earth is not flat.  No, the Sun was before the Earth, the Earth before the Moon and the tides before intelligent life.  You can take that to the bank!

1	Just this morning there was an article in the paper about a woman in the Extreme Southern part of Texas in Brownsville being shot "with a stray bullet from Mexican soldiers" on our side of the river. Over 80% of the crimes are committed by Mexican gang members, many of which are ex-soldiers and drug enforcement for the mafias.Nope, not safe at all when foreign invaders attack Texans on our side of the river and do pseudo cop break and enters of homes or robbery of businesses.That is a good example of the importance of being armed. One county sheriff along the river encouraged citizens to get armed just for that purpose, freely admitting that his officers will not be there when they are needed the most. We Texans have kidnapping and ransome too but reserve our right to protect ourselves unlike EuroAsia who has copitulated entirely.You were saying?
1	Actually it is more than that. Yes conservatives will be back in power, but I have never seen so much discontent in America period.  I don't know where we got off track but I think it is this. We are Americans, not Democrat or Republican. Our allegiance belongs to the Republic, not to any political group. While we fight and try to score some kind of political points with each and every event, America is burning. Sooner or later, while we bicker endlessly, the American People are going to be fed up with both parties, and move into something yet not discovered.  Heck, the way China is rising in material wealth, and while we mortgage our Children's futures so that we do not have to feel the pain, maybe we will be just presiding over the destruction of the greatest society even known to man.  All of this is possible unless we find the courage to work together for the good of all America, instead of just trying to play got ya with the other party.  It is what I said a few days ago. United we Stand and Divided We Fall!  However, I doubt the Chinese will be anywhere as benevolent as We the People were. But it seems clear that change is coming, but I sincerely doubt that is has very little to do with the kind of change Obama Envisioned!  So belly up to the bar and Get Some discontent Boys! After all we all have earned it!  We reap what we sow!
0	So you're saying that it's better to just let the criminals stay armed and the good people should remain unarmed?  That's advocating to allow the wolf to kill as many sheep as it wants in hopes that it'll stop on its own and leave the rest alone.

1	I don't think that we need to worry about the US arresting and jailing children for playing with toy guns.  There are anti-gun extremists like the VPC and pro-gun extremists like the NRA so I think the result will come out somewhere in the middle as far as gun-control is concerned.

1	The one thing that annoys me the most is the ridiculous way they try to bring the zygote down to the level of a hair follicle.  Hello!?! A hair follicle is practically nothing but dead tissue besides the few cells that make up the base! It is nothing like a zygote, who is a living functioning being. They use this approach in their whole essay as if it made sense.  It made no sense at all, in fact, it made them look awfully stupid when I read it. I shudder to think how many people may be deceived by this thing if they don't realize this first. Did anybody else notice that?

1	Since we have observed it happening in the case of the nylon bug, it cannot be the obstacle you presume :)It's easy to get lost in abstract concerns about 'information'. For instance, imagine a lock with a three-digit code, like those on briefcases. It's easy to get in if you know the code, but it's also perfectly possible to get in without knowing the code - it just takes longer. If you're right about the way information works, that oughtn't to be possible.The crucial point is that the lock contains all the information required to open it. That information is transferred to the person trying to open it via feedback: when you get the right code, the case opens. If there was no feedback - if the person was not actually opening the case themselves but was just blindly shouting numbers for someone else to try with no idea if it was working or not - they would be none the wiser.Similarly, the nylon waste products metabolised by the nylon bug intrinsically possess all the necessary information concerning how they can be broken down. That information is transferred to the bacteria via the feedback of natural selection: the bugs who hit upon the right combination survive, and those who do not, perish. In this manner information about how to survive in the present environment is transferred from the environment and encoded in the genome. No information is being created, it is merely being moved around.

We need to to ban extra efficient assault box cutters because the can open more boxes than regular boxes. We need to register all box cutters. We need to reduce the box cutter supply to prevent box cutters from getting to criminals. Regular people don't need box cutters, they can just use pointy sticks to cut tape on boxes. Did you notice. They did not use guns. Terrorist in our country used box cutters and fertilizer and U-hauls to kill people.We need to ban fertilizer and U-hauls.........

1	Support your assertion with peer-reviewed, scientific articles. Hell, you still need to support your assertion that soft bones make for "phenotypic" plasticity. Again, real scientists require evidence from research, or articles describing such evidence and research.

0	You know, your comparison of those that fought to end segregation, to those that fight to enact gun ban and gun control laws, is nothing more than a cheap and dirty tactic that does nothing to address the issue, and everything to suggest that breaking the law is alright if you're a politician or legislator.There's a very large difference between people like Rosa Parks, and the mayor of Philadelphia; gun ownership is protected by the Constitution, segregation wasn't.The fact that you're comparing those who instituted civil disobedience for good reasons, to those who want to violate state laws to pass their own laws because they think they know better and have a right to do so, just shows that you can't address the point at hand.
1	Well to be fair they do seem to have a problem distinguishing between armed and unarmed people. I recall an imigrant being shot 41 times with just some keys in his hand. Then there was the guy in the car shot while driving black.
1	It's these reasons that the Health/Wealth prosperity cults have gained in popularity. Where statements are taken out of context from the bible and applied to todays Christianity. It's why Joel Olsteens book, Your Best Life NOW and other such works are so popular.  Kingdom Now theology is quite popular and many according to current polls believe a follower is supposed to live in abundance (meaning financial things...no longer spiritual).  The Word of Faith movement (coupled with versions of Pentecostalism that accounts for about 500 million followers the world over) would be the epitomy of this scam that can't possiblly work.  Many believers also blindly defend their 'mand ob gawd's' prosperity citing that he's to get a 'double portion of honor' and have little problems when that pimp in pastors clothing lives in multi-million dollar homeS while driving several high end vehicles and being cheuffered about by armor-bearer body guards.  They miss the fact that they don't practice what they preach. Sow a seed and harvest a blessing later. That's what they extolle their followers to do. In fact, these vultures live off of their followers seed. (seed nearly always being financial).  Just recently another scandal broke out with Oral Roberts leadership in regards to these abuses.  But, if you have only an average (or less) intellect and no biblical knowledge, you could easily be duped into following these perversions of piety. They practice the most finely tuned of psychological manipulation techniques gleaned from skilled market research.  @Winston...  Even the 'widow lady had 2 coins to give'...and she did.  And you don't need money for NEEDS, like food...send that in too. Be a gooood christian.
1	Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot "raw food" dietary schemes to prevent destructive "lamarckian evolution" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats.
1	Population should decrease? Are you making another one of your anti-evolutionary statements? Populations are supposed to grow. However, the caucasian population is shrinking. You need to have 2.9 children in order to reproduce the population, but almost all of the European nations and the US arn't even producing that many. Our population is growing, but only because of hispanics.
0	but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo. An argument made for slavery was that  you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do ..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned.
1	Because homosexuals aren't attracted to members of the opposite sex, so it's pointless. In order to have a right, you have to have a legimimate way in which you can exercize that equal right. That's not possible with hetero-only marriages. There is no special right, it's equalizing it for biological concerns. Saying homosexuals can get married, but only to heterosexuals is like saying that they HAVE the right, but they have to go against their biological/mental state in order to exercize that. That's unreasonable. Of course, prior to this debate, Blacks COULD get married, but only proper marriage was between members of the same race. emoticonXRolleyes They have the same, equal rights!
0	But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.
0	funny how darwinists, when presented with evidence that lifeforms are intelligent and dynamic -- which refutes their mechanistic theory -- turn around claim it as evidence for their theory.  Go figure. I guess that's about all they can do at this point: play dumb and hope nobody notices.
1	Yes,  1) It's against Gods Law-an Abomination.  2) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help, just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like.  3) Jesus loves you and you still have a chance to have questions answered that no one in the secular world can answer.
1	And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically (read: deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with (for example) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time) in order to work.  I can't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards.
1	No it's not. There never was a Noahs ark. There was nothing to be found. The Jews ripped the story off from the Sumerian story of Gilgamesh. The bible contains nothing more than half-truths and comic-book science. If the entire Earth was covered by water as the "story" suggests, then where did all of that extra water go? Oh wait that's right, even though the Earth is a closed biosphere, according to delusional religious pawns like grizzly6626 the water must have been vacuumed up by space aliens for use on their own planet, or maybe noah snapped his fingers and it just magically disappeared. LOL emoticonXBye grizzly6626, if you were half as smart as you 'think' you are then you'd realize that if there were that much water covering the surface of the Earth then the atmosphere would have become inhabitable. Oops... guess faith and fact don't mix? LOL emoticonXGoodOnly a fool would believe what the the bible says about "Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came on the earth." Here is a more simplistic explaination. Enjoy emoticonXGood

0	Only a fool would deny the validity of Geology in legitimate science. Just as only a fool would deny the bible answers our questions in spiritual matters, such as how did we get here. But to apply Geology to a false science such as evo is to corrupt it and will no doubt be proven to result in false conclussions ln many areas of its application.  So much for this thread that was started in order to bait and mock rather than seek to learn or actually teach anything.

0	And who is keeping these drug cartels in business? Could it have anything to do with America's  insatiable demand for illegal drugs  as admitted by the US Secretary of State?   Mrs Clinton said: 'Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade.    'Our inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border to arm these criminals causes the deaths of police officers, soldiers and civilians.    'I feel very strongly we have a co-responsibility. '   She also acknowledged that US efforts to ban drugs had so far been unsuccessful in stopping the narcotics trade.    'Clearly, what we have been doing has not worked and it is unfair for our incapacity... to be creating a situation where people are holding the Mexican government and people responsible,' she said.

1	It never will. The Wild West, incidently, had a markedly lower crime rate than we have today. Potential criminals knew they could be shot by just about any passerby who witnessed their crime.
1	I think that is the most interesting part. This wasn't just a lucky find. This demonstrate the power of theory, that it is predictive. Based on a prior theoretically understanding, they hypothesized that the creature would be where it was. As the hypothesis proved correct, this further adds to the validity of the original theory.
0	And why would you say something like this? Because Christianity prohibits it? I can't think of any other reason.
0	I disagree, it depends on the nature of insult."You suck! What kind of a dumb name is 'Robbie' anyway?" Hardly requires a stretching of the old grey matter. But the snappy one-liner and the witty retort, or just a carefully crafted insult all require a fair amount of intelligence and insight.Flat out denial requires least thought. I.e. "you're wrong!", "you're wrong 'cos God says so!" "You're wrong 'cos Dawkins says so!
0	I am sure you meant "mediate" instead of "medicate" ? Or, is OSU a medical school? Or, did you know the man was off his meds? Exactly what does your rant mean other than you are so frustrated if you hear of a shooting in a Republic of over 3 million it drives you batty? How many kids drowned in 5 gallon buckets between your two posts? How many in car wrecks? How many from blunt objects or knives? Actually, death by guns is far down the list so why is it you go bananas when you hear of a shooting even if someone is killed or not? You do understand there are justifiable shootings also?

Of course the good  doctor  takes advantage of almost universal ignorance about the scientific foundations of evolution: this is a melancholy fact, and it takes the edge off the laughs I had.
0	Well nothing, other than the fact that I don't believe it to be true!

1	Unlike California, amendments in Iowa must pass the legislature first (simple majority) before going to the voters. While I know little about the Iowa legislature, this seems a no brainer in a populace vote, considering previous votes and more current polls on this subject in Iowa. As a rule I lend polls very little credence, but DOMA passed by a wide majority in 1998. I doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap, a lot of traditional values and religious folks in Iowa.
1	UK Civil Partnerships are not identical to marriage. There are a few small differences (and a heck of a lot more pages for the law books) because CPs are an entirely new entity. Most of the differences are minor, though I, and quite a few gay people in the UK, find one particularly insulting. CPs CANNOT have any religious component. Unlike heterosexual marriages which can be  completed  in a church by having someone  proclaim  them, CPs take effect upon the second signature, have no  proclamation  requirement, and cannot be  performed  in a church (though I guess nothing stops people from signing a document in a church).  It's a sop to the religious right and has quite a few religious folks angry that the government is seeking to dictate what can and cannot happen in a church.  more details:  http://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/lgbt/faq.htm  http://www.pinkweddings.biz/thelaw.htm#b  http://www.equalitycoalition.org/pressrelease.asp?ID=4  Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one.

1	A SWAT officer, a member of the  best of the best  team as far as police forces go, left a weapon behind where it could've been snatched up by any two bit criminal and used on a crime spree as people were mowed down by true automatic firepower.  Those of you who believe that only the military and police should have guns, you just got a kick in the teeth from this incident occurring. So quit ragging on private citizens who aren't  perfect  as far as you're concerned.
0	You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?
1	Just a guess on my part. But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc.  Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane. And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is.  He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims. (i.e. These cases go on for years and years and years and years. There's no closure for people.)
1	They are: those that survive better reproduce more. Members of a species can die if other members have better food/light/attention/camaflouge.
1	Of course evolutionists want to remove any possible religious connotation from evolutionary teaching. Evolution isn't science and to introduce religion has been found unconstitutional several times. And you are actually on a school board making decisions about what children are taught? How sad.
1	Well, this is not very surprising coming from Brownback. I live in Kansas City Missouri, but work over on the Kansas side, so I know plenty about Brownback. He's been quite a bastard toward gay related issues over the years, and I think the same goes for abortion in his case. If he's the Republican nominee for the presidential election, boy am I voting Democrat just on that principle, not to mention the fact I haven't voted Republican since George W. You know, maybe they should question judges that have attended hetero marriages as to their impartiality as well as those who attend churches that vocally state their anti-gay views. emoticonXAngelEDIT: Yep, just checked, and he IS strongly pro-life, having referred to the amount of abortions in the United States since Roe V. Wade as "a holocaust", and is also one of the Kansas officials in favor of teaching Intelligent Design alongside Evolution. He also opposes stem cell research.
1	Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is  settled law  and the subsequent power to make it so?  I didn't think so.
0	As firearms sales in the United States hit new highs, the Obama Administration and Democrats in Congress are squelching talk of a renewal of the assault weapons ban passed by Congress that lapsed in 2004, saying they don't want a distraction from their agenda and don't have the votes in Congress.  Seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since November in an effort to buy guns, according to the FBI. That figure doesn't include Virginia, whose gun shows don't require any background checks.  The buying bonanza has stripped some stores almost bare of assault weapons and yielded a national ammunition shortage.  As gun sales blossom, Democrats' interest in regulating gun sales appear to be waning, despite the recent spate of high-profile gun violence.  Two recent reports have fingered the Obama Administration and the assault weapons ban's most ardent supporter in Congress -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) -- as putting off any effort to regulate high-powered weapons. Congressional officials told a reporter in comments published Saturday that Obama and top White House aides have all but abandoned a push for tighter gun control, indicating they can't stomach a fight with the National Rifle Association when they're focused on other issues.   He and other White House strategists have decided they can't afford to tangle with the National Rifle Association at a time when they're pushing other priorities, like economic renewal and health-care reform,  congressional officials said.

0	Well isn't the beilef commonly held that women will be damned if they commit abortion unless they repent? I think that veiw is primarily the one doing the demoniaing isn't it?  -  I may be going to hell in a bucket....  But at least I stand up for what I believe.
1	Actually it is more than that. Yes conservatives will be back in power, but I have never seen so much discontent in America period.  I don't know where we got off track but I think it is this. We are Americans, not Democrat or Republican. Our allegiance belongs to the Republic, not to any political group. While we fight and try to score some kind of political points with each and every event, America is burning. Sooner or later, while we bicker endlessly, the American People are going to be fed up with both parties, and move into something yet not discovered.  Heck, the way China is rising in material wealth, and while we mortgage our Children's futures so that we do not have to feel the pain, maybe we will be just presiding over the destruction of the greatest society even known to man.  All of this is possible unless we find the courage to work together for the good of all America, instead of just trying to play got ya with the other party.  It is what I said a few days ago. United we Stand and Divided We Fall!  However, I doubt the Chinese will be anywhere as benevolent as We the People were. But it seems clear that change is coming, but I sincerely doubt that is has very little to do with the kind of change Obama Envisioned!  So belly up to the bar and Get Some discontent Boys! After all we all have earned it!  We reap what we sow!
0	You just don't get it. Americans are freemen. Your faith in governments over people is humorous... How does it fell to lick the bootheels of your government overlords..... Rights are inalienable to man. One man has NO right to intefere with another man. I should be able to do as I please as long as I do not intefere with others... How does your government feel about that?
1	The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.

1	Theories change since they are just that - theories. Once time and sufficient investigation has given them sufficient weight, they become laws. Newton's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences (we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light) and for that regime, they remain true. Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers. Now, it’s the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human's experience.

0	No... you're not entirely correct. You can be skeptical all you want, but the empirical evidence is overwhelming for a world wide flood, a global cataclysm... as I stated earlier, you're not even taken seriously even in the secualar world of  science  if you try to refute the flood record, the flood is solid and is not privy to question. Enoch built the first pyramids, and his were superior in quality to he knock-offs of later days. The flood has been dated to have occured about 4400 to 4600 B.C.

0	But most creationists are YECs. The word has taken on bad connotations so it sounds a bit sour to call a theistic evolutionist a "creationist." The most usual use of the word is as the name of someone who believes that the Bible is literal, including creation in 6 days, Adam and Eve in a magic garden, and a global flood. Someone who relieves in God but recognizes that much of the Bible is composed of moral tales and the mythology of the ancient Hebrews isn't really a "creationist." I guess we could run down the list of degrees of creationism from flat earth to theistic evolution if you want.

0	 Lottery ? I hope you don't mean that it is completely random in all cases...  Note: did you notice that this was the position you were arguing against in the previous sentence?
1	Not necessarily. When "life" begins is irrelevant, because flowers and weeds don't have rights yet they are a life form. The thing that determines rights is intelligence. Not how much or how little, but whether someone has it at all. A spec of dirt has no intelligence. It won't pop up and say "hey! How ya doin!" unless you're on crack. We've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy. We hunt, and we go to war. Even though I do not agree with war, I do agree with hunting, and I myself hunt on occasion. However, that is off topic. The point is, carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects, and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life. Its awful how she will have to liver her life. If she gets an abortion, the embryo does not (to quote another opinion) "mentally exist". Now, hunting is really only done for recreation, and maybe a good meal. They would've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell. Sure, they'd prefer hunting, but its really only done for fun and exercise. I, myself, value an animal over an embryo at its current stage. The only reason I don't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human. Then again, the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness, and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs.
0	Yes - drug use is another arena where you, the morality police and big brother can also bugger off.  And just like people smoke doobies despite their being illegal - you can bet your XXX I will have an abortion if I (me, myself, I - not you, Bush the horse or da Pope) determine it is detrimental to myself and whatever laws you have passed to increase your comfort level and the illusion that you have actually doen anything to help (a sad misconception) be damned.  You are missing the point of my using the quote. It is not an excuse for any kind of behavior. It is me, telling you, and anyone else who cares to meddle in my private affairs that they are not welcome there and I will not be taking into consideration for one second what any of you think.
1	And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society.

0	A woman can think was she wants but it is still a human being. Killing parasites was often the argument for eugenics ya know...a parasite on society...just thought I'd let that slip.Nevertheless, I think the woman should have the choice..and she does. However, if she makes the choice to kill another human being we should punish her or whoever did it.
1	It used to be thought that it was God who caused earthquakes or floods. Now, we know that earthquakes are caused by the movement of continental plates that are under stress. Floods are caused by a variety of reasons - too much rain floods rivers, a previously confined body of water bursts its bank once those banks eventually degrade, etc. Diseases used to be ascribed to God and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety. Now we know that diseases strike indiscriminately (where piety is concerned) and affect people only based on their risk of acquiring the virus and their general state of health. There are many other examples.
1	You actually can vote on this (of have your legislatures do it). Some issues require more than just a majority but you can still vote. If 80% of the people think all Jewish persons should live in Florida then its not looking for those Jewish persons that don't wish to live in Florida. This doesn't mean its the right thing to do but this is a flaw of democracy.
1	HERE! HERE!  This is the core of the argument.... Liberty or prohibition.... Government Schools, Liberal Media, liberals all try to paint this picture of dependancy that unfortunatly have taken root. Freemen of this world know that there is only one option and that is liberty. Liberty minded individuals believe in the capabilities of men and women to be self-responsible, self reliant, self-dependant.  Who's the Boss of you?
1	Well then, using just the Bible, what is the value of pi to the third decimal point?
1	Simply put, the only way gun control could work is if all guns were destroyed and none ever made again.  Murder, robbery, and rape would still happen- people would just use other weapons.  Not only that, but guns level the playing field. A criminal is not going to pull out a gun and mug someone if he knows the other guy is armed.  A good example is britian- after there gun ban went into effect general crime rates rose about 200%.
1	And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
1	You're missing the point. The ghetto resistance was drastically outmanned and outgunned, and it still took the professional, well armed German military, nearly a month to beat them down into defeat.
1	Incorrect. Following proper firearm safety procedures will reduce accidents to effectively zero.
0	So what do you think about the fact that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of those who are aborted?  While this baby 21 week baby is living in one hospital room, down the hall a 22/23/24/25/26 ect week baby is being aborted because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1	I'll address the later question. They may not  need  teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't  useful , they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case.
1	I think it would be an exception as well.  But if you see an indicator that might point to an  exception , I think the question should be asked.  Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.  If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?  Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question.
1	Then why are you a Global Warming Advocate Jo? Since you just produced evidence that over the last 150 years, throughout the complete Industrial Revolution since fossil fuels have been being burned, the Atmospheric Co2 levels worldwide have only gone up by 100 ppm?http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedi...on_Dioxide.pngAre you forgetting that the Earth's atmosphere has the ability to constantly clean itself, so once we get third world industrialized countries throughout Asia and Africa to adopt clean air policies, world wide air pollution will become a distant memory in no time at all? Also, your stats in addition to these stats http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/pr...te_crisis.html prove that the threat of Global Warming is a myth.
1	I'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities. Especially the Deistic Gods. And I'd love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic, reason or any laws. What science can do is disprove that God was directly responsible for this or that, the sun rising, the rain season, etc. Did you perhaps realize that many scientists are Buddhists because Buddhism which has beings that behave as Gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural? Or are you again assuming all religions don't exist except for Christanity? 
1	No they are'nt. DNA of gametes is haploid, where as the stomatic cells of the mother and father are diploid. Also, egg and sperm DNA is jumbled, meaning it genes are swapped along chromsosomes, resulting in very different combinations then exist in the original stomatic cells. No, you're wrong, the DNA of the egg and father have many of the same genes as the mother and father, but lack 1/2 of the same genes as well as the same placement.

1	Our definition of omniscient does not include virtual. That tells me that omniscient means having infinite knowledge.
1	First of all why would you want to know if I have an alternative theory to one that is known to be false ? Are you found of false theories?  A true theory would be a replacement not an alternative.  The Wrong Answer Will Always Be The Wrong Answer!  If evolution was true there would be overwhelming , uncontestable evidence, there is no uncontestable evidence. Little that is any more than pure imagination.  Theories start out as hypothesis and are then subject to experimentation and observation. When they fail they are discarded. For instance spontaneous generation was disproved by Pasteur and discarded as a theory.  Evolution which is not a theory ,although it is called one ,has been falsified nine ways to Sunday. Two of Darwin's own falsifications have come to pass and ignored. The Galopagos Finches have proven to interbreed which destoys a great deal of the so called basis of his theory.  Extinct  animals and plants are found alive and ignored as evidence against evolution. Theories are made to be challenged but evidence against evolution is suppressed.  Evolutionist had to revive spontaneous generation although it is scientifically impossible because without it atheism is impossible. The atheist must have a story no matter how bizzare to justify his faith . Science suffers because of this.  My theory is that this planet is exactly what Einstein said it was , a place designed by a Supreme Being to be inhabited by people.  The evidence is creation itself. If there is a creation there must be a Creator.  Nothing has ever been observed to self assemble and there is no known process that could accomplish that.  Animals and plants just like the ones alive today have always existed. Many have gone extinct but death is not evidence of evolution.  Human beings are incapable of creating a grain of sand from nothing.  There are grains of sand so there is an intelligence greator than ours that did.  The perfect balance seen in the anthropic principle tells of a Creator.  The unbelievable complexity of the human body makes evolution impossible.  DNA can not exist without proteins. Proteins are coded by the information in the DNA molecule. They had to come into being simultaneously.  Pre-biotic natural selection is impossible , there is no process to affect the evolution of DNA outside of a living organism.  To look at a building is to have absolute empirical proof there was a builder.  To look at creation and say there was no Creator is to enter an intellectually free zone.
1	Exactly and if you accept that animals have been on the Earth for millions of years then why can't evolution be a process that God created and controls?

1	I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.
0	Oh, so God's design prowess is comparable to that of we mere humans? He's no more intelligent than us? I thought God was supposed to be all knowing, but I guess you've just shown that to not be the case.You also miss the fact that we KNOW FOR A FACT that internal combustion engines are designed by humans, and that we KNOW FOR A FACT that they could not arise without us. On the other hand, we do NOT KNOW that humans were designed by God and we do NOT KNOW that humans could not arise without Him. In fact, we have considerable evidence to the contrary: that humans evolved from a common ancestor we share with chimps. Engines don't reproduce; life does. Engines don't undergo biological evolution; life does.Your analogy is flawed, in multiple ways.
0	I don't disagree but since we've prohibited felons from buying firearms(new ones anyway), we have created the NICS system.  Why wouldn't we want to apply it to all transactions?
1	But most creationists think that it is OK to force their views on everyone by requiring creationism, their religion, to be taught in school. Actually, the public schools have the obligation to teach current science - the best answers that we have today. Today, the United States ranks near the bottom in the knowledge of science and math of graduating secondary school children. Only in our universities do we begin to do the job. But check out the number of foreign teachers we have in our universities. We are doing such a bad job that we have to go elsewhere to find adequately trained individuals.
1	Almost all textbooks on evolution include the peppered moth as the classic example of evolution by natural selection.http://www.clcoc.org/news/peppered.htm"The peppered moth, Biston betularia (L.), is one of some 20,000 moth species found in the United Kingdom. It became a famous example of evolution by means of natural selection. after the Industrial Revolution. The typica variety of the moth is white with black speckles and is a striking lichen mimic."http://wiki.cotch.net/wiki.phtml?title=Peppered_mothFor years the story of the peppered moth, Biston betularia, has provided one of the best-known examples of natural selection in action.http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.htmlAlthough I failed High School biology I do remember that the peppered moth was given to us as an example of evolution at work. And it didn't show anything about the frequency of genotypes, because the population has been producing the same moths. If all you can show that a moth population changes colour, then again, then back again how is this anything remotely like evolution?It is still being taught...http://www.bethtfiloh.com/biology9pepperedmoth.htmBut it doesn't explain much."Most biologists, however, believe that natural selection is responsible, though no one knows what traits are being selected or what factors in the environment are doing the selecting."http://www.arn.org/docs/wells/jw_pepmoth.htmAnother look into this is given at...http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/moonshine.htmAll that has been observed is that the population changed colour. They don't even know why. Despite this, misleading statements such as ..."The peppered moth (Biston betularia (L.)) is a temperate species of night-flying moth notable for its evolution of industrial melanism."http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Peppered-mothare continually spread. (http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html) Cited above argues quite well that we still don't know why - all an evolutionist can say is 'it happened', and 'it happened by evolution'.It is akin to Darwin giving examples of 'natural selection' by referring to how man breeds animals. In other words, his evidences for natural selection comes from non-natural, purpose driven selection.Darwin said "There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. In the survival of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of Selection."http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/Origin/origin_15.htmlThe phrase 'survival of the fittest' was not even Darwin's. It was urged on him by Wallace, the codiscoverer of natural selection, who hated 'natural selection' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting. Darwin coined the term 'natural selection' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection' as done by breeders, an analogy Wallace hadn't made when he developed his version of the theory. The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was originally due to Herbert Spencer some years before the Originhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.htmlAnd this sort of thing continues today in modern textbooks."From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled "Darwin's Mistakes," by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is."Robert H Tamarin, (1996) "Principles of Genetics" (5th ed), p571.

1	"4 JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes us for discussing the prologue last. Post,at 8. But if a prologue can be used only to clarify an ambiguous operativeprovision, surely the first step must be to determine whether theoperative provision is ambiguous. It might be argued, we suppose, thatthe prologue itself should be one of the factors that go into the determinationof whether the operative provision is ambiguous—but thatwould cause the prologue to be used to produce ambiguity rather thanjust to resolve it. In any event, even if we considered the prologuealong with the operative provision we would reach the same result wedo today, since (as we explain) our interpretation of “the right of thepeople to keep and bear arms” furthers the purpose of an effectivemilitia no less than (indeed, more than) the dissent’s interpretation.See infra, at 26–27.5 JUSTICE STEVENS is of course correct, post, at 10, that the right toassemble cannot be exercised alone, but it is still an individual right,and not one conditioned upon membership in some defined “assembly,”as he contends the right to bear arms is conditioned upon membership in a defined militia. And JUSTICE STEVENS is dead wrong to think thatthe right to petition is “primarily collective in nature.” Ibid. SeeMcDonald v. Smith, 472 U.

1	Actually, no, my understanding is that in most states the law doesn't require this at all. Many doctors take what is known as the Hipocratic oath, but it's not a legally binding oath. Doctors may be subject to personal lawsuits, but that's not the same thing.  Also, the fact the church you mentioned owns a  beachside pavillion  has nothing to do with much of anything. If the church truly owns it, they can refuse any ceremony they want. That it has been  open to all for years  carries no weight whatsoever. It is church property--which is essentially the same as a church saying it doesn't want gay ceremonies in its sanctuary which churches are free to refuse. Maybe churches are imposed upon in such ways in Canada, but not in the US.  Given these matters, I'm not sure the HRC is being any more honest than the video they are responding to.
1	This is obviously incorrect since Earth and Mars are were created only 6,000 years ago. And how did they know that Mars would be so close this year?I have other questions too. How do they know that Pluto has a 249 year orbit of the sun since it wasn't discovered until 1930. No one has seen it orbit the sun yet. How did they know that it would actually come closer to the sun than Neptune in 1979 and move forther away again in 1999? They told me that when I was young. But no one had ever seen it. It was just speculation - a scientific theory, right?? ;) :p

Heterosexuals have no more business doing these things then homosexuals.  Do you realise Steve that E Coli bacteria inhabit the rectum and are in feces? Do you know how sick and E Coli infection can make you? Sodomy is akin to having sex in raw sewage.

1	I believe it to be the case that marriage existed prior to any legal recognition of the relationship. If this is true, it seems reasonable to conclude that the state, for whatever reasons, wanted to encourage that particular relationship. Now, if it did so in order to foster an atmosphere where family life can best be nurtured and brought to maturity, that's well and good. But I still disagree with your conclusion that "there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders." As a general proposition, I agree with this. Two individuals can certainly build a life together without any encouragement from the state. However, in a strict legal sense, there certainly are requirements one must fulfill in order to receive the benefits the state wishes to confer. In other words, legislatures have determined not only that they want to foster and encourage an atmosphere conducive for family life, they have determined that the best way to accomplish this is by encouraging the relationship to be between two individuals of the opposite sex.Now, I will probably say this more than once so that I ensure it has been taken into account: my primary purpose in starting this thread (and my other posts) is not WHETHER the definition of marriage should be changed, but if it is to be changed, WHO should change it.
1	Actually, Darwin didn't like the phrase "survival of the fittest" applied to his theory. The phrase was actually coined by sociologist Herbert Spencer in the statement of his social theories. Darwin's preferred phrase was "natural selection" and used the phrase "survival of the fittest" only after it had become popular and Alfred Wallace (a Christian turned spiritualist) convinced Darwin that he would avoid confusion by using it. If one wants to reduce the hundreds of pages of theory that Darwin wrote to a single sound bite, "differential reproductive success" is probably the best. Further, natural selection was a proposed mechanism to explain the observed divergence of species.Darwin was quite aware of the implications of his theory for mankind from the beginning. He was also aware that it would be unpopular with the Church and the religious so he didn't mention it in On the Origin of Species. He waited until the theories expressed in that book had become generally accepted in the scientific community and then published The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. In the later book Darwin did argue that mankind shared a common ancestor with apes.

1	What do you mean "my ultimate agenda"? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore "well regulate." Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, " 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia." Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that "The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia." Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.
0	Hetero or not is irrelevant.  Society over the millenia has set up the institution of marriage which set up as being between people of opposite genders.  You are of course entitled to persuade people to change the concept.

1	I watched the program and managed to keep the television switched on despite the distractions from irrelevant images, loud hymn singing, and the editing of Dawkins' contribution - which made him look like a 'mad scientist'.  The claim that Intelligent Design is a novel idea sprung full-armed from the heads of American religious enthusiasts is wrong. What is now loosely called the 'design argument' has been known to philosophers for at least two centuries as an a posteriori argument (literally, 'from backwards'). It is examined at length and dismissed by Hume in his 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion' published in 1779.

In addition, you never asked for a dollar amount in your challenge for evidence, you asked for evidence that gay churches were involved in political activism.

We are tired of the closet. The phrase "we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing.
1	No you didn't. All you did was spam your same argument your originally made. Notice that as the same argument I pointed out results in a liar God. A god that made the universe very different from the universe we see today and hid all of the operating physical laws that were different along with all of the evidence. As your own link cites, your argument requires God to have given a fictious history, either in the Bible or the the natural world.  Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term  light year.   If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism.  I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar.  On the contrary, I did just that. Under your argument, the conclusion is God is a liar.   So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace.   God does that not make God an epic liar?  lol. Good luck proving that. You don't even understand your original argument.

And if we look at the fluid mechanics thread, you are trying to jump on the issue that the failure to provide 100% certainty of expected layers makes TOE wrong yet you provide no evidence of your beliefs.

1	It isn't a fraud. Why would you say that? And it isn't evidence for evolution, it is an observation of evolution. The allele frequency of the moths changed (twice) over time. The most reasonable explanation seems to be that it was the result of natural selection. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution.
1	Your faulty logic is easy to spot:  Your only looking at the 26 decided cases listed by the VPC, 2 being slightly more than 92% of 26. But, your making the absurd assumption that the VPC listed all the aquitted or dismissed cases. Why would they? They were compiling a list of CCW murderers. It's far more likely they were screening out the dismissed and aquitted cases and missed these two.  Your 92% figure is lacking a solid basis and cannot be used to predict the outcome of the 49 pending cases.
1	Well it's a bit more than that....there's the issue of bad fats too...ie omega 6 fats. Ever notice how the Omega 3s in Salmon and flaxseed oil are pushed? ....you know why? Because Omega 3 oils, among other things, have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body.Why is it so hard to believe that if a diet that's high in sugar leads to inflammatory diseases, that a reduction or elimination of sugar would eliminate or drastically reduce those symptoms?I'm actually speaking from experience. I didn't dream this stuff up. I've lived it. I used to have a condition called chronic prostatitis...which is an inflammation of the prostate that often happens in young men. This is not a medically curable condition. Doctors often throw antibiotics at it, but most men don't respond to that. As a result there are thousands of men around the country who live in constant, chronic debilitating pain. I used to be one of them. But no longer. I learned the secret, which is to eliminate junk foods and sugars. After just a couple weeks of doing this my constant pain just seemed to evaporate. I have never looked back. Have you ever noticed how some people seem to always be hot, while some are cold? Some people are just hot natured. Many times older people are cold natured. Do you know why? It's from caloric intake. The more calories one consumes, the hotter the oven gets in your body. Calories are just measurements of heat. heat corresponds with inflammation...inflammation is the source of the problem.
0	That doesn't teach (here is the topic braille) student athletes anything, it is discrimination and violation of their 2A rights.  Drugs are just a strawman. Strike three!
0	What a joke. You're going to attempt to tell me, with a straight face, that cops don't look out for their fellow cops? Sorry, NO SALE. emoticon_rolleyes
1	so do you think the Soviets, er -- silly me -- I mean Darwinists, will put 2 + 2 together and proclaim to the world that since one's environment (diet, environmental toxins, etc) can cause disease that one could eliminate/control this disease by eliminating the environmental source that's causing it?  I think this would explain why cancer is getting to be so wide-spread in society and why younger and younger people are developing it. The cause of disease has nothing to do with the genes themselves...as Dr. Bruce Lipton says,  It's the environment, stupid.  Of course if this little secret got out (that people could cure themselves by changing their internal and/or external environments) then Big medicine, including millions and millions of people would be without a paycheck. We can't have that. The sad thing though, as your article indicates, is disease doesn't just end with the person who has it...diseases often get carried forward into future generations, making children (and their children) more vulnerable.
0	Well, if my points in this thread are so easy to refute then why do you focus on addressing arguments made in another thread? I'm not fooled by anyone who claims to have a winning hand but won't show others his cards.
0	Translation: Anti-abortionist intellectuals aren't really opposed to abortion as an end in itself, they only oppose abortion because they believe forcing women to remain pregnant is an appropriate punishment for their True Sin, sex outside of marriage.The goal isn't to "prevent murder" at all, this is merely a convenient excuse to punish women who stray from traditional relationships.That's why those opposed to abortion are also opposed to contraception, even though contraception prevents abortion.So the fact that abortion protestors also prevent people from accessing contraception isn't contradictory at all, it is completely in line with their goals.
1	The wikipedia reference has recorded data from:"The Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) is an atmospheric baseline station on Mauna Loa volcano, on the big island of Hawaii. Since 1957 MLO has been continuously monitoring and collecting data relating to atmospheric change, and is known especially for their continuous monitoring of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, which is sometimes referred to as the Keeling Curve. The observatory is under the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)."Could it possibly be that we should be considering an increased activity of the volcano? Are we interpreting what we observe erroneously?
1	Well, criticism of your opinions isn't hard to find here. What is interesting is that you rarely have anything substantial against those criticisms. After all, you said that bees cannot fly, tv show props are good evidence of creationism, and that oil is not a hydrocarbon.  Your opinion does not count for much given its consistent history of massive and epic levels of incorrectness.  Interesting how you think that because we arouse through natural processes we don't have any more value than anything else that arouse through natural processes. Sterile sand is natural. So is uranium. Tell me, which is more valuable?
1	Agreed! emoticon_xhoho
1	And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.
0	Ahh. Now I see why you turned into an agnostic, if you even believed Christianity in the first place.
1	My post #1, combined with what unkerpaulie copy/pasted from my deleted post, makes my position clear enough. If anyone else shows an interest, we'll go from there. We'll give it one month....11-31-09. If no one bites by then, you can just delete this whole thread, Mr moderator. I'll then decide if I start this in the creo/evo forum here, or if I take it to the EvC forums.
0	Just another one of Chuzlife's overgeneralizing personal attacks. Along with child molester, mass murderer, ad nauseum ...  Chuzlife may not need God, but he needs the good guys and the bad guys in his worldview.
1	No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.
1	Anti-gunners. Why do you HATE our Constitutions Bill of Rights? Why do you persecute people who can pass a background check not only once, but every time they purchase a new gun? You told America that this would satisfy you, when this new law was proposed! But NO! You demonize us anyway! We prove our lawfulness not only when we purchase a new gun, but also CCW people have to pass another background check when they apply for a Concealed Handgun License, then take a test and classes to boot?  We already have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws.  When are you going to be reasonable?So what's the deal? Why do you HATE America so much? Why do you HATE us law-abiding people who keep our noses clean all of our lives? Heck, I am 62 and have never run afoul of our laws. Do you think we are going to start now? Descent and public discourse is fine, but I surely hope you folks are not planning violence against our Great and Unique Country! You often sound like it is possible when you complain incessantly about our Constitution, our Rights and the laws of this nation governing the peaceful use and ownership of firearms.
0	Is it only religious people who insite violence and hatred toward gays? NO!  You're attempting, weakly at that, to jump on the Frist-train by saying hes persecuting religious people. As if religious people are being singled out.
0	Well that was a lovely story and cudos on working in the anti-war angle. emoticon_rolleyes   No, the 50 or more GIANT posters in a row alongside a public (taxpayer funded) roadway do not affect me personaly in any way from a shock perspective. As I said
1	It seems in this case they used termination to get rid of dna evidence therefore allowing the stepfather to carry on abusing his step daughter.  The mother should be charged with destroying police evidence and accessory to the crime.
0	And there it is again (twice in this post). Why do you keep equating christianity with YEC? No one is denying that christians can do geology or any other science. YEC's on the other hand, would be incapable.
1	Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis &amp; Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine).
1	actually, human skin is sensitive to light, not to mention nearly all plants are sensitive to light. light sensitive cells are abundant even where there are no eyes. just a tiny bit of reading and youll realise that they didnt  magically  appear.
1	Million year old moths didn't have the same capabilities as a present day moths. Million year old moths had capabilities that suited it to the million year old environment. Changes to moths have been subtle because it is a successful group of organisms, but changes do exist. Also, you keep harking on brains making creatures adaptive. An ant has a brain, yet an ant follows a very predictable program that can be quite easily simulated by computers. Of course there is always a randomizaion factor, but you mustn't confuse random action with adaptation.
1	Yes I do, but because of time restraints and for lack of a better example that everyone could relate to and understand I used it. There are plenty of good examples of where people believe one thing was true while - infact - something else was true, so the point still stands. A better example (that I probably should have used instead) is that people used to believe that the Earth was the center of the universe, etc. etc. :)
1	Sigh, we have been through this a million times...the term is defined, doctors testified to it, so yeah it exits.
1	Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.
0	Well, the funny thing is... if he's so public about his plans and even if he succeeds a little, the SEC will probably come in and bankrupt he and his flock and ruin the rest of their lives. He probably would end up facing a fair amount of jail time. Stock manipulation is illegal. And a giant like Microsoft will be out for blood. His being so vocal about it is probably the dumbest thing he could do. This guy is not playing with a very bright bulb.And, yes, you'd think that he'd be pouring all his energy into feeding the poor, helping New Orleans recover from Hurricane George. Some of these christian folk have their priorities so twisted it makes me sick.
0	Do you see cops driving down the road, going over the speed limit, turning on their lights during rush hour to get to their exit which is just a little ways ahead and then turn their lights off after they exit the highway. People who enforce the law think that they are better than the law, and don't have follow the law, even if they enforce the law, or make them, i personally think that is Bull****!!!
1	So, if there was a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort?
1	It has nothing to do with "evolutionists" and "creationists". Some people are confused about relativity theory. According to relativity, the speed of light is constant, so a lightyear is a constant. The speed of light is unaffected by any changes in the observer's time frame caused by gravity or speed. Regardless of whether we sit in a black hole, a white hole, a bounded universe or an unbounded one, if light from a star has taken 10 billion years to reach us, then the universe is at least 10 billion years old.
1	Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.  See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
1	Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion. In typical fashion you make claims which you don't support at all. Here is my post below, point out WITH EVIDENCE!!! what I am distorting in any way; especially that which I hold dear. In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno

0	A long time ago, a simple experiment was proposed to supersport. This experiment could easily convince an observer of the validity of his viewpoint. All supersport has to do is tag some Biston betularia such that they can be identified individually, and move typica morphs to polluted areas and carbonaria to cleaner areas. If any individual changes form, supersport would be vindicated.  supersport has been ignoring this proposal since its introduction.

1	Quote:  We were all first term fetuses in the beginning. So, if your mother aborted you in the first term it would be fine, according to you. If she aborted you in the third term, then its wrong, according to you. well either way you would have been killed and wouldn't be here. Thats my point.
1	Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools. We have to more and more, as atheism is established.
1	Only a fool could believe that getting rid of contraceptives, and other forms of prevention and education will reduce the abortion rate!!
0	Try posting a thread on that subject then, rather than trying to obtain your information by deception.  You can also find statistics related to your question at religioustolerance.org.
1	Perhaps it was an allegorical/metaphorical reference to abiogenesis that creationists just haven't understood.
0	I dunno. What is the scoop here? You complain about the responses we give, and yet you keep coming back for more. Even people with down syndrome learn enough to only stick their hands in the open flame once.
0	Your question, which has been pointed out already, has a theological basis - God is supposed to have given us dominion over the rest of creation etc. But what separates us from other mammals (if we restrict the question to that class of vertebrates) is reckoned to be  self consciousness  - the human mind that can deliberate upon and analyse its own thought processes.
1	So there are "ancient extinct reptiles" to you?These things indeed existed on Earth right?In the creationist framework, when were these things on the Earth?5000 years ago?Before the flood, after the flood?Did Noah have dinosaurs (sorry, ancient extinct reptiles) on the ark?
0	Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.
1	Sure. This is the "norm" that we have. But really, these rules are open to change by either of you. You should decide how you want to be "judged". Since this is a formal debate - one should stay clear of all the classical logical fallacies. They actually contain the majority of rules and guidelines for a successful argument. A decent list of them is compiled here:http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.htmlUsing proper English and capitalization is just another novelty of formal debate. Although I personally think that it strengthens one's argument - I'm quite sure that the content speaks for itself. Insults and personal attacks should have no place in debate. It is always possible to separate one from their argument. Attack the argument and not the person. Again - that is just one of the logical fallacies.As for advice and other guidelines of a strong argument, I strongly suggest this website:http://www.kings.edu/debate/Judges/N...ternhagen.htmlIt gives general tips and the like for debates.Also, regarding length. Length of posts is often required and over-simplifying can be a great error. The other extreme - over-complicating will not add much to debate. Once the debate is over (you decide how many posts each) then I could, if you want, outline a winner and provide my reasons for thinking so.

1	Ever hear of something called  the missing link ? That's Darwin.  It's been upgraded from theory to a law a long time before you were born, as far as I'm aware. It's hasn't been a theory for a long time. Things are a theory until enough scientists reproduce the same results repeatedly. Then it becomes a law  And how exactly was that done and why do only you know this?
1	Fish to Amphibian supporting evidence frmo here:Fish/Amphibian Transition from primitive bony fish to amphibians: Paleoniscoids again (e.g. Cheirolepis) Osteolepis -- one of the earliest crossopterygian lobe-finned fishes, still sharing some characters with the lungfish (the other group of lobe-finned fish). Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones, and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth. Eusthenopteron (and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian-like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet. Icthyostegids (such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron's fish features (e.g., the fin rays of the tail were retained). Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian; it is an excellent transitional fossil. Labyrinthodonts (e.g., Pholidogaster, Pteroplax) -- still have some icthyostegid features, but have lost many of the fish features (e.g., the fin rays are gone, vertebrae are stronger and interlocking, the nasal passage for air intake is well defined.) And while nothing is ever proven 100% in science, the link between fish and amphibians is pretty conclusive. Evidence for dino to bird evolution just keeps mounting and at present it is the best supported theory. Just look at the recent discovery of an oviraptorosaurian dinosaur with 2 eggs still in it's body, two very bird like eggs.....See here:dinoeggs So once again, while not proven 100%, dino to bird evolution is the best supported theory. Do you have anything that is better supported???

1	Actually, I had heard it several times on radio talk shows that normally do research before making claims. I then read it on several sites that cited the U.S. Census Records as their source. Since the radio shows and the websites all credited the U.S.Census, I perceived that they could not have made it up...since they all matched within acceptable tolerances. It does seem reasonable to you that such information could be gleaned from the census data...does it not?Will you agree that what they say is true?
0	The point is you dancing in the blood, of at least one innocent. Why else post this? Especially with no comment?

1	The first article is from 2002 and the second one is from 2006, molecular genetics changed massively over that period of time with the completition of the human genome project and the development of new technology. What they would be looking at and comparing would have changed drastically as well, from just the genes in the first case (the 99% figure) and everything in the second (94%).
0	Your idea of responsibilities is twisted. Why should anyone other than the criminals, be required to pay a tax for the actions of criminals?  By your logic the public should be paying fines that the media outlet would face for lying.
1	Yes but as you know some breasts resemble some sponges its not too big a jump to get from one to the other and of course there are other spongy tissues derived in the same way. This was all published as an appendix to the Book of Official Rules which is an addendum to The One True Book of the Round Church of which I am the hereditary pope. However I have lent my copy out and its not available on the web.
1	Ah ha! Someone who understands the application of information theory to biological organisms. By the biological specific definition of information, the genome of any organism is information about the environment in which it lives.
1	First off, define "government funded". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed. The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government.
1	See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in.
0	Mongoloid? Is this 1937?
1	Well, to keep it short, I’ll cite you to what I think are two of the best expressions of why the RKBA exists. The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher, whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America. The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749). The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300There are many solid legal, moral, and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership. Some are short, but many are long. I know quite a few of them, and I’ll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate. Just let me know here.---False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen. M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen. John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms. V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 35, 4th ed., p. 286. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. Joseph Stalin, Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee, Dec. 7, 1927. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, p. 378. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601..The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country. Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.
1	I see you're right there. The trends here cannot be simply based on the number of searches because every trend would be climbing in that case as more and more people own computers.I think the trend at any one point is calculated something like this - (volume of trend search at given point / total search volume at given point ) Here another way to compare side by side -http://www.google.com/trends?q=Chris...ate=all&sort=0
1	This quote also shows that the supposed "friends" were women who lived in the same complex as the woman, not necessarily anything more than neighbors. Flynt also tried to get the media to pick up his story but instead they insisted as told by Ward:
0	That's not what he said. Why do you find it necessary to lie? But of course, you are quoting a news story. I have had experience with news stories that purport to quote what someone has said.
1	Well do you mean Texas or Texans? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US. Not something I'd be proud of.
1	Mmmmm, not necessarily. Many of the arguments of against gods (those with specific properties, not just a general diety) deal with incompatible traits, like a square circle has. One does not have to search the universe to know square circles do not exist.  People state simple negatives all the time. The lack of evidence for the positive makes them reasonable.
1	Thou shalt not commit adultery. I'm to lazy to look for anyone dealing with premaritial sex. Adultery and premaritial sex are sin, because God says not to participate in them.
1	Did you actually read your own links? I was holding those in reserve to prove my comment. Interesting reading non? It seems the wars are repetitious and always involve a tyrant and his government and other wanna be's like Vichy in France capitulating with Hitler. Most of the Free Army was composed of whom? When did the resistance begin and are you making the argument that "resistance is futile" or that resistance is effective?No doubt Sarge will have some insight on the sitop also?
1	So you're saying evolution never enters politics, and Creationists never consider science?
0	It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.
0	That right there is pretty much what some cops, mainly in the big cities like LA do. They make up stuff. They lie to make themselves look good and throw someone in jail. I'm not making this up. Then they go to the DA and bring up bogus charges on weapons that are 100% legal. Since the DA wants to look like he/she is doing something they don't pass it up. This is what guns laws do ladies and gentlemen. They victimize the innocent and let go of the bad ones.
1	Really? The Republicans have just discovered that 80% of hip replacements are done through Medicare and that the waiting time is much shorter than in Canada.
1	The only arguement I hear from these links against embryonic stem cell research is that, in ten years, it hasn't yielded sufficient results for human trials. If that is your only arguement against its scientific viability then it is a weak one. Many technologies, biological ones included, can take a long time to develop. Certainly, the adult repair stem cells that are mentioned in your articles may have their uses and sound as if they also deserve research money. However, one cannot just listen to one side of the story to make a decision. The scientists researching repair stem cells, patients who benefited from them, and doctors who use them are obviously going to sing its praises when it does introduce some gain. However, the embryonic stem cells might have even more potential, given the time and money to develop the technology.So, unless you can show me evidence that embryonic stem cells will never achieve their potential or that repair stem cells can achieve everything that embryonic stem cells are hoped to achieve, then your arguement against embryonic stem cell research continues to be unconvincing.
0	I love this line. I assume by "harm" you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another (physical in this case includes loss of items). So this would cut our laws in half. Walk around naked? No big deal! Have sex on the street why doing cocaine...go for it! Drunk in public? Who cares! The list can go on forever.
1	This is obviously not talking about abortion.
0	The Biologist must have been thinking that a "giant mushroom" was the cause and evolve it. Now, that's very funny! :)
1	Actually, you are misreprenting the scienctific answer in the following manner1) It is not evolutionists, it is astrophysicists.. 2) It is based on testable observations.. 3) Based on the available data, it is about 13.5 billion years old.4) It does not address the issue of 'Why we are here' at all. 5) It is not based on faith, but based on data. If data comes into change that evalutation, then by all means, it will be changed. This has happened afew times when it comes to cosmology. Our technology is good enough about gathering information it would probably take a real major discovery to change things drastically at this point (but that would be fun)Although you claim that religion can do the same thing, that can not be demonstrated. You are also making the false claim that people who are religious can not accept science.. the only that that is different is that they don't take the stories in the bible literallyi, but only as an allegory.
1	Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.
1	I believe we will see gay marriage, especially if a democrat is elected to the presidency in '08. If another republican gets in, it won't happen. They support bigotry and hate.
0	That's the thing, though; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport, on the other hand, doesn't know any better.
1	What for?
1	And yet the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center can come up with only a handful of incidents where a concealed carry holder assaulted another. Not even 300 incidents, as opposed to countless hundreds of thousands of concealed carry holders who have never done anything wrong. The math speaks for itself, you lose this one as well.

1	Private property rights are the most fundamental of all rights and the basis for any government at all. When a society ignores those basic rights it ceases to be civilized and diminishes to tyranny, anarchy and crime. Previous societies have always used criminals to encroach on property rights and deprive the people of fundamental rights of any kind. When people cease to have dominion and exercise rights to protect that property by any means possible there is tyranny. There is no rule of law in the UK any more.BRITAIN is there! Proud to have broken those ties back in 1776 :) emoticonXBye

1	Here speaks the voice of reason, who embraces the pathetic theory of creation, that utterly ridiculous group which passes itself off as a viable alternative to real science, whose outbursts demonstrate woeful ignorance of the world around us and scientific endeavour.  These are the ramblings of an individial with neither the wit nor wisdom to see beyond his own preconceived ideas, an inability to put aside bias, and one who plainly denies the power of the intellect in arriving at a balanced world-view.
1	To date, not a single profetallifer here has managed to come up with a way that, should, God forbid, the question of abortion be returned to the states, any state would enforce its ban on the procedure.  If State  A  bans abortions under any and all circumstances (the Palin proposal), and State  B  has a very liberal abortion law, just how do the officials from State  A  prevent their pregnant citizens from merely traveling to State  B  to have the procedure?  Similarly, what are the sanctions State  A  would put in place to enforce its abortion ban, and upon whom would they be enforced - the woman? the doctor?  So far, all we have heard is plaitudinous bloviation about the moral issue.  Let's get up close and personal. How will it work in the real world?

1	Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.
1	Well this was easy!  http://www.projectexploration.org/ni...11_04_2000.htm  There?s something big over here!? shouted Allison. We gathered around her find, a blackened, fossilized skull fragment more than a foot across. After puzzling over the piece briefly, I declared ?It?s a cow, a fossilized cow skull.?  Now what was a fossil cow skull doing in a place like this ? an area rich in dinosaur bone more than 100 million years old?  More pieces of the puzzle were being picked up by other team members. Dave exclaimed gleefully, ?Look, it?s human! Part of the skull!? as he held high the curved plate of bone that shields the massive human brain. He never expected to find fossil humans on a dinosaur expedition
0	and to think we got back a few gun rights, and we still have the patriot act.  i know all the reasons given for why "THEY" want to disarm us, what I am trying to understand is why one person wants to see them outlawed.
1	And that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact I am rather disgusted with it). If you'd like to see a more concise view from me, you can see the thread that Another_opinion started here: http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/9678-mothers-health-exception-where-do-we-draw-line.html
1	Nope. Life began at some moment of abiogenesis, billions of years ago. Sperm and ova are both alive. They do not suddenly become alive after being dead because they meet.

1	Actually...I do believe there ARE laws against people wearing masks in public. IIRC, some locations even have laws against adults wearing masks in public on Halloween.  But, as to the story...Yes, cops are IGNORANT and DO LIE ALL THE TIME.  But, what's new?  As for a trunk loaded with assault rifles...  I've done that several times.  Just not to an airport.  I hope he sues the city and I also hope he (or someone else) takes CA's anti-gun laws to the supreme court.
0	oh please dont give me that XXXX... its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement and point at me being at fault but that in and of itself shows you are at fault because you think that without your way the world would cease. Honestly, the world has lived without gay marriage its whole existence.... so why implement it now?? SHouldnt that say something about the human race when it steeps so low to want to call homosexuals married couples?
0	I'm not angry. In fact, I'm laughing at you right now.
0	oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although, I have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) We have the power. We are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)
1	The only state is Mass. and unless you use a friend's address, they won't marry out of state couples.
1	can we get a better difination of  gun control ? are you talking the leval of regulation i have in Indiana, the levals in NYC, having no controles (no checks, no licences for carry, no tax stamp for NFA weapons), or the other side of just asking Mr. and Mrs. America to turn them in?
1	There is the ever popular  smartest state  report that places kansas at #15 in the nation. It can be found at http://www.morganquitno.com/edrank.htm  A lot of kansas educators take exception to that report because it factors in things that may not be related. For example, Kansas kids score in the top 5 states in ALL testing categories, BUT, we score 38th in spending per pupil. We score poorly in teacher salaries (28), and do not have teachers on our school boards (conflict of interest). All those factors count against us, as well as several others. Then you have new jersey and vermont, where the kids apparently can't take a test, and where their average SAT scores may be confused with a shoe size, and they score in the top 5 because they spend a LOT more than kansas. A lot of people argue that they penalize states for efficiency in their education system.  If you want the most comprehensive report out there, go to www.alec.org and request a copy of their  report card for education . I think it is free, and it breaks down the states by several categories. It is what I always used to figure out how good a job our system was doing.

1	That is why scatter charts - such as the one that Adept produced - show figures per 1,000 population or whatever. It makes the data between countries directly comparible. A higher percentage of Americans are murdered every year than in any other  western  country save for N. Ireland (a region wracked by decades of near civil war, military occupation and terrorism).  Can you back up this claim?  Not true. The highest level of crime recorded in Florida was in 1988, the year after the concealed carry law was passed.  You have no evidence to back up that claim at all.
0	Should it be legalized? Only if every other country did it  Is it harmful? Yes more so then moderate alcohol use and worse then smoking  Should it be taxed once legalized? Yes.  Should laws still apply to it, such as DUIs and the like? Yes.
0	But not a legitimate concern in this case. I have never seen anyone show in any way that the Massachusetts court ruled incorrectly or abused their powers in the least. They based their ruling on their state constitution, which is exactly what they're supposed to do. "fiat" is simply a red flag to wave around to scare up some negative emotions.
1	right...genes evolved to the point to where they can't even be defined anymore....Evolution has evolved.... Natural selection naturally selected itself out. yup.
1	The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science.
1	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.
1	I know very little about evolution, but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes, so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape. Instead, I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor, but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago.  Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me, since I said, I am by no means an expert on evolution.
1	It isn't possible to tell. What is called the  scientific  approach is to analyse social statistics to derive probabilities, a methodology which assumes that the present is the same as the past, all well and good for the physical sciences, where the way particles behave does not change, but inappropriate in application to complex systems like people, that may react in ways totally unanticipated.  Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems, but the more ways you try to manipulate them, the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes.  So what do you do then, just take this method anyway, even given you can't predict the results, just take your best shot? When it fails, just say  oops, well, we had good intentions, we can't be blamed . If that's all we have to work with, we are truly screwed. There are however, alternative ways of deciding whether you should do something to trying to predict its outcome.
0	True, but I was referring to psychological explanations, not genuine reasons.
1	And it explains observations about morphology and physiology, about successions of flora and fauna. It explains coloration. It even explains why pandemic diseases arise and why they fade. It explains why an apparently harmful allele for a particular gene can increase in a population. In short, the theory of evolution explains biology.

0	I think if you man guns criminals will just keep using guns. Production of illegal firearms in Britain is apparently through the roof. They are converting starting pistols and  non firing  replicas into regular weapons.  Trying to prevent criminal use of firearms by making firearms illegal is stupid. Idiotic. I cannot even think of astrong enough word to describe the stupidity of that moronic mindset.
0	What's that smell? Did someone leave the bathroom door open?
0	Gun haters will stop when the right to bear arms is banned!  Criminals do not obey laws so they will have guns. Of course the gun haters like Sen. Feinstein will still have armed bodyguards.  Gun haters like Sen. Feinstein, and Sarah Brady could careless about keeping guns away from dangerous criminals. If these gun haters are so concerned about this. Why do gun haters pass laws that keep law abiding citizens from having guns?  Gun bans only keep guns away from the law abiding citizen!
0	My claim is that an aggressive move towards a police officer will get you an aggressive response. Should the officer have released the man, still armed, in order to let him get out his permit? The man was not arrested for having the gun, was he?  If I were a police officer, I'd prefer to explain to my supervisor why I may have overreacted, than to have my wife explain to the kids why daddy won't ever be coming home again.  Which details have I manufactured? I watched the clip. That is all.
1	Prove it! Prove that there would be no rooted trees at all within the sedimentary layers at all. And prove that there would be no tracks or burrows or evidence of plant life as we find. In fact we would expect to find all of those things as evidence that this event was fast and cataclysmic in order to find all of these things together in the same areas.

My father is a republican, i am a democrat and always will be. My father believes in abortion and he is a republican so your theory is so far wrong from beginning to end. Either way you look at it, Republican's have unsuccesfully pulled the abortion rights from american women so it really doesn't matter.
1	Certainly not. Natural selection is but one of the mechanisms that cause evolution.
1	Is there some sort of irony you're aiming for?  You imagine I am religious, and begin attacking my imaginary faith. You then ask if I have anything of substance to add.  You criticise the religious folks here for claiming they have the TRUTH about god, while preaching that you have the TRUTH about god.  So yes, the substance I have here is that atheists who boast about being able to disprove the existence of gods are hypocrites. You claim to not believe in god, and then claim to have proof of things that only a god could. You make the rest of us atheists look bad with your reasonless and hate filled ramblings.
1	Well, it seems pretty evident that you have know idea of the meaning of the word theory when used in science.
1	Wrong. It is a precision machine designed to kill effectively. It can be operated by other than human means.  Yes, you would be wrong.  No, they don't.  True, but nobody suggested there was such a grey area.  We accept your word.  I have never seen this, do you have examples?  So far as I am aware, nobody but you believes this to be the case.

0	Foolish Clergymen.How can this work? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart. You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs. It simply must be all or nothing. Otherwise you are wasting your time.
1	Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated. If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.  Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea. Thefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators, although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts. Why's that?  What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?
1	Actually, the reason people dismiss the concept of a diety is often not because of 'lies', but because there is no objective evidence of any diety what so ever.
1	Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial "Eve", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.One of the standard rebuttals you hear is "How did the Kangaroos get to Australia"? I don't know if that's covered in the Bible... if God transported them or not.
1	Well to be fair they do seem to have a problem distinguishing between armed and unarmed people. I recall an imigrant being shot 41 times with just some keys in his hand. Then there was the guy in the car shot while driving black.
0	Oh, right. And what would yours be? "We the humble people of the human species have decided to break away from Britan rule and form our own bubble community. No one has any rights whatsoever, and we restrict our citizens to living in bubbles because we cherish each life, from skin cells to bacteria to plants to embryos. In fact, we really have no purpose in life, we just life to not kill other lives.

And what criminal enterprises has the people of his good city people supplied other cities with. I mean besides the crimes his investigators committed. Drugs, thugs, and murderers to name a few.Bloomberg, stay the heck where you belong!
1	This is why the title is "God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)

1	So what does evolution stem from then? did Darwin find an annoymous manuscript in his study one day entitled  The Origin of the Species  that had appeared out of nowhere? Lets not try to paint up some new faces for paganism
1	Ok, so are you saying that nucleotides aren't individually selectable? Is that it?Well, actually, they are. No, I'm not saying that they are passed down separately or anything. Please don't write your rebuttal before reading this post.What I'm saying is that one nucleotide can make a difference in whether an organism survives or does not survive. For example, let's consider penguins and the Galapagos. Now, it is a well known fact that the Galapagos were formed relatively recently. Before then, it is generally accepted that penguins were in Antarctica only. In Antarctica, penguins had plenty of feathers, enough to die when they progressed to the tropics. However, penguins also had variation in their feathers, so when a current brought them to the Galapagos, they quickly started to evolve. The few nucleotides that controlled feather thickness made a large difference to the survival of the penguins. In this case, they were important enough to make a difference easily. The DNA was inherited as a single unit, but some single units had single parts that made a difference.

1	So he failed to follow procedure? So was one of the procedures to assist the child in holding the gun while the gun was being fired and to not stand at a distance? If that's the case then the instructor at the firing range was also partially at fault because it was also his responsibility to supervise the child. And I just found this:"SPRINGFIELD, Mass. - Authorities in Massachusetts are considering whether criminal charges should be filed in the death of an eight-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with an Uzi submachine-gun at a gun show. "Hampden County District Attorney William Bennett says he hasn't been able to find any law that would authorize a child to possess or fire a machine-gun."Criminal charges possible in boy's Uzi death, Massachusetts authorities say - Yahoo! Canada News So not only is allowing children to fire machines guns irresponsible it may also be illegal.
1	Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.We all lead your typical normal life.
0	It is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. Most protestors on both sides aren't great.one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a "hard decision" if you are pro-choice? Is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? Couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? Even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? You hear "It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder? No one would admit to this but it is statements like "It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. And in that case, I agree...that can be a tough decision.

1	I counted the cases listed, not the body counts of each case.
1	I'm not sure what you're saying.  The fundamental issue isn't how marriage should be defined, but whether or not the government ought to single out a particular special interest group -- straights -- for special treatment, notwithstanding promises to all citizens that all deserve equal protection under the United States Constitution.  The way to rectify the incongruity is to take away the special preference. Do away with all the tax breaks and special legal advantages that accrue only to straights or let those advantages accrue to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.

1	It doesn't matter if it's 'earth shattering' or not. By admitting that we hold different standards for the Bible proves my entire point: hypocrisy on the part of skeptics.
1	So now the definition of evolution is 'pre-existing genes switching on and off as needed for various environments?'It is these kinds of articles that are so transparently silly that really irritate me.An evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed. Switching genes on and off is why built in redundancy has generated such a wide variety of creatures in such a wide variety of environments.There has NEVER been 1 example of a newly created gene that provided a new beneficial function based entirely on new information forming on the gene.The mutations are ALWAYS a net loss of information and as the genetic load continues - eventually all life will morphidite and die out.The propaganda of the antibiotic resistant "Superbugs" was the biggest bunch of lieing nonsense of its time. There are still people who believe that too. They don't think - they believe.
1	23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so.
1	Zoos are indeed a good example. Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats, penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates. And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo: the absence of any predators, and the absence of any prey. So why don't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren't present?

0	I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal. The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the “LIFE” of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk. When both lives are going to be lost, it is better to save one as opposed to losing two. The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country.
1	No, the origin of the universe has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. Scientific disciplines have bounds. Biologists don't have to account for cosmology because it has nothing to do with the evolution of life on earth. However the universe came into being doesn't affect the theory of evolution. However life first arose has no bearing on the theory of evolution. The ultimate origin has nothing to do with the theory of evoution. I don't see where the definition you quoted does anything to make this point.......
1	Well, actually there is. Bat wings for example are one of the easier problems for evolution to solve (we can even see potential transitional stages in other animals like the flying squirrel). The co-option of existing structures is the bread and butter of evolution. Now, if bats and birds had four legs and wings, that would be more of a head-scratcher.
1	You started off with criticizing gun banning, but now you seem to be criticizing tough punishments for criminals. A May 2006 article in the Cape Times said that "National law currently provides for a sentence of 25 years for illegal firearm possession." http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php...icleId=3230121So if the death penalty is the punishment for illegal gun possession then I suppose the law must have changed recently. I wonder if the people who claim that we don't need more gun laws but just tougher punishments for people who break current gun laws would support such a penalty.
0	Jesus was a retarded ancient hippie who walked passed people who were starving and dying, yet didn't help them. Jesus is a man who ignored his family and considered his disciples family instead. Jesus is a man who didn't come to preach peace, but use a sword.Jesus is a man who didn't repudiate much of the Old Testament atrocities. Jesus is bad, and Jesus is GOd, therefore God is bad. I don't care what the biblical stoner said.

1	I could imagine someone plotting the data, making a straight line fit, then extrapolating back 5000 and 4 billion years, then waving their hands significantly, as if the graph proved something.
0	Really! Will you grant me the same benefit? Lets just say I have no moral problem with physically hurting you. Would you suggest that people who think that is wrong should not impose their belief system on me? You would certainly think they should impose their belief system on me. Chances are you would say something like  well, I am a human so therefore I have certain rights  to which I would respond that chloe and I believe the fetus is a human and we believe you are a human too so therefore the same standard applies.  The argument about not pushing your beliefs on others just never works because every law is pushing beliefs on people.
0	I got a chuckle out of this.  It's a blatant lie and you know it. Stir, stir, stir.  Good thing you know who isn't around to tear you a new one.  Waxy
1	A more precise term would be  broaden,  since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected,  diluted  or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only  change  would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only  change  in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.  The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.
1	Don't those science writers make things so clear for you people who have no idea of what science is or how it works?Actually, what is tested is the hypothesis. It is tested by making a prediction of a necessary observation and then devising a test of the prediction. Only when the hypothesis is supported should it be called a theory.
0	Here's an analogy  Marc9000: Ridiculously Absurd Comment User: Refutation Marc9000: AtHeIsT!
1	No, it doesn't. It is an example of how one part of the theory of evolution works to effect changes in a population.
1	And you've failed to explain exactly how Heller was a blank check endorsement on schemes such as gun rationing. Explain exactly how the judges ruling that the Second Amendment is truly an individual right, how DC's ban on handgun ownership and their trigger lock requirements being unconstitutional, would in any way suggest that one-gun-a-month laws pass constitutional muster.  Furthermore how to you reconcile the effects of gun rationing, with the fact that such laws make it absolutely impossible to catch gun traffickers in the act?  Give us some straight answers or leave the debate!
1	But that's not even how "creation science", or any religiously motivated science works. There is no checking involved - what I mean by that is that answers are always ad hoc. It doesn't matter if there is a better explanation available that does not involve mythology and superstition, if observations can be made to fit the religious scenario, it is evidence. Again, there is no checking of facts, i.e., no testing, and of course, no predictions.

1	I know that I'm hardly unique in rejecting the pious life that my teachers held up as the ideal: I was quite conscious at the time that I was merely a square peg in a round hole that was being bashed until it fitted. Parroting answers to questions that were themselves irrational wasted an absurd amount of time of course - but in other respects I received a good education for which I am still grateful.Nice to hear from someone who had a similar experience.
1	No.Sarah Brady wants increased budgets for law enforcement and gun control on the same bill. Which is a slimly trick typical of dirty politicians and lawyers.That is the ammo use used to claim the NRA is against increased law enforcement budget.The NRA stands for increased budget only on one bill before Congress.Sarah Brady notions are irrational because she wants more that what is stated above.Please check "no central database" vs a database.Please check Sarah Brady's 3 day waiting period + background check.I agree that rational laws are already on the books. I was merely re-enumerating them.How does Sarah Brady propose to reduce guns from the street? Only two ways possible: 1) Gun buy back 2) Consfication.Please check the other threads regarding the astronomical cost of a gun buy back. Please check the Consitution for right of property ownership.
0	Well, here is my take on it. I really believe that only the truly evil end up in Hell. Those like Hitler. I think that anyone else goes to heaven - Wiccans, Atheists, Buddhists, etc. - anyone who follows Christ's message of love, tolerance, and acceptance, whether knowingly or not. Those who preach hate, and those who act on that hate, like Hitler, the KKK, and any other person/persons filled with hate (sad to say, this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here) are the ones who will end up in hell.
1	This isn't my position. I'm arguing that your attempts to demonize magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds is foolish. Furthermore, if no honest citizen needs a 15 round magazine, then no police officer needs them either. If we can reload them quickly enough for it to not matter, then the police can do it too.
0	But you know what really doesn't make sense? Why are they evangelising to people (who they know most of them will reject them) if those people get a special dispensation? They'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing, would they not? Why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation? emoticonXConfused

1	Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also.
1	I'm not sure what you are saying. Are you saying that you think that theropod dinosaurs should have more feathers than this Sinornithosaurus does? First you claim that the entire forelimb would have been useless, and when shown that it was not you claim that the feathers could not have existed because they would be useless, and now when shown a fossil that shows feathers, you are surprised that there are not more.  I suspect that not all of the feathers on this creature are apparent in the fossil.  http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather5.jpg  http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather9a.jpg  http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather11.jpg  But there are enough to show that feathered dinosaurs did, in fact exist. Any argument about whether or not is is possible that such creatures existed is moot. It is irrelevant that you feel that such limbs would have been useless. Obviously they were not.  So now we return to your original confused and erroneous arguments.
0	Yes they have. Are you denying that conservatives and religious-right advocates have not been trying to ban gay marrige?
1	Actually they are what make us animals. It's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human.  There is no precise definition as to what it is that makes someone a person. An in-fetu fetus are not a person IMO even though they may well have a brain, nervous system and organs.
0	This is the "right" SCOTUS to hear the case, IMO. ;)

1	In time of war: The Israeli answer to terrorism by Massad Ayoob Issue #81   Israel began the program of armed citizen guards in the schools after the Maalot massacre in the 1970s, when a large number of children were slain in a terrorist incident. The volunteer parents work in plain clothes, armed with concealed semi-automatic pistols, and are trained by Israel&#8217;s home guard. It is significant that in the more than a quarter century between Maalot and the incident mentioned above when the citizen guards shot down the terrorist in the school in 2002, not a single child was murdered in an Israeli school! 
0	This is different than stating that abortion is the same, in principle, as killing a born child. We are back on the question of "Why would someone do this horrible thing" which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people. There are many threads on the subject :)That the fetus did not come into existance by it's own choice is really irrelevant. That it did not cause problems of it's own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems.
0	haha, so because of this you should make fun of men and not women? That makes no sense but I figured you'd say this.
1	Abortion is about pregnancy - and whether or a not a woman wants to be or can sustain a pregnancy - physically, emotionally and economically.  Nobody has to be a parent. That is why there is adoption, safe-haven laws, the signing away of parental rights - and oh yes, an ever growing population of dead beat dads.  I am still waiting to see proof of all the mourning dads due to women having abortions. Most of those women are desperate and alone - or have the blessing of the father.
1	Comments about asexual reproduction are not relevant. The statement is true, and again one of Darwin's observations. The later part of the statement is a reference to a popular evolutionary philosophy during the latter half of the 19th century, essentialism. Except for creationists, essentialism was debunked and cast aside during the years of the synthesis.
0	The desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense. They're so impotent in their abilities to get tough on criminals, they feel it necessary to go after the most unrelated sources to try and make themselves look big and busy.Why not just build a big wall to cut itself off from the rest of the world, and set up high security check points so cars coming and going can be checked to ensure no contraband is being smuggled in.
1	His point was criticism of people managing the numbers of their population with abortion. It also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations.

1	so since most abortions weren't rape, do you still support abortions for people who are raped? Just wondering.
1	Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:  1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.  2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood.
1	Yes, homo habilus was a monkey. I've been telling people that for years.
1	Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By "true human" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later.
1	His point was criticism of people managing the numbers of their population with abortion. It also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations.
1	I can well believe that pandion cannot answer this question; no one can accurately answer it. We know that baldness, as a genetic condition, is polygenetic (ie it's controlled by multiple genes) and autosomal (the genes [or at least the bulk of them] do not reside on the X or Y chromosomes). Despite being autosomal, people appear statistically slightly more likely to exhibit balness if the trait comes from their mother's side of the family. Even if we knew precisely which genes were involved and which of those genes your kids had, we still cannot tell you the likihood of your children being bald. The chances of the gene combination being expressed in the correct way to cause baldness are dependent on age, hormone levels, stress and probably a variety of other environmental conditions.

1	Hmmm, you cannot study the laws of logic. That’s like saying we cannot study math because it as no effect on us. Try violating the law of non-contradiction in a test you take. Say to person that is giving the test, “The wrong answer can be the right answer at the same time sir, because the law of non-contradiction has no effect and does not exist for me, beside its impossible it study the laws of logic or anything abstract like this test.”

1	this is where the most confusion comes in, and why many evolutionist that are particular about the definition of evolution gets into arguments. #3 is the only one close to the scientific definition, and still this is technically lacking and only serves the very layman level  you continue to insist that all misinformation is a result of YEC's distorting the definitions. YEC's didnt write the definitions in dictionary.com, noe the hundreds of other dictionarys that have similar definitions. furthermore, your definitions have done nothing to educate people who are seeking more information. they only serve to display your disdain for creationists and your lack of objectivity

1	This is not a case of disagreement on the interpretation of evidence, it is science versus science fiction.  It is a direct accusation by the CURATOR OF BIRDS for the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION against all the proponents of the dino bird story.  Not some as you say  crackpot  Creationist.  These are only two of the many scientist that are embarrassed by the outrageous dishonesty of their contemporaries. .
1	Who has ever made this claim? Please, show me, because I have never once heard it. Of course most individuals are physically capable of producing offspring. Natural selection is dependant upon which individuals will pass their genetic information on to the next generation, and that is determined by at least two factors that I can think of at the moment: 1.) An individual being able to survive long enough to find a mate, and 2.) Actually being able to find a mate and produce offspring, which brings me to my next point:
0	Only a fool would deny the validity of Geology in legitimate science. Just as only a fool would deny the bible answers our questions in spiritual matters, such as how did we get here. But to apply Geology to a false science such as evo is to corrupt it and will no doubt be proven to result in false conclussions ln many areas of its application.  So much for this thread that was started in order to bait and mock rather than seek to learn or actually teach anything.
0	Now you're claiming that a gun is a precision machine. Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as  assault weapons  are  inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip . Which is it?  Prove it then.  Then you've got absolutely no justification for supporting gun control, you should be supporting criminal control instead.  Then why do you keep supporting laws that would restrict access to guns, rather than making it harder for violent offenders to get out of prison and back on the streets where they pose the greatest danger?  Then what's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms? Do you fear something in particular? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better?
0	I've decided that I will answer this question once and for all if someone can prove to me why people need tennis racquets. If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response. Have at it.
0	Ah, the excuse for deadbeat dads. Seems like you are advocating for more abortions, then!  Just different ones. He doesn't have to endure the pregnancy, f.ex.  That is how God designed it for the man. Luckily the woman also have additional choices such as abortion, since she also has to rpovide a body to the pregnancy.

1	First, you wouldn't use a handgun against an F-16 fighter plane. It's stupid and useless, but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down, that's for sure. The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is. I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns, since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it (like you can't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you can't yell fire in a crowd.) Isn't this what most "living document" people say? Oh, I get it now? It's not about that is it? The fact of the matter is, you are dissatisfied that the line wasn't drawn to limit even more of it, i.e. a complete ban on firearms, only the national guard or armed forces should have them. Sorry, but if you were to do that, it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more. The SCOTUS did the right thing in this instance because they acknowledged there is a line to be drawn, but not the one that prohibits all law abiding citizens from owning firearm.

1	Supply is already controlled. The Gun Control Act of 1968 lists individuals who're prohibited from firearms ownership or possession, one of the groups that're prohibited are individuals who've been found guilty of a felony offense. That means the legal network is about as tightly regulated as it can be while still remaining open to the public.

1	He didn't make any testable claims. He merely adopted the usual Creationist tactic of pontificating:  I don't believe it, therefore it isn't true!  When you guys make testable claims, you always turn out to be wrong, which is why you rarely offer anything remotely scientific.

0	Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again.

Sadly, he seems to be falling back on that old creationist saw about  where are the intermediates.

1	But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on. 
1	From wiki: During the Italian Campaign of 1943 and 1944, 100,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side, notably in the fighting on the Winter Line and Gustav Line. By the time of the Normandy Invasion, the Free French forces numbered more than 400,000 strong. 900 Free French paratroopers landed as part of the in the British Special Air Service Brigade (S.A.S.); the Free French 2nd Armoured Division, under General Leclerc, landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 1 August 1944, and eventually led the drive towards Paris, while the divisions which had been fighting in Italy became part of the French First Army, under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and joined the U.S. 7th Army in Operation Dragoon. This operation was the Allied invasion of southern France. The Allied forces advanced up the line of the Rhône River to liberate the Vosges and southern Alsace.Are we good so far?Again from wiki: The French Resistance played a valuable role in facilitating the Allies' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and Provence on August 15, by providing military intelligence on the Atlantic Wall and Wehrmacht deployments and coordinating acts of sabotage on power, transport and telecommunications networks.As old Abe said you have removed all doubt!

I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked.
0	Of course they do. Just look at Black Phoenix. You would probably be suprised how many people believe just like he does. I live in the Bible belt, so the majority of people I know are creationists.
1	Gee, and in what year did he state that? 2005? No way. 2000? No. 1995? Nope. 1990? Nah. 1985? Couldn't be. Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know.
1	 Most firearms used in crime are not recovered. About 63% of the traceable handguns recovered in Toronto originated in the US. A large proportion of the firearms recovered in crimes have had their serial numbers removed.   http://www.guncontrol.ca/English/Hom...ngsandguns.pdf   According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2,637 crime guns were reported to the Canadian Firearms Program in 2008; 925 were linked to a firearms dealer, and three-quarters of those originated in the US.   http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Ameri....html/(page)/2

0	Nope a true believer will insist on his belief system even in the presense of overwheliming contrary evidence. So far you have not managed to produce andy such evidence to the contrary. Should you do so in a rational scientific way which can be verified then Darwinists will throw down the theory and join you in your conclusions with verve. I am not however going to wait for it to happen. Tis up to you.
1	I think you are mis reading what he said. His statement is more about preparedness than seeing threats everywhere. I think the paranoia fits with the anti gunners more so than the gun owner. The anti gunner sees every gun owner as a threat. Where the gun owner doesn?t see a threat but prepares for one

1	Forgive me, I'm new to this. What does  YEC  stand for?  Also, to say that evolution isn't concerned with  beginnings  seems disingenuous to me.

1	It was in the news for a while and I'm pretty sure the inquiry found that it was a terrible misfortune based on miscommunication between the hospital and the parents. There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post.Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself.Being in an abortion forum, and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion, though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced, hence the question.
1	There is nothing religious about babies.... They should be concerned with preventing the death of an innocent person... who made no mistakes, violated no laws, and whos only crime is existance.if you dont think courts can protect babies, then do you.. deserve any protection?If a baby can be killed simply because it is an inconvience... then why does it suddenly become a crime if the baby is 2 days old?what difference is there between a child in the womb, and one which was just born?its still the same baby.The point is.. we can prevent all these reckless abortions, if... if... if.. we can convince all these wild loose sex acts... to be done with a condom...Guys dont like condoms....They must be made to recognise that they cannot simply walk away.The only time, the girl will give the name... is when the guy made promises, and refuses to marry... refuses to care.. and the girl is left alone.in those cases the bastards deserve to do hard labor, for atleast 3 months.The state should promote... emoticonXLove-Mosheh Thezion

1	You are correct, but bear in mind it is just Bragg's introduction to the programme and not the opinion of the panel. This issue is explored in more detail when Dawkins talks about a population of self replicating molecules (27:00) and how the first life, as we define it would have arisen when there was concentration of these molecules and then the first cells- there is no suggestion of a single entity that was responsible for all subsequent life.  Thanks for the links on the articles btw.

1	right...genes evolved to the point to where they can't even be defined anymore....Evolution has evolved.... Natural selection naturally selected itself out. yup.
1	It's not just a kernel of uncertainty. Jews and Christians alike say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, but a reading of the Pentateuch makes it obvious that this cannot be true. Luke did not write the book of Luke, the apostle Matthew did not write the book of Matthew, and we don't even claim to know the authors of many books of the Bible. Look up the Documentary hypothesis; early scholars shuffled "holy writings" together like a deck of cards to get the Old Testament that everybody today knows and loves.

1	So we kill the baby instead? Interesting idea. How about instead we reform the fostor and adoption care system. No, people arn't looking for healthy, white infants, they are looking for infants. This automatically reduces 90% of adoption cases. The so called "Healthy white infants" make up 70% of all adoption cases, seeing that 30% of abortion are done by blacks, and latinos and most minorities don't have abortions, but instead keep their children.

It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.
0	Blah, blah, blah.Stop throwing out discredited and biased stories. Explain in your own terms, exactly how having a gun makes you more likely to be shot. Explain the mechanics of how this works. Go on and try, make some sense rather than cherry picking poorly executed "studies" that prove nothing.You made the claim that if you have a gun in your possession, this fact magnifies your chances of somehow being shot. What you suggest can only happen if magic somehow exists, like the legally-owned guns sends out powerful magnetic waves to attract the criminals and hypnotizes them to shoot in a situation that they normally wouldn't shoot.
0	And with natural selection?  Are you trying to get us to accept your conclusions without providing evidence for your premises? It doesn't work.
1	Indeed. And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with "standard" theory a laugh. Clearly, evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly. Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement.
1	Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong. However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.You are out of your league.

1	Me neither.  I've even wathc an entire Christian conservative documentry on the  science  of creationism. Funny enough there wasn't a single scientific fact presented to support creationism, they merely tried to use  science  to disprove evolution. Which is absurd, given that all their facts were wrong.  Creationist work on the premise of selective data backed by faith, versus theory that is backed with data.
1	Actually they are what make us animals. It's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human.  There is no precise definition as to what it is that makes someone a person. An in-fetu fetus are not a person IMO even though they may well have a brain, nervous system and organs.
1	No. I think that certian people are going to continue chiping away at the constution until things reach a critical mass, then there will be a violent correction. It is inevitable that a government whose growth is as radical as our governments will eventually collapse under it's own weight (see  Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire ).  The majority of Americans cannot describe america without including the words  freedom  and  rights . These are the supposed cornerstones of American society. When people see our constition, especially the bill of rights, chipped away at, I think it makes them uncomfortable, even if they do tolerate it.

1	Nobody I know sanctions adultery. There are already serious consequences built in against it. As far a same sex marriage, I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty. Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages. Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished.
1	"True" is not a good use of language to describe opinion. With regard to his opinion, I think he makes some good points, so I don't really need to ask him if its true. You on the other hand do need to speak to Olsen as you are claiming his letter rubbishes the concept of evolution- an opinion I hazard he would very much disagree with.
1	Cannot be demostrated? What? The very fact that it is called the Theory of Evolution suggests that it is scientific by nature.   Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion. Religions are made up of people who believe in something and ask for no proof and ignore evidence to the contrary. Theories are made up of people who believe in something based on logic and much consideration with all evidence taken into account. Theories more closely resemble facts than they do religion IMO.

0	How do you know?
0	I am not religious. However, I have spent some time studying religion, and your analysis is problematic. For a start, most early religions don't have an idea of heaven or even an afterlife (eg. early Judaism and Hinduism, both focused on success in this life).  Also, 2000 years ago many were aware the world was round.

1	Thanks!  There's a petrified forest in Mississippi also. I don't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces, but I'll find out next trip.  I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?  Likely, the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen. Other inert gases could have done the same.
1	I suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti DP stance. The rate of recidivism that produces dead innocent victims by paroled criminals far out weights the number of executed innocent men. fix the judicial system. Make lawyers and law enforcement accountable for the errors that lead to deadly mistakes. Quit making future victims pay for incompetence in law enforcement. Dead murderers do not murder again. Tugging at heart strings over the death of a murderer or the terror he feels on the way to the chamber gets no response. No joy, no sorrow.
1	And yet the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center can come up with only a handful of incidents where a concealed carry holder assaulted another.

Raup, Curator of Geology, Museum of Natural History, Chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely one’s belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific.But that’s not at all what Dr. Raup was stating. While Googling for a fuller quote, I ran across a page that showed how this – and many other – statements by Dr. Raup were distorted by Creationists. To start with, here is a fuller quote:
0	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.

1	A more precise term would be  broaden,  since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected,  diluted  or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only  change  would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only  change  in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.  The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.
1	I'm not sure what you're talking about here.
1	Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are "better suited" than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there?

1	Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.

1	Yes, but the sperm has the FATHER?S DNA, which makes it part of the father. Secondly, the fetus can reproduce, by reproducing it?s cells. If you?re talking about sexual reproduction infants can?t do that either.  It?s not alive.  No, because animals don?t have human DNA, and don?t have the capability of being as productive as humans. One could compare a child with animals; many animals are smarter than children.

1	Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable.
1	Let's take this slowly...a) Montalban is asked to give a definition of unknowables, and does soMach: It's illogical, merely defining it doesn't prove it exists.b) Mach is asked to show a scientific test for darkMach: Look I don't have a scientific test for dark, but I can prove it exists by giving a definition of it!Once again you defy yourself! So, merely defining 'darkness' does not prove it exists BY SCIENCE. What you have done is to confirm that it can't be defined BY SCIENCE.SHOW ME THE SCIENCE THAT DEFINES DARKNESS. If you can't then we have evidence for a suggestion that something exists (in nature) that science can't test for.

1	Where to start. The term Marriage appears 41 times in the NIV (New International Version). The term Marry appears 42 times in the NIV. But there are some relevant verses that speak to the rightness or wrongness of marriage in different situations; most of which refer to moral issues which is something people in this generation don't want to consider at all. For example, here the bible speaks about keeping the marriage BED pure and undefiled. Hbr 13:4 Marriage {is to be held} in honor among all, and the {marriage} bed {is to be} undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.And here is where God consecrated the relationship (Marriage) between Man and Woman through Adam and Eve. He also gave Man dominion over all the animals of the World at this time. No where does the bible refer to gay marriage anywhere in the positive sense as the concept was never raised or dreamt of by anyone in the ancient world, homosexuals included. Only in this generation have the morals and values of society become so reprobate that these various unnatural forms of sexual perversions are seen as right and normal.Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them(Adam and Eve), and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."Exd 22:19 "Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.Sex with animals was once a death penalty offense. Today, we have web sites promoting it.Lev. 20:13 "'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.ROM 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.Now all one must do to rationally determine that God, through His word condemns the concept of homosexual marriage is to look at his attitude on homosexuality. If God considers homosexuality so unnatural an act and a death penalty offense under the OT Law, do you really believe that He thinks gay marriage is right, acceptable or normal?
1	That was jsut plain silly. A single car will produce more emmisiosn then all the termites in your state.  Rember c02 is one part of the equation.
1	Oh I agree, but at the same time, and much more important, are those churches adhering to the whole counsel of G-d?? Because if they are, then the  mega church  has the greater responsibility to the community. If they aren't then you have accurately described what Jesus rebukes.
1	I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the pro-life argument relies exclusively on religious doctrine. I'm a Conservative and religious, but I think that abortion can be discussed without bringing religion into it. My personal opinion is it's a mistake for Pro-lifers to bring religion into it because it fuels the hatred of the God-less Left LMAO
0	By your own admission you haven't 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?
1	It is perfectly possible to be both a devout Christian and accept the fact of evolution. Evidence: my mum is a priest in the Church of England and also has a pHD in zoology - she accepts evolution as fact. She is in no way unique in this.

0	Oh really? Gun ownership allowed these "lunatics" as you call them, to become government dictators? If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, you're saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself, just like that? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation, without a single ounce of resistance just because they're armed?
1	And what "basic science" would that be? Did you look up "self organizing systems" yet?
0	I don't care what medical standards are, having a bacterial infection doesn't mean that you have actual culture on your side.  What's really going on is a war of opinions and beliefs. On one side you have the group that believes in individual rights and freedoms, and on the other you have those believe that, since no right is absolute in scope, that's the green light to go ahead and attempt to restrict and infringe on anything and everything they can, through any method available to them.
0	Too damn bad. The nature of the Second Amendment had to be addressed, it was, now shut up and move on.

1	Oh, please show me this. I wait with bated breath for you to provide the quotation in which I  assumed  that evolution has been  disproved   I'm really looking forward to your providing of this. Until then, you aren't worth my time, strawman.
0	Absolutely nothing could persuade me to change my mind.  It is absolutely abhorrent to me that a woman would be denied ownership and autonomy over her own body. It is a gross violation of human rights and liberty.  Here I stand, for liberty and human rights. I shall not be moved.
1	I realize you said  the jury is still out , which indicates that if I present evidence for one side, that does not settle it: especially if the statement is some 15 years old. However, the quote is fairly relevant and I know right where to find it, so what the heck not post it.

1	But those are only the book sthat were taken into the big collection. What about the other ones? Or did I not read all there is to read on that site? One of the apocryphical texts may very well be written by Thomas, the apostle Thomas. None of the writers of the four well known Gospels were apostles, right? They were writers, heard the story quite a few years after and do not agree on all that much actually. There are definitely four different stories on how he was crucified for instance.
0	Actually its not sickening in any way. These kids are at risk and need to know the resources available to them to avoid realizing those risks. Frankly I thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future. Knowledge can keep them out of deep trouble. Ignorance will not do so.
1	Try going to a concert, party, club, and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke....doubtful (unless it is second hand) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not. The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that doesn't mean every pot head will go to crack. HBO had a good special about this some time back.
1	Qualification: Do the proponents of  safe sex  for teens with condoms and contraceptives support or oppose laws regarding statutory rape?  You are probably right in that this may not exactly fit with the abortion forum but it may be closely related.
1	Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.
1	I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.
0	You're saying it's impossible to take marriage out of the government? Give all people currently married a civil union, and let people from now on get a civil union from the government, and marriage from the church. It really wouldn't be that hard.
0	Amazing how regularly they shoot themselves in the foot isn't it? ;)
1	Well he HAS admitted he can't prove his belief. I guess that posting here would admit his false dichotomies that it's either literal genesis or evolution are false and god knows the world will end when that happens. Super admitting he's wrong? Never going to happen.
0	I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.  Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation.
1	So what? It's not like institutions in this country haven't been changed before, including the supposed intitution of marriage!  Guess what? It's called progress, get used to it.
0	Well, that last bit applies to me, but scientists otherwise epitomize rationality, as opposed to the sky-fairy, Noah's-Flood, angel-packing crowd.
0	I see you know nothing about the subject...hardly a surprise.
0	So he knew everything Paul did, what was written in Revelation...  Assumption and premise are the same. And this is about God's view: others might try to work out which texts go back to Jesus, the Word of God, others what is common in religious experience, or what is rational for an all-good being.  The Word of God is Jesus. But God's will is transmitted through scripture and tradition  It's exactly like that: which is why it's bibliolarty. The Bible is not the Supreme Word: Jesus is. As in: 'In the beginning was the Word': not the Bible, mind you, the Word.  As it happens, most Muslims believe the Qu'ran is coeternal (but created) with God. They might call it the Word.
1	Well that is a problem for the ardent creationist isn't it? Or for any Christian. The Bible says that God cannot lie. Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? You see the Bible says that God promises never to send a flood to destroy the whole earth again:Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. If the flood were a local flood, as some say, then God is a liar. There have been many local floods througout history. If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted. Consider this excercise in logic:If God is who he says he is in the Bible, and his very voice created the universe, then can God lie? If light didn't exist, and then God said let there be light and light then existed -- if there is that sort of creative power in the Word of God -- can God lie? Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice. Whatever you said became true for all eternity. If you contradicted yourself, one reality would be destroyed for another, wouldn't it? If God said "let there be light, and there was light" where light had not been before, then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth? Wouldn't the former be destroyed and the new become reality?In the Bible, Jesus says "I am the way, the Truth, and the light". How can someone "be" the truth, unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice. You see, if any part of the Bible is a lie, then the whole idea of God and Jesus comes crumbling down like a house of cards.
0	Actually, if you want to check, you will find that biologists themselves will point out the holes. We still have a lot to learn. Many of the holes have been closed even in my lifetime and the creationist god-of-the-gaps is being reduced to smaller and smaller gaps. But if you want a creationist to  join the real world , you're going to have to do more than be offensive and insulting. You might present some actual facts to support your position. Of course, I presume that you will actually educate yourself before presenting the facts.  Have a nice day.
0	Just like a mayor, steal more chain than he could swim with...:)  Or: "The State, there is no power but the State" - (who said this?)
0	So as a conservative...you believe in having someone else decide for you what kind of sex you can have in the privacy of your home? Wow, maybe I'm not conservative after all. Some Jews think pork is disgusting...would you support them banning you from eating pork? I'm not saying you can't think what you want about whatever you want (I personally think drinking blood and eating dead flesh is creepy but would never attempt to enjoin a christian from doing so)...but you cross the line when you attempt to deny someone liberty when it doesn't effect you.
1	Yea an explanation would be nice.....I don't know that I've had anything deleted on here before -- (it could have happened without me knowing it) -- but I have no idea why that was deleted. If there was something specific I said, the post should have been snipped, not deleted altogether.
1	Yes, it does. But determining that age is not a question answered by evolution.
0	Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.
1	I think that if for arguments sake that if Darwin was a racist that carried out genocides then I still don't see what Macroevolution would have to do with it. I will say it again. If you start with the mistaken belief some people are inferior then Eugenics immediately seems reasonable since it only relies on the idea that some people are inferior and the fact that parents are like their offspring.
1	It was a fair question for Tim to ask, even your beloved NRA web-site has the 2nd Amendment located in top-right. (http://www.nraila.com/issues/FactSheets/)  How does the law of contract explicitly protect your right to carry a gun?  Are you allowed to shoot someone if they breach a contract?  What about torts laws? - where a contract doesn't exist.
0	**This is the line that caused me to butt in, walking-fish. Again, my apologies, but prs has no idea of the difference between Lamarckian and Darwinian theory, and how that theoretical difference would be reflected in different social theories. As far as I can tell prs has nothing but preconceived misconceptions about this. I felt compelled to speak up. Hope you're not put out about my intrusion.

0	Seer, dude,.. chill.  I'm on your side.  I mis-spoke.  I don't follow your  womb trapped child  line of reason. It's not a comment about anything other than the fact that I haven't put much thought into it.  Relax a bit and take a deep breath.  Try to realize that not all who are sceptical about your posts are your enemies.
1	Oh dear.Do you actually know what a scientist means when they call something a "theory"? Because it seems to me that you do not. The concept of gravity is "only a theory", yet oddly enough I don't see anyone trying to say that we should stop accepting the existence of the force of gravity because of this. The SCIENTIFIC theory of Evolution is a scientific theory that has been and continues to be extensively researched and developed. It should be taught in schools.Creationism (or Intelligent Design) is not a scientific theory, and is not supported by any evidence. If it must be allowed into schools at all it should be confined to the religious studies classroom, not the science laboratory.
0	** This is the best response you've got!?! What a loser!!
1	Please start with the Bible passage. Then explain what you mean by "stretched out" and why this would affect our perception of space and time.
1	This thread started with a challenge to God's omnipotence. It had nothing to do with omniscience. Our definition of omnipotent is  having virtually unlimited authority or influence. That appears to rule out the ability to do every conceivable task, uncluding those that are illogical. It does not diminish the power of God.
1	Not to rain on anyone's parade:"The liberal hysteria about the tea parties and town hall protests, kicked off by the Obama administration’s issuance of a Homeland Security bulletin warning of right wing terrorists and extremists, has led to a lot of hyperbole on the left about how, well, extreme and terrorist-like the right is becoming. And to be sure, there are some nuts who are politically active on the right who should probably be locked up for their own good. But there are plenty of nuts like that on the left as well.A Texas woman faces trial this month in Austin on charges she threatened to kill a government informant who infiltrated an Austin-based group that planned to bomb the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., last fall.Katyanne Marie Kibby, 25, was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Austin. She is accused of retaliating against Brandon Darby, the community activist-turned-informant who helped federal prosecutors win convictions against Bradley Neal Crowder, 24, and David Guy McKay, 23.Prosecutors say the e-mail threat was made Jan. 10. That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008.Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations. The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby. Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didn’t use them, a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby.Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby, saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues.Kibby, who lives in Houston, is free on bond. If convicted, she could face 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. She could not be reached for comment.What’s funny is that, even as this is going on, the left is all atwitter about some gun owners legally carrying their firearms to tea parties in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights. You hear about that endlessly on news outlets like MSNBC, but I’ll bet Kibby’s name has never been mentioned on the network. Not to mention Crowder’s name or McKay’s.As far as I’m concerned, violence has no place in American politics right now. I firmly believe that we citizens should embrace our 2nd amendment rights as they were enshrined in the Constitution against a day when, as Thomas Jefferson put it, the “tree of liberty” will need to be replenished once again by the blood of “patriots and tyrants.” But that time is certainly not now.And people who plan on firebombing political conventions, or those who beat down peaceful protesters in the streets (I’m looking at you, SEIU) are tyrants. Not patriots."
0	Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?
1	Well said.  With this religion, the gap is very wide between the  average guy  and  authority , because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government.
1	Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either.
0	I know what you mean. You should see some of the other  books  he has at his site as well.  Well, now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists, but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism (Read: Religious beliefs).
0	This statement almost defines pathetic. Anyone who requires the gov't to validate who they call family, or who they love and share their life with really needs to get their priorities sorted out.
1	Well firstly we do not know that "volition" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.

Your going to be forced to keep your machinegun clean. Your going to be forced to learn to place head shots at 300 yards. Your going to be forced to keep ammo sealed by paper tape. Sure I do all that right now. I'd be happy to do that with a free machinegun and free ammo. Is that what YOU want? The government handing out free machineguns? Just checking if you want that. I want it. Give me a free machinegun. Give my friends who shoot at the range and shoot rifle matches, give them all free machineguns and free ammo. Bring it on.
1	SNIPThis opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an "assault weapons ban" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier.

And this one too (abeit watered down- having to wear a to church)  Goes to show just when you thought we had gone all progressive there are some people wanting hiding blatant sexism behind the veil of religion.

1	A specific age is picked because it occurs sometime and there is no way to know in any specific individual whether their pre-frontal cortex is up to snuff or not. There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis. If this occurs (I think it's clear that it does) and if this is a rational reason for treating persons differently (that is, of course, arguable) then the line must be drawn somewhere. I was wrong to say 18 is arbitrary. I misused the word. I would assume that most people have a mature CNS by that age, so that is why it is picked. The objective evidence of this is done looking at populations, not individuals. Subjectively, anyone who has kids will know that a young teen's judgement is pretty bizarre at times.
1	TF Green was a small little airport when I moved here 10years ago. It is now 10 times that size with multiple terminals and dozens of airlines. Yes, it has changed. It would be fun!

1	The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)

1	The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan. It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought. This is where your mistake lies.
1	I think that what you two are doing is simply trading evidences. Saying someone is 'wrong' and directing them to a atheist web-site is not proof. You should merely be saying, 'here is an alternative argument'  I say this because I can access a number of science posts that state the exact opposite of what you say, and show that they can find evidence for a flood.
1	There was a study in Britain back in 1999 that concluded the risk of breast cancer following an abortion was trivial, almost as insignificant as getting lung cancer from a lifetime exposure to second-hand smoke - UNLESS it was the first pregnancy that was interrupted. If the first pregnancy was interrupted, the likelihood of subsequent breast cancer was right up there with the likelihood of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. (The study is obviously not politically correct, so I've seen no mention of it on this side of the Atlantic.) The study didn't address causes, and only noted the correlation, but the lead doctor did speculate that it may have something to do with hormonal changes that need to run to completion.  Once again, the state of Florida takes the lead in losing and abusing its children.
1	It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.

1	But private citizens run background checks on other citizens all the time. I rent property. I make sure my tenants aren't felons before I lease anything. I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon. It is just something I personally would choose to do if I didn't know the buyer I was selling to...

1	No one said he invented guns!A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1][2]
1	Neutral? One of the main standards and reference points for science and evolution on the internet is talkorigins.org. It's promoted as an educational site - a place with answers to criticisms of the evolutionary theory. It's every bit as biased as AnswersinGenesis, yet in many cases it's difficult for ID proponents to target. Part of the broad definition of evolution is microevolution, about the only segment of the broad term that is provable. They can masterfully employ that to make an ID proponent appear uninformed or irrational if he questions happenstance orignis, or other unproven evolutionary assumptions. They make their atheism clear in many ways however. They devote a page to comment about the "International Flat Earth Society", pretending they believe it to be a legitimate site. Almost any rational adult can see that it's phony. (Wikopedia calls it a hoax) There's nothing neutral, or even agnostic, about that site, and it appears to represent the anti-ID-in-schools mindset to a T. If there's actually a more neutral, agnostic, scientific website that opposes ID being taught in schools, I'd like to see it.

0	As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off. Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.As for caring for the kid once they're here, that can be costly. More so for time. If you're poor, EIC and earned child tax credits and deductions help alleviate the child's cost (the gov't wants another generation of consumers and tax payers). You can get your liability to near 0 and have the gov't kick back some money. But, we're talking adoption.On top of these decisions, you also have consider the health risks fo carring the child to term OR the risks involved in getting an abortion. It's nice to think that you'll 'plan' a child later but, life seldom works that way. I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery. I'd be ironic for another yuppy type who can't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt...and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there aren't any easily to be had here...since they were all aborted. Also, the older you get, the more health issues possible for the child.As for the intellectuals who wait to have birth later in life, watch Idiocracy starring Luke Wilson. Then smile as it IS the XXXXXX who are inheriting the world. But, what would you care? You won't be here...and most likely, neither will your decendents.If you want to kill it, then just kill it and say 'What's it too you?' or even 'Yeah, so I'm selfish and didn't want to take time out of my life to be bothered with details, bugger off ya wanker!'

0	Spoken like a true man.
1	Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis &amp; Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine).

Why do bats continue to rely on sonar to  see?  Why haven't they evolved eyes over time? In my opinion, this guy is basically saying that if you had a bunch of bricks and mortar, a building could be built. He just leaves out how you get the bricks and mortar, which is the whole problem.
0	Taking away peoples right to an abortion is a great idea !!  People are confused and don't really know they want a kid, they just think they don't. It will all be alright after the kid arrives, .. they will discover we know best and keep and love and shelter these kids in a nurturing way. We know best and we know that none of them will ever just end up in a trash can or droped off at the local childrens home to join the thousands of other unwanted kids. None will ever become a pawn in a divorce situation, nore will any of them be sold into child slavery or prostitution.  How do we know all this ? .. We just know people who don't think they are ready for or want a kid really do !!  They will love and nurture it and all will be well.
1	Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.  We're waiting to hear about three or four more.  As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want.
1	This all comes down to fear of retribution from gay people. They know that they have been the leading cause of our oppression, they know that the tide and culture is turning in our favor. Sometimes the oppressor finds in a minority it oppress a mirror of itself. They think it is right to oppress us and see can not see that we have no interest in oppressing them or even revenge for the oppression.
1	Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.

1	Sometimes God allows Satan to cause suffering to His people and to Christians in order for them to grow stronger and as a form of punishment.

I am, however, astonished and outraged that our CITIZENS in the UNITED STATES have to go to CHINA to get a treatement like this to help them.  It is absolutely disgusting what is happening to our country due to religious nuts/fundies who oppose stem cell research and various other advances in science. Sometimes I think they won't be happy until this country becomes a third world country at least techologically and scientifically.
1	Is this debate, either audio, video, or transcription, available on line, or will it be? I have bee a bit occupied in preparing for a tropical storm (possible hurricane) that turned out to be a fizzle (3.2 inches of rain over 10 hours and maybe 30 mph winds at worst). I'm dying to know if Comfort brought up the banana. It has always been my understanding that bananas (as well as cucumbers) were perfectly suited to other purposes. At least, I was told that it was the case by certain less than reverent female acquaintances when I was in college.
1	Also keep in mind that some changes can happen quickly if you select for a quality that's already present in the population. Something like beak size will following a bell curve. Most beaks close to average size, some larger than average, some smaller. If pressures change so that those with below average beak size gain some advantage than they can exploit it instantly. From the word go they will be eating better and be more healthy than their big beaked cousins, and so more likely to breed successfully come next breeding season. And if the little beakers are the most successful breeders than we would expect to see alot of little beaks in the next generation. Basically, the genetic variety is already present in the population, so exploiting that variety can happen quickly.
1	Very weak analogies. Your position has been that 'mechanistic' models of DNA expression are fundamentally wrong. The success of genetic modification (of bacteria and of eukaryotic organisms) provides strong support for their being fundamentally sound.But wabbit, how come I'm privileged with a reply? I thought I was on ignore, along with anyone else who knows what they're talking about.

1	Exactly. Moreover, in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am. is dicta (arguments not pertinent to the verdict) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit.A question for the "original intent" crowd:What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment?
1	You do know that 'polystrate' is not a term used by geologists at all, don't you?  However, you do have times that there is very rapid sedimentation.  The answer to that 'condundrum' has been known since the 19th century, and creationists don't get it yet.  From  Polystrate  Tree Fossils  Since the answer was shown to be answered in 1868, it shows that effort to use that 'conundrum'' is rather dishonest and ignorant.
1	This is why religion may not survive the future.  People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.  The only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation.  Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here.
1	Really? Let's go to the OP. You said "What this post explains is that Occam’s razor denies the accuracy of the bible because it makes too many assumptions to be more likely than the scientific explanation. Therefore, it is poor logic to accept the bible without further evidence."Now, if we are not "to accept the bible", what are we supposed to do? "See my first example for a reason that we should keep our beliefs uncomplicated whenever possible. If we didn’t, we would be swamped with thousands of explanations for very simple events, and most of the explanations would be illogical."What do you mean by "illogical". In context it seems that you are saying "wrong". Are you? If not, specify in detail how do you think an "illogical" belief would be correct?"Except that Occam's razor is used for comparing hypotheses. "Back to a scientific use of parsimony. What are we comparing them for? "Most likely" or for which hypothesis is true and which is false? I submit that you are being disingenuous. You actually mean that you can use parsimony to decide which hypothesis is true, but, when pressed that this doesn't work, fall back to "most likely".So let me ask, how "most likely"? What are the odds? How do you compute them? Is "most likely" 51% ot 49% or 100% to 0% or somewhere in between? Or does it change for each situation? If "most likely" changes, then how do we know what you actually mean?

1	Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.
0	I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state.
1	No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.
1	I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:  There is no evidence ANYWHERE that the second ammendment is a collective right. We ghave been over this multiple times, and the evidence simply does not exist, and an organization like the ACLU should be well aware of this.

1	That is why scatter charts - such as the one that Adept produced - show figures per 1,000 population or whatever. It makes the data between countries directly comparible. A higher percentage of Americans are murdered every year than in any other  western  country save for N. Ireland (a region wracked by decades of near civil war, military occupation and terrorism).  Can you back up this claim?  Not true. The highest level of crime recorded in Florida was in 1988, the year after the concealed carry law was passed.  You have no evidence to back up that claim at all.
0	Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.
1	Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution. Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all. He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited (but not all variability), he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others. From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so. To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal!As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations .... Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth. Till then I will claim that such a transformation cannot be accomplished without alteration of the underlying genome. I am most dubious that you have any such example at hand. emoticonXGood

1	Biological evolution doesn't involve the formation of life nor is it a rule that life can only come from life. It's a tendency because it is vastly more efficient.
1	No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean "wild guess with no foundation". That seems to be what you want the word to mean. In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested. You see, a theory is predictive. I'll give you some examples of scientific theories. The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life. It is done all the time. While it may be debatable that a virus is alive, the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution.

It was removed when advanced dating techniques not only showed that the bones were only a few hundred years old, but that some of them weren't even human."http://www.mentalfloss.com/press_oklahoman2.htmDo you guarantee that all of the other displays at the Museum are true? No, of course not. Many other things there said to be 'true' are only 'true' in a transient sense of the word (that only science seems to use)http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_...klywiener.html Suggests that Piltdown Man had good science behind it, at the time.Never-the-less the Natural History Museum provides many examples of artistic licence, such as the 'human-like' hand given to a restoration of Australopithecus, displayed at the museum."Shattering the Myths of Darwinism", p205

1	Actually, you are still quibbling. First, after I told you that you were wrong you came up with the "it may be in his diary" bit. Later it has moved to an earlier version of OTOOS. The answer is quite simple. NOPE. I searched through The LIfe and Letters of Charles Darwin, vol I & II, More Letters of Charles Darwin, vol I & II, On the Origin of Species, 1st and 6th editions, The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, and The Voyage of the Beagle. None even contain the word "microbiology". Darwin made several references to microscopes and his use of them. He had one on the Beagle. But nowhere does any of that discussion refer to the impossibility of his theory.Maybe you would be so kind as to tell me where you had access to Darwin's diary. Or maybe you either made up that assertion or were just an ignorant dupe of someone like Hovind making a claim like that. Where did it come from.
0	Nah I'm not debating this. I'm trying to show that this debate doesn't really prove anything. But I'm sure you can get the names of those who are willing to debate this and look them up in the future if you ever want an easy debate victory :)
0	A sign like that would hardly be nessecary where I live. We have very restrictive gun-laws and hardly anyone owns a gun.  And no, people does not discipline themselves. You might claim I have to much trust in the government, I would claim you have to much trust in your fellow man. When you give freedom to the people you give freedom to criminals too. I donÂ´t trust guns to only be used in 'selfdefense'.  I want my government to uphold justice and to protect me from criminals. ThatÂ´s one of their purposes. And that is impossible without a certain amount of control over the citizens.
0	Exactly so.  Pro-choice people would not impose their values on anyone; profetallifers would impose theirs on every woman of child bearing age.emoticon_angry
1	Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.
1	A lot more truth to this statement that a person would think. My statement was in jest, but somewhat true. Yes, the jurors could not vote on concrete evidence, but just how much circumstantial evidence do jurors need anyway ? To quote the mighty TS, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, craps like a duck, at what point does it become a duck ??
1	Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.
0	You may see a vast differene, many do not. The  moral  grounds for many is simply the justification for their homophobia.
0	So once again you’re steering away from the debate? I don't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post. You're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened. You're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation. I'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now.[QUOTE]The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\QUOTE]It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up. I guess in your mind this makes sense but I don't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic.

It's obvious to everyone that he's constantly avoiding it even when asked point blank several times. A sign of argumental failure is constant avoidance of a simple question.
1	Not one that a solid case can be made for. If it happened they would be numberless just as Darwin said.Dr. Colin Patterson, Senior Paleontologist of the British Museum of Natural History, in an interview on BBC television, said...I mean the stories, the narratives about change over time. How the dinosaurs became extinct, how the mammals evolved, where man came from. These seem to me to be little more than story-telling. And this is the result about cladistics because as it turns out, as it seems to me, all one can learn about the history of life is learned from systematics, from groupings one finds in nature. The rest of it is story-telling of one sort or another. We have access to the tips of a tree, the tree itself is a theory and people who pretend to know about the tree and to describe what went on with it, how the branches came off and the twigs came off are, I think, telling storiesStorrs Olson, curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History said:"The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion."

1	And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?
0	Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.  (Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)
0	A consequence of the pro-choice position would mean the man doesn't pay child support unless he wants to. It is irrelevant who carries the child. Maybe he is not ready for a child...this is the same excuse allowable for women under the pro-choice argument. So he shouldn't have to pay it if he doesn't want to. In fact, alimony she go the same way under the pro-choice thinking. If not then you just look like a hypocrite.
0	Well, I haven't mutated into some other species last time I checked.
1	Again, I did not say that they did not recommend abortion... they do offer it as an option, but I have never heard of anyone being 'forced' to have one by Planned Parenthood. All I was disputing was when you said that they ALWAYS recommended it. They do offer pregnancy counseling, along with pregnancy testing. They also offer birth control, gynecological care, STD testing, infertility testing, sexual education counseling, prenatal care, adoption referrals.. etc...Almost all of these things are offered by my regular doctor, and probably most other doctors as well. They don't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they aren't a hospital, and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done, but if a clinic does an abortion themselves, they have to do an ultrasound first, to determine how far along the pregnancy is, because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks. If an ob/gyn sees an ultrasound with severe problems, they will sometimes recommend an abortion too.All in all, I just thought that your remark that Planned Parenthood always recommended an abortion was wrong. They also offer services to men too, do you think they recommend abortion to them as well??I have nothing wrong with you being pro-life... I honestly don't. I think it's good that you stand up for what you believe in. But when you make a statement on how a woman is wrong to have an abortion even if her own life is in danger, I find that a little ignorant. I'm not saying that you are ignorant yourself, but I don't think you are as well informed on everything as you seem to think you are.And can I ask, are you male? If you are, you will never, ever be in any type of situation like that, so how can you decide what a woman should do when SHE is faced with a situation?
1	Here's an interesting one:Lipoprotein Lipase S447X: A Naturally Occurring Gain-of-Function Mutation.Brief ReviewsArteriosclerosis, Thrombosis & Vascular Biology. 26(6):1236-1245, June 2006.Rip, Jaap; Nierman, Melchior C.; Ross, Colin J.; Jukema, Jan Wouter; Hayden, Michael R.; Kastelein, John J.P.; Stroes, Erik S.G.; Kuivenhoven, Jan AlbertAbstract:mdash;: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. Since the gene was cloned in 1989, more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant. It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X. This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant.This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries.Or this one:APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY, May 1995, p. 2020–2022 Vol. 61, No. 50099-2240/95/$04.0010Copyright q 1995, American Society for MicrobiologyEmergence of Nylon Oligomer Degradation Enzymes inPseudomonas aeruginosa PAO through Experimental EvolutionIRFAN D.

1	Oh goody. Some more of your well informed opinion based on wishful thinking, no research and even less actual thought. Probably the bird you are talking about is the Cormorant (Nannopterum harrisi). Yes, it is flightless because it has no need to fly. There were no natural preditors in the Galapagos and the bird is a sea bird. It swims and eats fish. It's wings are much reduced because it swims by kicking rather than by "flying" through the water like a penguin. Like the penguin it is a diving bird.
1	I think you can forget about God the super  engineer  on this one: your final question contains a necessary and sufficient condition to explain the case.
1	Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions. It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners. The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time.
1	Yet according to PP themselves, they provide FAR more abortions and EC services than any of their other services. :PPPFA Services (2002-2003)Surgical abortions: 227,385 Emergency contraception: 633,756 Prenatal care: 15,860 Adoption referrals: 1,963 (Source: www.plannedparenthood.org)
1	So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?
1	As someone who does not believe that every word in the Bible is inspired, I&#8217;ll still debate the subject using the Bible verses. I&#8217;m not stating my belief about abortion in the following, just as I said, debating the verses.  Exodus implies that a fetus is a piece of property that is owned by the husband. Notice the mother has no say in the matter, just the husband who decides the price of the fetus.  The Psalms you quoted is not clear about the subject. It talks about God making the author, not about when he became a human being. And Psalms 22:10 implies that God was his God from the time he was born.  I&#8217;m not sure where Gentiles is in the Bible but the verse you quoted again does not state when someone becomes a human being.  The Bible is not filled with quotes about humanity in the womb. There are a few references about a fetus but nothing that states when a human being begins. Even if you believe you become a human being before birth, the question is, at what point?  You state that a fetus must be a human being. And why, well because you think it must be.  Your last argument is that it must be a human being because it has a human genetic code. Dead people have human genetic code. I don&#8217;t believe they are human beings.  Biogenesis does not address when a fetus becomes a human being.
1	I think the reason for the differences in translations is because the translations i think are geared more to audience. There are easier translations for little kids and those who have a hard time with bigger words. Another thing that has to be taken into account is that it is not always easy to translate exactly from one language to another. Some English words have several equivalents in other languages so the differences in the translations come from which equivalent was chosen by the translators.  P.S. This of course is not to argue with what the person stated above.
1	I started reading the article and discovered the old 'bait and switch' con job.  They give the notion that they may find some 'fast evolving coding of genes' in the gamete reproduction. Big build-up in that area of thought. So was there any fast evolving genes discovered or was it more of the same ol' fantasy?  Then when I closed the window with the website, it closed all my other windows as well. So I won't be going back to review it unless I have nothing else going on.
1	Well I'm not advocating this but technically doesn't the Constitution dictate than anyone from birth should be able to own a gun? The second amendment guarantees the right of everyone to bear arms (actually prohibits ANY restrictions against keeping and bearing arms) and the 14th amendment defines a citizen to be anyone born or naturalized in the US.
1	Well, no, it doesn't. That's sort of the point of the article I linked to. No organismic response, no hypermutable state (apart from one coincidentally arising in a minority of the adaptive population), no EAM.L&D, as an experiment, had its limitations, namely the lethality of the selective environment. What the article I linked to demonstrates is that Cairns&Foster also has limitations. Most of the time, it should be remembered, the C&F methodology yields the same results as L&D; the circumstances yielding the anomalous results that were a temporary shot-in-the-arm for Lamarckism were very particular. The bacteria had to possess a leaky allele that still operated at a low efficiency, and that functionality had to be just barely inhibited by scavenger cells.C&F still did something useful: it highlighted the potential importance of amplification mutagenesis, where genes that do a slightly useful job accumulate under selection, increasing the chances that a more successful variant of the gene will arise within any given population.I'll check out the other experiment you mention; thanks for clearing that up.
0	Is it only religious people who insite violence and hatred toward gays? NO!  You're attempting, weakly at that, to jump on the Frist-train by saying hes persecuting religious people. As if religious people are being singled out.
0	This is a pretty touchy issue, and I agree with the different points of view.. most of them make sense... while I don't personally agree with abortion, I don't feel that I have the right to tell someone else what they should do. The way I see it, is that it's their body, their life, they are the ones who will be affected by their decision. I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make.
1	Oh really...  biology: a branch of knowledge that deals with living organisms and vital processes  I don't see the synonym  evolution  anywhere in that definition. Some biologists may study evolution, but biology is NOT evolution.
0	You live in a shed in the middle of the woods dont you? Possibly having scripture verses painted on your walls instead of wallpaper. I bet you know stats of all kinds..like how many people died from smoking last year, or in car crashes. Perhaps your knowledge of these  power Facts  makes up for power that you lack in most other areas of life. You have misunderstood me from the beginning. Your thoughts are the only thing in this conversation that are out of  con·text .  You cannot go wrong quoting scripture..I agree with it. But you dont sound like you want somebody to agree with you...in fact you attack a fellow believer when they ask a question, or paraphrase a scripture to ask a question that may pose a counter point to what you are saying... and on top of that you interpret that as propaganda... nowhere in your definition did I see propaganda as a question. One thing I am glad about, if past experiance or knowledge does not hold water... then you are no expert here either. Funny how that works.. isnt it?  Like apples?
1	Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.
1	I believe I said the military does not use sawed off shot guns, and then I said it does use other forms of shot guns.  You have never did explain why you as a gun owner defends every gun control law Sarah Brady wants!  There is a name for people like you and I believe it is traitor!
0	Well it depends he could always be a sperm donor or make some Lesbian couple happy :)
0	So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders.
1	Nice spin by way of projection but you are wrong as usual. I find your defination of your position to be too funny. Like it is some how wrong to turn the tables on the left by using their methods. You still fail to address the fact of liberal firearm owners. Or is the fact of owning a firearm enough to have one drummed out of the liberal camp, buttons ripped off and sword broken? emoticonXBye
0	Because when someone attacks the pregnant woman, she doesn't have a choice whether the fetus dies. When she has an abortion, it is her choice.  A woman should be able to choose whether or not she remains pregnant.
0	how is that fair? basically your reasoning is  lets just give the christians the whole marriage thing, and let the gays get married at city hall by a 67 year old judge who probably doesnt agree with them anyways.   i mean, what happened to the separtion of church and state? did we, somewhere along the line forget, that little document we call the constitution. it dosnt simply say  see bible   everybody should have equal rights. no matter your race, creed, or religion. if joe and bob want to get married, how the heck is it our place to stop them? and im sorry if it makes you uncomfortable to think of that, but unless joe comes to your house to shoot your dog, its not really your concern.  and come on, im tired of all these ppl using the bible to cover up simple ignorance and prejudice.  so why dont we all take a hop-skip-and- jump into 2007, re evaluate our morals, and get a clue.
1	But private citizens run background checks on other citizens all the time. I rent property. I make sure my tenants aren't felons before I lease anything. I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon. It is just something I personally would choose to do if I didn't know the buyer I was selling to...
1	Same evidence, different interpretations based on different starting faiths.We will use the Lucy type skeleton and the next supposed evolutionary progression Homo Hablis (for short hand, HH). CAT scans of the inner ear of HH showed that the semi-circular cannals, which determine balance and locomotion, are more like those of baboons than those of humans. This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.Hence, the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model. This is just an example of what they may do with some fossils, IMVHO.
1	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.
1	Well all you have to do is tell us the minimum time during which it could happen by NDS theory and then how long it actually took and we can compare the numbers. Of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers. Enjoy emoticon_xan

1	Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.We're waiting to hear about three or four more.As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want.
0	Yeah, ok, keep up with your  Creationist  therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of  Evolution.   Keep your religion out of MY Government!
0	And what're you going to do when a criminal says  F**k you and your gun control, it's not gonna keep me from getting a gun if I want one ?
1	also josephdphillips sterilization would be automatically part of the process after the family has two kids. didn't mention it originally, but probably a good idea, since what would stop them otherwise?
0	More evidence of your selfish motives, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it sort of disqualifies you from being objective and reasonable about the abortion issue. Its obvious if you were in the fetus' position, you'd be against abortion. I seem to detect a lot of abiguity and contraction on where you stand on this
1	Entirely wrong on this point. I was in sierra leone during hte rebellion, nad they did have a working government structure from begining to end. Civilians in rebel controlled portions of sierra leone were hacked apart with machetes (literally) and horribly treated because they had no way to fight back. In several circumstances, entire villages were bypassed by the rebels becasue one or 2 people had ignored the ban on guns. Rebels showed up, took fire from the town, and went and found an easier town to pick on. There was a move by certain british folks who worked for certain british companies to arm the civilian population. Unfortunatly, the UN impoased an arms embargo against sierra leone and short circuited the plan.
1	So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated.
0	Good points IMHO. I think you are holding your own here. But I want to read your views on how your detailed analyses can make a real difference.  There are many with pre-conceived notions about evolution they learned in high-school, so changing opinions is not easy.  Your ideas would really be a help here.  Thanks
0	No, the legal middle ground between no same-sex marriage and only same-sex marriage is marriage for all, just as the legal middle ground between no opposite-sex marriage and only opposite-sex marriage is marriage for all.  Another possiblity would be marriage for none, but let's not go there.
1	So having guns is not part of being armed?
0	Well that was a good start. Are you planning on insulting everyone who replies to your post?  Of course it would be more difficult for criminals to get hold of guns if there were fewer of them around. It would also make it more difficult for children to get hold of them, or feuding neighbours who, on the spur of the moment, think that waving a gun around might bring about a solution to their problems.  If you don't think you're going to like the answers to your question, then don't ask the question.  Smiley
1	Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!
0	Oh no, it's not too complex for us to understand. So please explain to we simpletons how Intelligent Design is nothing more than animism. But first, here is the truth regarding this newest perverse propaganda you are promoting.
1	No disagreements.Something left out (probably because it was assumed), is memory.What you call mental existence I would say is a description of what causes or leads to personal identity. To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity. There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity, but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required, and without a brain, there is no mind, so a brain is required.It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain, there is no person.Of course, others will disagree.Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity, but if this is true, identical twins (with identical DNA) would have to share one personal identity, and one soul.In the case of a chimera, two souls/unique DNA in two zygotes, would have to blend into one person/soul. (No, most chimeras are not schizophrenic).I believe an integral part of [personal identity>mental existence>personhood] is memory. Whether it is short term, or long term, without memory there is no sense of self. (I may be stating the obvious, but you never know.)~ ~ ~ ~ ~It is not clear if your list of indicators for mental existence is “one will suffice”, or “several are required”.I don’t think it matters all that much, but I’m not sure, just wondering.
1	Yes, T. Kennedy is the alias of a known terrorist, and Ted Kennedy got punished because of it. And many are advocating that such a system be used to deny Second Amendment rights and be used to try innocent people in a court of law.  No, not COULD happen, it HAS happened already, this is the reality of the situation.
1	Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.  Perhaps that is because the superstitious mythology of creationism isn't relevant. The fact that scientists have learned something new and that creationists are frightened by it is of no concern. There isn't all that much of a controversy among scientists. They will, of course, do everything they can in an effort to verify these findings, but science thrives on controversy. And, of course, dissent based on superstitious mythology is meaningless. It actually takes evidence. Something that creationists lack.  I guess you weren't paying attention to discussions and didn't read the articles. So we now have the usual creationist evidence against all science,  I just can't believe... 
1	The US government would open themselves up to insane criticism throughout the world if they banned all guns and spit on the constitution like that. There is no way this will ever happen. Also I don't think the government would want to have our people without guns. They will do what is in their best interest and it is in their interest to have a well armed population to serve as a last line of defense if we ever were to be invaded. I would expect that what is happening in Iraq right now would happen on a much larger scale if anyone ever invaded the US. That alone is a great deterrent to the US ever being invaded regardless of the size or strength of our army. So even on hard times I would expect that the government only support the right to bear arms.
1	Matt and I go way back. We've been oil and water for years. ;)
0	And yet, in this case, your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage. And you aren't outraged by that? That's what I don't understand. The article focused on Palin 'needing to clarify', but didn't even take Biden to task for being against gay marriage!  I would think you'd want to know WHY he's against gay marriage. Particularly since he's your preferred candidate, and gay marriage seems to be a very important issue to you. But hey, maybe you don't care!
0	isn't it a good feeling wake up, log on to the internet, and see your theory smoked?
0	More bull XXXX. First, our Creationist seems to forget that many millions of bases in the human genome are nonfunctional. Why would random changes to 3 or 4 of those nucleotides be fatal? They wouldn't.Besides, our Creationist is trying to make it seem like all of the millions of mutations he references - which is an invalid number - would occur in a single animal?!?!?!??!?! No, the ~1.5 million nucleotide changes in the human lineage (half the nucleotide differences between the chimp and human genomes) would have had about 6 million years to accumulate.Finally, our Creationists seems to be aware of the fact that humans differ among themselves at about 1 out of every 200 base pairs. By his reasoning, shouldn't we all be dead?

1	Once again, you prove Pandion's asseration correct. Weaker species? Who said anything about that? Some species evolved to meet new niches, acquire more food, safer habitats. Hardly weaker. As for suddenly, you basically admit you are ignorant about evolution and sciences, which was Pandion's basic asseration. They did not change suddenly, but over time. 
0	It was my understanding that the tread is about the hypocrisy of those who want to defend marriage from the inclusion of gay people.
1	Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution.
1	if God, even a non-biblical God, existed, then would you say that he would have always existed? wouldnt this God be the same and consistent throughout eternity? so far, we agree that the existence of a documented/biblical God cannot be proven. an undocumented/non-biblical God has never even been encountered, not even in the last 5000 years when the other Gods were being written about. if this God had the ability to make himself known at his perogative, why would he not do so until now? and if he doesnt show himself/make his existence known now why would he wait until later? we could extrapolate this forever, and this undocumented/non-biblical God would never "choose to" manifest. therefore, the existence of such a God can never be proventhe same applies for 3. if such a God never "decides to" manifest his presence, then even if he exists it would be of absolutely no consequence to mankind at all
0	No, its not. Thats a strawman. I have never stated anything of the sort. You just cannot debate honestly. I never said that since one argument is wrong, that all are wrong. I am saying that I can prove all the arguments wrong independantly. Not that I have to.Now, any of you able to give even a hint of an intelligent answer to the OP? Or does that shatter your delusion that you dont support murdering children?
1	No. Creatures don't evolve. Populations evolve. If a portion of a paticular species gets isolated and evoves into a new species, what makes you think that the parent species has to die?
0	I think what Steeeve is noting is that one of the central tenets of Catholicism is ecclesiastical authority. This isn't like disagreeing on the color of the choir robes. If you don't recognize the authority of the Pope, then basically you aren't really Catholic.

If you don't want to die, don't break the law. It's not rocket science, all you need to do is stop being bad.
1	And certain versions of Mark:15He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”Are they mistakenly reading this?
1	Illegal immigrants aren't subject to the same legal protections as American citizens.  Please explain how somebody can pose enough danger to warrant them being added to the terrorist watch list, and prohibited from being able to legally buy a gun, and at the same time they aren't dangerous enough to be immediately arrested and shipped off to Guantanamo Bay for indefinite detention without trial.
0	So Gup20 wants to play word games. (Sigh) This is usually a sign that he or she has run out of logical arguments. Anyway, this topic is in another thread. I won't discuss it here.
0	Actually I pretty much agree with you here. Sex means possible pregnancy. If you don't want it there's condoms, birth control pills, and the morning-after pill. You shouldn't have sex without some sort of birth control if you don't want a kid, seems like common sense to me.

This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is.
1	This is what comes from trying to reason with people to whom the truth means nothing. Only proving their version of reality is what is important. They would rather cling to unprovable assumptions which are based in nothing more than man made outcomes derived from wishful thinking. They insist they have supplied us with proof that life first appeared on Earth 4.3 Billion Years ago and are offended when I don't accept their proof as reliable. My question is, how can any rational person really believe that what is theorized to have happened 4.3 billion years ago is so reliable as to be beyond questioning.  These people scoff and mock 5000 and even 2000 year old history from written records by educated people who are renowned in History for their record keeping accuracy while accepting these massive assumptions regarding what might have happened 4+ billion years ago on a dead Planet, if the Planet even existed at all back then. The irrationality of the so called intellectual of today boggles the mind.  And by the way, welcome to the forum.
1	I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are.

0	And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?
0	This is a poor poor analogy. Abortion is dealing with the decision to end another's life in order to sustain a preferred lifestyle. I think you may have been better off putting it this way. Say you dont drive drunk (personally against it for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drive drunk if they so choose. So, you are personally against drunk driving but you are "pro-choice" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves). Therefore there should be no laws preventing it and no punishment for the sad results. Pro-life would be: You don't drive drunk (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure no one else is able to either.
0	Thats a very compact piece of logic.  I imagine that you are a very efficient individual.
1	Actually, you could probably make your point better if you referred to a "theistic evolutionist" who rejected all creation stories (and other history) in the bible.As for your point itself, it is fairly correct (in my opinion). Theistic evolution makes no assertions that contradict either evolutionary theory or the teachings of the bible (morals, etc.). This presents no problems for atheistic evolutionists.

Having the people decide on legislative matters seems alot like having a commitee of your neighbors decide on the proper way to perform your heart surgery. Too many states make it far too easy to get an issue on the ballot, and alot of very stupid laws and constituional amendments have resulted. Take a look at California politics if you want some examples.

1	Actually if you were educated in history you would know that Hitler was an evolutionists. If you got that simple trivial thing wrong, why should I trust you in things that I do not know? Atheistic evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith acknowledged of Hitler: The Germal Fuhrer ... is an evolutinoist; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of eolution.  ~ Keith, A., 1947.  Evolution and Ethics , Putman, New York, p.230.Don't worry, some of my friends didn't know either. If evolution is true, than it should have some reasonable explanation as to why we have morals, but it doesn't.
1	But the point is that the Razor should not be used to test hypotheses! That isn't what Ockham stated the Razor as. The whole point is that you can't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing. In the example, impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement. Ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon.The Razor states that the animal was struck. Period. From that observations you make hypotheses as to what struck the animal. Hi_Its_Me listed only 2 of the possible hypotheses. Then, without testing either hyopothesis, he eliminated one as "unlikely" and used "unlikely" to = false. But there was not testing. Yet testing is not only possible but easy. Last year my daughter's car hit a deer. The deer's carcass wasn't found but it would have had pieces of glass embedded in it. Testing those pieces would show that they came from the windshield of a Pontiac Sunfire. That eliminates the alien spaceship hypothesis. (Unless you propose the ad hoc hypothesis that the spaceship coincidentally had glass identical to that of a Pontiace Sunfire. However, that ad hoc hypothesis can't be independently tested and is therefore invalid). 
1	Any form of legislation is a voting matter. That's the way our system works.
1	Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists, the design argument is from the creationist side. It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley. Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality (Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ's College, Cambridge that Paley did). The argument from design is presented as  proof  of God or an  intelligent  designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism. But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore isn't  proof . Evolutionary biologists don't assert that there is not god, only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one.  Science is naturalistic. Even if some scientists (and others) are philosophical naturalists, science doesn't work that way. It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural. It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism.

1	No, the animals came to Noah because God commanded two of each kind to do so. Except for the ones that were supposed to come in sevens, even though all animals ended up coming in twos. (That's what happens when you combine similar but not identical stories...) Kangaroos and wallabies trekked from Australia, swimming to Southeast Asia and traversing subcontinental jungle to hop aboard. Whales and manatees swam right in through the window. And of course, after God had killed  every thing that is in the earth,  a dove managed to find a live olive leaf as a sign of receding floodwaters.  The rest can be explained by God-magic, of course. Don't be silly.
1	Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?
1	It means life is holistic, not reductionist. Life, as is the genome, is a system -- an irreducibly complex system -- not an assortment of pieces that just happen to be fitted together over time via random genetic changes culled by nonrandom death.

1	Well if it has nothing to do with a militia that would mean that the preamble is merely unnecessary verbiage. So you want people to just ignore the plain text of the Second Amendment- at least the part you don't like. The preamble lets us know that the main focus if not the sole focus of this amendment is the militia. David Konig is another historian that has found both the individual rights interpretation and the collective interpretation unsatisfactory. He says the Second Amendment protects an individual right that is exercised collectively. "Indeed, to serve in the militia and participate in this civic duty was more than a duty: it was a civic right of a peculiarly eighteenth-century nature unlike either the 'individual' or 'collective' models argued for today. On neither side of the Atlantic, that is, did the debate concern itself with this right in the present-day sense of an 'individual' or personal constitutional right; but at the same time, its common emphasis on widespread individual arms-bearing for public service distinguishes it from today's narrowly applied 'collective' application to the National Guard. No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia; no effective militia could serve its purpose without an armed citizenry. This type of right may appear paradoxical to us today, but it fitted 'the inner coherence of a given system of beliefs'4 held by people in the past, and which made sense to those familiar with the concept of an individual right exercised collectively."David Thomas Konig | The Second Amendment: A Missing Transatlantic Context for the Historical Meaning of "the Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms" | Law and History Review, 22.1 | The History Cooperative

1	For the record - the level of assistance available (pregnant or not) varies from state to state. I was living in New Mexico when I got pregnant and a clever woman working at the welfare office figured out a way to fib to the state to get me the medical care they would have otherwise denied.
1	While 'commonly' may or may not be true, this does end up happening at least some of the time (and possibly a lot of the time). It's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent... for example, a woman enters a clinic because she's confused and thinking about getting an abortion... she wants to consider the option of abortion, though she's not really comfortable with the idea. The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure, and that lasting psychological effects rarely (if ever) occur. The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman's life. I'd encourage you to read the book "Forbidden Grief" by Theresa Burke. It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions, and the experiences they have gone through. Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion. (In reality, short of physical force, no one can 'force' you to do something you don't want to do, but things can be said and done to mislead a person --intentionally or otherwise-- into thinking that's what they want themselves.)
0	Again, if it were only that simple.  I don't have the  obligation to respect the choices  of those who infringe upon the rights of another. Rapists make a  choice.

But I expect we don't always agree on what the consequences should be for some of the choices people make.

1	Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under "evolution" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose "science" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea.

1	The US has a very high homicide rate compared to other developed nations. They also have a lot of guns. What studies are you talking about?  I think your theory too simple. Guns make it easier to kill people. Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun?   From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders. (Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes.   http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm  Some facts you may find interesting:   Crime in England and Wales remains stable and the chances of being a victim of crime are still the lowest in more than twenty years, according to the first quarterly crime update published today by the Home Office.....  British Crime Survey trends since 1997 indicate:  All crime down 27 per cent  Burglary down 39 per cent  Vehicle thefts down 32 per cent  Violence crime down 26 per cent   http://www.policesupers.com/scripts/...SP?news_id=314

1	No, it's not. The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since. First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's "hopeful monsters" that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the "only micromutations" view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's. Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a "semi-macro" mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record). Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times.
0	So, you agree that your proposal for pro-life advocates may not be reasonable?
0	Not much of anything else either, it would seem.
1	My fault for being too broad. The existence of a creator cannot be proven or disproven, and literal interpretation of the Bible can be disproven by science.  That is one of my hangups w/the Bible. The '7 days thing', how basically everything has existed thousands, not millions of years. It is rather inconceivable that God (or any god) created everything in 7 'human' days, and has sat around since then, pretty much status quo. And all the billion yr old objects discovered are just incorrect science.
0	Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).
1	But you have incorrectly defined evolution, both in a biological and non-biological context. In Darwin's time the word evolution meant change along a particular path towards a particular end. For example, stellar evolution. That is not what Darwin proposed. That is what creationists like you propose as the meaning of biological evolution.
1	Well, considering how there is no such thing as a evolutionist...how is out of Africa wrong when the oldest human bones are found in Africa and get progressively younger across the world with the youngest bones being found in Northeast America?
0	The desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense. They're so impotent in their abilities to get tough on criminals, they feel it necessary to go after the most unrelated sources to try and make themselves look big and busy.  Why not just build a big wall to cut itself off from the rest of the world, and set up high security check points so cars coming and going can be checked to ensure no contraband is being smuggled in.

The phone calls and threats would yield 20 years...  and posting on craigs list, leaves a trail...

1	Why is that a good reason for this sort of law? What's the sense in removing the rights of citizens just to make a cop's job easier? Do you also support repealing the Fourth and Fifth Amendments (or the Canadian equivalent, if they have it), just to make cops' jobs easier? Allowing cops to use torture in interrogations would also make their jobs easier. Would you support that?
1	Assuming this right exists....you could say that you have no right to kill it though, you can only try to starve it.-You have consented sex and get pregnant. The pregnancy is a direct consequence that was known when having sex.-You have consented to a stranger coming into your house to eat dinner. The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner. -If you say you don't want the unborn to "live off you" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.-You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave.
0	Not at all. Your answers were without content or meaning. There was no sarcasm. You snipped most of my remarks because you were unable to address them. You have no answers and have been reduced to insult. That means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost. Otherwise you would attempt meaningful answers. You have made yourself a fool with nothing but names and insults.
1	What makes you think I am using “them” as a source? I would suggest you read the story you “read about” again. It is Nathanson, not “people”, who makes the claim. However saying someone lied and proving that they did are two entirely different things. Nathanson said they lied…he hasn’t proved it as such.Secondly, the figures you speak of that were supposedly based on lies is only exclusive to after the 1950s. We are talking about the 1930s. Lastly, using figures after the 1940s is highly skewed; therapeutic abortion was pretty much Roe v Wade lite and eliminated the use of criminal abortion in the middle and upper classes. Now, lets get to the facts. Our overall abortion rate was 22.9 in 1996 according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. In 1930, Hamiliton published the rate of abortion in 1930 in specific social and economic groups in, “Some Sociologic and Psychologic Observations on Abortion.” The abortion rate in those of the upper/middle class was 24.3, for poor unmarried white women it was 64% and for minorities the abortion rate was 40%. So women were aborting probably about a third of their pregnancies in the 1930s. Stix’s, “A Study of Pregnancy Wastage” puts the abortion rate at 35 percent or 35 abortions per 100 live births. 
1	But what is adultery?  Mark 10:11:  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.  Matthew 19:9:  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance. According to Mark, all putting away is adultery, but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him. Which is it?
1	Tell me, how does a link to a religious nut who thinks the New Testament was first written in Aremic , despite tons of evidence to the contrary, have anything to do with refuting the scientific theory of evolution?
1	I'm not sure what the means. I think that you have been listening to the creationist version of evolutionary biology. As an evolutionary biologist I've never heard anything like that.
1	Are you sure? Use your google.
1	And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.
1	Another personal favorite of mine... When I showed up to a seminar hosted by a local creationist, I challenged him to produce a textbook with false evidence. He couldn't. When I brought every last biology and biochemistry textbook from my college career to him for him to scour, he didn't even bother to look.Translation: this claim is XXXX, and Wells knows it.

And that this vessel was also large enough to carry a supply of food adequate for so many hundreds of millions of animals? And that the waste disposal systems were adequate to handle such a volume of waste?  I'm sorry, but anyone with even a shred of credibility must take the story of Noah and his ark as nothing more than an interpretation and adaption of an ages old story. To interpret it as the literal truth is beyond belief.

0	For someone who believes the following: "One cannot/should not/ought not to force their own personal moral beliefs onto others," it is indeed ridiculous to try and tell somone else: "You cannot/should not/ought not to force your own personal morals on people." To do so would be to force a personal moral belief onto somone else, which would render the statement absurd.I'm not exactly sure what you mean when you say "the whole moral thing," but I doubt it breaks down. Because there are people who hold the position that one can force morality onto someone else, even if only in certain circumstances, it is the case that somebody's moral belief(s) will be forced onto someone else.
0	So the "Origin of Species" has more information for theistic evolutionists than the Bible does??  Does theistic evolution believe in Satan?
0	Damn fine job!
0	This makes more sense then anything else I've heard on this thread.
1	Because there is no reason to do so.
1	I'll address the later question. They may not "need" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't "useful", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case.
1	And he's out!  By the way, why did you say "strike III" and not "strike 3"?

0	I know that. It was not my intention to show that a deity does not exist; I wanted to refute the fundamentalist interpretation (again).
1	And so, your goal is not to reduce abortions? Your goal is to educate people on sexual activity and pregnancy?
1	I think you present a good point, but part of the test here is to see how my post is reponded to; silence from certain people tells us things in inself.So far it seems my initial estimation of the issue is about right- the idelogy being upheld helps some people ignore the effect the punitive policy imposes.

1	And that's when her career and popularity took a nosedive.  Now that she's no longer playing the activist, she's becoming popular again.
1	Then by your own admission the OT is irrelevant to todays standards?  All I know is that the bible is being used as a weapon against my people by people who only believe the bible is the  LIVING WORD of GOD  when it is convenient. They igonor certain parts they consider irrelevant to their modern lives while adhering to the other parts as the literal truth, without taking the whole book into historical and cultural context. Either the bible was written for a certain time and place or all, and I mean all, is the literal  LIVING WORD of GOD . It can not be both.
0	Well, that just struck a chord with me. People of both sides say, ?We got the facts! The facts support our side!? but it isn?t about the facts but how we react to them.
0	Oh, well, that convinces me.
0	More evidence of your selfish motives, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it sort of disqualifies you from being objective and reasonable about the abortion issue. Its obvious if you were in the fetus' position, you'd be against abortion. I seem to detect a lot of abiguity and contraction on where you stand on this
1	Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?

0	I will answer the remainder later as I am pressed for time. Archaeopteryx is not a transitional form. It has well defined feathers. Where is the evidence for transition from scales to feathers that is predicted by evolution. Natural selection in particular but overall evolution. If you read Gould's original work he does not say what he says above and in fact actually contradicts it. It appears like a response that is back peddling at best. As I said, more later.EF

0	If full human life with total equality begins at conception, and you don't include the knock-on effects on other people, just considering killing as a simple evil in itself, killing the fertilized eggs is worse. But the individual act of killing a Jew is not as bad as the act of torturing someone to death.
1	Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?
0	And how many murderers have got away with it because they lured their victim to their home? And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing. I'm glad I live in a civilised country where the aim is to avoid people getting killed.
1	Well, I was just giving a different perspective from a witness who was also there, so obviously not everyone sees the events the same way. The thing is though, if they were booting people for being biased against the movie, or because they would object to it's message, it stands to reason they wouldn't have let anyone in PZ Myer's party in as well. And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe. It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie. Furthermore, if the producer deliberately started a discussion, then it only further stands to reason he didn't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie.

0	I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.  Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation.

1	There is a big difference between the quality of life and the sanctity and dignity of life. Not everyone has the same quality of life, this is obvious. However, every human has the same basic dignity that is bestowed upon the human race. What makes each person valuable is not stuff. They are valuable because they are human.
1	But how is homosexuality wrong?
1	Minor quibble. Omnipotence merely means that a being is capable of all things. It states nothing about how awkward or difficult these things are. Making a galaxy may require some serious brainsweat, whilst making a person may not...Anyway, besides that I agree with you!

1	Let's be honest, it won't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment. The 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us. It may seem like we don't need that now but one day it really might come in handy and people shouldn't forget that.  I still think incorporation is a load of BS though...for any amendment. Damn you 14th amendment!

1	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality.

0	I can see what you are saying. It's pretty much true...being a Jewish homosexual, I know it first hand. But just for once, couldn't they pick on somebody else?  It seems almost like a bully tactic for the Christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who doesn't have a legal leg to stand on...that's sad.
1	Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
0	To be honest I wouldn't mind too much missing old age...(whenever that starts).
1	I think that Believer may be referring to microbe to man evolution (i.e. simple life to more complex life). Your definition is not entirely accurate and misleading. By this, massive ammounts of new information must be added to the genome of the microbe to get it to "evolve" to a human, about 999 books each consisting of 500 pages fine print of information must be added to change a microbe to a human. That's a lot of information isn't it? Now where does all that information come from? It can't come from a Creator, there's no Creator according to atheistic evolutionism. Evolutionists say that this new information comes from accidental changes in the DNA when the information is being copied, these acidents are called mutations. Is this true though? Do mutations produce the new information required by microbe to man evolution? Dr Lee Spetner, an Israeli biophysicist says that there is not one mutation that one can point to that on the molecular level can be seen to increase the information in the genome. They actually all turn out to reduce the information in the genome. Let's take the example of the Totally Naked Rooster, the TNR mutant. What has the mutation done? It has obviously destroyed the information for making feathers. Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation? From the point of view of the chook farmer, probably yes, because no feathers - no plucking required. But what about from the point of view of the rooster? Well, he's going to freeze in winter and fry in summer, not much of an improvement for the rooster. This mutation has destroyed the information for making feathers. It can also be shown that anti-biotic resistance is the result of an information losing mutation, and many other evidences of evolution in action are also the result of information losing mutations - which matches perfectly with the creationary model, i.e. varriation within a kind. See, evolution can cope with the occassional down-hill mutation, but they really need a lot and a lot of up-hill, information gaining mutations if they are going to change a reptile into a bird, for example, and change a microbe into a human over eons of years. The problem is, we just don't see these information gaining mutations occuring at all today.Now natural selection is also supposed to be the hero of the plot to, right? Well, actually, natural selection also results in a loss of information for a certain population. We'll take the example of a population of dogs that are taken to a very cold environment with varrying fur (or hair) sizes. The population consists of the following fur sizes:LL - Long fur.Ll - Medium fur sizes.ll - Short fur sizes.where L = long fur gene, and l = short fur gene.Obviously, the cold will kill of those dogs that are not fit to handle the cold whether. The poor dogs with short fur sizes would be the first to go, then followed by the medium fur sized dogs - that makes sense doesn't it? Take them to a place like Antartica. Over short time, only the dogs with long fur sizes would survive. Our surviving population consists of the following fur sizes:LL - Long fur.We started off with a or variety of fur sizes in the population, but, as you can see, the short haired gene was eliminated from the environment by natural selection. Thus the population has lost information. So natural selection does not add information to the population, it erases information that disadvantages a population from living in a certain environment, such as the short haired gene (l) in this case.Hence, neither mutations nor natural selection adds any new information to the genome.

On the other hand, the problem is largely self-limiting, since the cretinous owner either dies or hopefully learns from their stupidity once they recover from their injuries. emoticonXGood
1	Walking-fish:  A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating. They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable. Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth, such as Robt Gentry's Polonium halos, rate of decay in the earth's magnetic field, rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth. This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates. Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries. So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands, hire a young earth creationist.
1	Most times children have been shot simply for living in a neighborhood with active gangs. Sometimes on the street, sometimes through the wall of their homes. Unintended targets often but also intended but without cause.  I live in Los Angeles.

0	Is it possible for an omnipotent being to have a definable 'image'? I guess the stock answer is 'yes, He made us in it', but that's somewhat... unsatisfying.  Are you implying that God is a hetrosexual?
1	Legislating against abortion is DEFINATELY NOT the way to go. If you think that will stop it (I'm not sure if you are but that's what it sounds like in this post) then you are delusional. Ever heard of the Prohibition (18th amendment)? I think that that case clearly shows the furility of legislating against something like this. Outlawing abortion will not reduce the amount of women who become pregnant and have abortions, it will just make having abortions more dangerous for them when they have to go to back-alley clinics and such to get the procedure done.
0	Did contraception fail? In other words, maybe a difference between your situation and mine is that I was not intending to have children and took appropriate steps that failed.And I wasn't just vomiting, that would've been cake. I did the right thing.
0	This applies only when men strive...that is fight. If a man  Accidently  hits a woman while in a fight and causes her to lose her child then all he has to do is pay a fine. But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed. Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents.
1	Bertvan: Perhaps Dr. Pigluicci doesnÂ’t see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system. Most people do see a difference. The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable. On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as Â“temperature and embryonic dietÂ” might cause proteins to fold differently and thus Â“whip upÂ” complex systems such as Â“eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shellsÂ” .

1	So tell me....knowing that the human race is 99.9% the same, and that  No matter how scientists today scrutinize a person's genes, they can't determine with certainty whether an individual is from one  racial  group or another ....how can you justify how the racist scientists can hold up a skull and make judgements about it? How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes? How can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different  species  based not on their genes -- which are 99.9% similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull? Evolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing, monkey-loving, chance-worshipping, racist fools.
1	Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring. If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before. 
0	I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.  Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation.
1	Doesn't matter? If you're still on your straw man, whatever, if you are referring to an individual pharmacists not servicing based ON religion (Which is the case in many instances), then it's in black and white as against the law.  Regarding firing, if it's not in the press or if it's good/neutral press sure, some minority groups don't get equal treatment under the law, that's nothing new to America. Yet if it's national bad press that builds up, no, businesses distance themsleves from such nonsnese. They have on gay rights/health benefits, they will on drugs. Their business is to serve customers, not to promote religious mumbo jumbo. A few companies may indeed choose to not carry, who cares, that's your straw man. I'm talking about individual pharmacists in the large chains (wal mart, grocery stores, etc.) making a choice based on discrimination, refusal to service an individual.
1	Religious institutions are now able to define marriage as they wish. For example, they need not recognize divorce or inter-faith couples, or even couples deemed to be incompatible by the religious official for any reason. The same is true of there not being a requirement to marry same-sex couples. Polygamy is a different topic, because it is not just unrecognized legally, polygamy is illegal.  Couples who married at city hall, before a JP, because they are non-religious, and it was important to them to not have a religious ceremony, will no longer be able to use the term.  Why is there a desire to get rid of state-recognized marriage now, at the possible prospect of the state recognizing a same-sex couple in marriage?
1	Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.
0	well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo
1	No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time.

1	Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.
1	Well, it does say on the site "Any concealed handgun permit holders who are eventually acquitted of their alleged crimes are not included in the tallies maintained on the site although the facts surrounding the shooting are detailed."So if you go to their pdf file you can still find out details about the very few cases that were acquitted or dismissed:http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/ccwtotalkilled.pdf

1	Way back when I was an undergraduate my professor of evolutionary biology told us about a careless zoo keeper that put polar bears and brown bears in the same pen during a remodeling. The result was a litter of hybrid offspring. It seems that polar bears and brown bears are perfectly interfertile. Not only that, it has been shown that the offspring are also interfertile with either species. DNA analysis has been able to distinguish brown bears from polar bears except in the case of the brown bears of the ABC islands. They are indistinguishable from polar bears.  And yet, even if a brown bear where white or a polar bear were brown, they are so obviously different in morphology that they would be classified as separate species. The differences go far beyond color.

1	12 dead, 31 wounded in Fort Hood shooting  Slain suspect at Texas base reportedly identified as Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan  © 2009 WorldNetDaily  An Army soldier opened fire at Fort Hood in Texas, killing 11 soldiers and wounding 31, before he was killed by a local police officer.  The Army identified the suspected gunman as Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan. A local radio reporter said Hasan is a Muslim convert.  Retired Maj. Gen. Robert Scales told Fox News the massacre did not appear to be the act of a mentally ill or extremely stressed person.   This was a deliberate act of execution,  he said.  The shooter was immediately killed, according to Lt. Gen. Bob Cone, a base spokesman, and two additional suspects, also soldiers, have been apprehended.  One incident, at about 1:30 p.m. Central Time, took place at a medical processing center, a second took place at a theater on the base, Lt Col Nathan Banks at the Pentagon told the Associated Press.  The base, about 60 miles from Austin, and two area school districts are on lockdown.  Greg Schannep, an aide to U.S. Rep. John Carter, said he was on the Army post to attend a graduation service, the Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported. As he neared the entrance of a building where the service was being held, he said, a soldier with blood on his uniform ran past him and said a man was shooting.  Schannep told the paper the shootings appeared to have occurred in a complex near the theater where the service was scheduled.  CNN reported President Obama has been advised of the shooting. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president is being kept updated. CNN said staffers have gathered in the situation room, possibly as a precautionary measure since details are still emerging.  The FBI reportedly was en route.  Sgt. Major Jamie Posten of the Fort Hood public affairs office said shooting took place  near the soldier readiness processing center, where soldiers cycle through as they prepare to deploy.   Posten said soldiers go to the center up to 60 days before deployment to begin the process of vaccinations and other preparation.   It's still developing. We're trying to figure out what took place on the ground,  he said.  Fort Hood, home to at least 4,929 active duty officers and 45,414 enlisted, is the largest U.S. military complex in the world. Another 9,000 civilians work on the base.  More to come ...  12 dead, 31 wounded in Fort Hood shooting

1	Well nothing at all in the program about the MORI poll, but instead a focus on four prominent figures of ID movement (Johnson, Dembski, Behe, Meyer) and their role in the development of the position over the last two decades.  I think the program makers granted the IDists a remarkably prominent platform on which they could present their views- which they did with a typical evasion of their religious motivations by avoiding any reference to Christianity and trying to present themselves in the guise of scientists (which is true for Behe but not the others.)  Countering their contributions were Dawkins, Attenborough and Miller. Dawkins was typically dismissive of the validity of ID and to the point about the intelletual dangers it poses, Miller countered the arguements of irreduable complexity and the alleged mathematical improbability of evolution and Attenborough made some more reservedl but no less powerful observations on the true nature of the fundementalists agenda.  This was against the backdrop of material on the Dover trial and some stuff on the Vatican's outlook on ID. As often happens with a popular science program examining a contentious issue very little science was examined at all, which is a shame as it is through such analysis that ID is exposed as the pseudo-science it truely is. Also, while the program tried to be impartial it gave considerable interview time to the ID group which failed to convey the weight of opinion against them in mainstream science.  Overall an interesting watch, but a bit of a PR coup for the IDists, IMO.

1	Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter.  Run a google search for  man shoots self  the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny. Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though.
1	Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.
1	Under interracial marriage, no black person was prohibited from marrying either.  Should people have been satisfied with interracial couples being classified as  civil unions ?  Today, we recognize that racism is wrong.  Yet some people still persist with homophobia. They fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend.
1	yes, and we could regress infinitely here. i'd say well they developed from basic nervous cells near the skin surface, and youd say  well where did the nerve cells come from  etc etc. ulimately, we'd be back to square one: either they evolved from simple dna-type acid chains, or poof god did it. the existence of eyes actually doesnt make a great case for either argument

1	A lot of people say that Jesus is the son of God. Others say that Jesus was actually God Himself, who came to Earth. Whichever way is the real case, Jesus didn't need to carry anything, because God had the ability to wipe two cities off the face of the map by raining down fire and brimstone.  God has plenty of firepower at His disposal. And He never said  lay down and die because it's wrong to protect yourselves from harm. 
1	What we would need now is a reliable way to distinguish the honest people from the dishonest ones.
1	Again, you're going to have to explain what relevance the difficulties we have forecasting the behaviour of a complex, chaotic system has to the straightforward observation of galaxies. I mean, they're galaxies. Right there, in a picture in front of you. I'm struggling to understand what you think can have gone wrong :)Let's use the same kind of analogy you've employed. If I want to take a picture of a basketball, I can do that close up, right? But if I want to take a picture of 1500 basketballs, all spaced out, I have no option but to do so from further away. With a standard 28mm lens on a 35mm camera, and allowing 4 square feet of floor per basketball, I would need to be roughly 90 feet up in the air to fit them all in the frame.Now imagine I want to take that same picture with an extreme telephoto lens, equivalent to peeking through a dime-sized hole seventy-five feet away. In order to see all those basketballs through that hole, they're going to have to be a bit further away. Almost nineteen miles in fact.Now make them 1500 earth-sized planets. It's a straightforward scaling up of similar triangles: now I'd have to be almost 2,000,000,000 miles away. 1500 suns? 217,011,334,736 miles away. 1500 solar systems (just out to pluto, not including the comets)? 919,679,070,315,789 miles away, or 156LY. If we include the comets, that becomes 2,299,197,675,789,472,500 miles.But we aren't looking at basketballs, planets, or solar systems. We're looking at galaxies, giving us a whopping 145,473,622,268,931,148,838,190 miles or 24,746,725,672 LY. Now, that's actually rather more than the measured distance to those galaxies, mainly because I'm assuming they're all laid out flat. To get a more accurate estimate we need to think about looking through a 'cone' of space, with galaxies at different distances.But I dunno - maybe I'm just swallowing all this without really thinking about it ;)
0	The bombing a city in wartime, killing non combatants is  taking the life of a defenseless person . Do you regard it as murder?  The execution by the state of a convicted felon is  taking the life of a defenseless person . Do you regard that as murder?  Exceed the speed limit in your car and in the process collide with a child and their death will be  taking the life of a defenseless person . Have you murdered them?  If you say yes to all three, then you have an unusual idea of murder, but at least you are consistent. To not say yes to all three exposes you as a hypocrite who assigns the label  murder  to a human death as your personal moral whims take your fancy.  Person is a label that is and has been applied differently by different societies through the ages. I personally think it utterly inane to seek to apply the label to a fetus before it is around 3 weeks old for example. The case for applying the label then steadily grows as the fetus grows. Assuming it develops normally, by birth it's definitely deserving of the label.

If you end up getting shot, as you walk towards that light remember you had ample opportunity to have prevented the dire mess you may find yourself in! It was not the guns fault, heck it really was not your brothers fault... It would have been your fault because you failed to act. This line has nothing to do with my position on guns or trying to get a "one up" on the debate. You are in a dire LIFE THREATENING emergency much worse than me owning every mortar, grenade, f16, m16, ak-47 in the world. Do you get it?
1	No. That's the hypothesis. A theory has been tested. That means that from the hypothesis a prediction is made that has the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, the prediction must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.  From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory.

1	Well nothing, other than the fact that I don't believe it to be true!  But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.  I don't see why not, it appears the most logical explanation to me.  You are right, it's not a nice thought. But then again little in life is. Why should this be any different?
1	True. There's the interpretation that assumes the outcome and then looks for evidence disregarding all that doesn't agree. And then there is the interpretation that looks at the evidence and then makes conclusions based on that evidence.You abide to assume the outcome, look for evidence. And you have constantly asserted with absolutely no evidence, that your religious interpretation is correct. Essentially you are soapboxing as nothing you've said has any empirical basis whatsoever. 
1	I would agree, except that there are situations where the data supports two ideas. If it appears to support both ideas equally, what do you do?

It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY  gay marriage  country. It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries, but that's it.

1	Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes. However   Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control  did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell.
1	Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.
1	But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought. I have read some discussion about various other possibilities. Maybe several forms of life arose in various environments. Eventually they then had to compete for resourses and all but one went extinct. And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population. The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms.  That isn't apparent from the abstract. And I'm not in a position to  purchase  the full article.  Right. We don't know. But it does appear from the universality of the genetic code that all life had a common ancestor. Of course, since you understand evolutionary theory, you are aware that the common ancestor is a population of reproducing organisms.  Exactly. What are you debating? Are you arguing that several identical genetic codes arose more than once?  I'm not sure of your point. So the first  event of compartmentalisiation  went extinct because of excessive ultraviolet exposure or the like. No one is claiming that the first reproducing molecule is the origin of all life. What is claimed is that all life is descended from a single ancestor.
1	The instinct for self-preservation is certainly present in all of us, and sometimes works against the society as a whole. I have seen it postulated in another discussion I had on this topic that government evolved as a mediator between these two biological imperatives. I like this theory.
1	How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?
1	I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?

Choosing to kill someone is a choice, but it is not a choice that should be legal. Therefore, you are forcing your view of  choice  on me by making abortion (murder) illegal.

0	Well, considering that quote comes from somebody whose throat I would just as soon slit as have come within ten feet of my child, it means nothing.
1	yes. and in the  middle-ages  roughly 80-90% of the world believed in superstition, black-magic, and myths. knowledge based on facts do not change, but such built on unproven and untestable believe usually does
1	Theropods had hollow bones like birds. It was "developed to be lighter[sic]."
1	But they didn't have sexual relations. This was from a sperm bank- there was nothing that made the two people create one being. Nonetheless, this is a side issue for future debates. My main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government shouldn't be condoning. The government obviously doesn't condone pedophilia, poligamy, and incest. Why is the government condoning homosexuality?
1	So it's shifted from  no new structures  to  I can think of a structure that can't evolve.  Me too. Evolutionary theory says that some things are not possible to evolve. But new structures, as you learned, do evolve.
0	Too late for that. The rest of us will stand for the right of that child to live and will convict and imprison you if you harm it. That'll be nothing compared to the fate that awaits you once you get to prison.
1	...or facts ;)
1	And it was. Anybody with a brain can understand that. Mayor Daley is white. A large portion of the Chicago population is black. Ergo Daley was keeping the blacks unarmed and helpless.
0	So your answer is to just continue with the way things are now: continue forcing the law-abiding to go unarmed and let only the shooter have exclusive access to guns so they can kill all they want? How many unarmed people have to be killed in a  gun free zone  before you come to realize that mandating unarmed and helplessness will do nothing to save even a single life?
1	I agree, that is one very important question the article does not address. I've not been able to Google any answer either; perhaps it is something that is undisclosed.
0	What else can you expect from a place like California?
1	Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?  I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.
0	I don't see anyone without healthcare. None of my friends, none of my family, none of my neighbors. ZILCH. NADA. NAUGHT. CIPHER. Now I don't go wandering around the inner cities looking for half-crazy winos and crack addicts either, so maybe that's why. 
1	So religion must be systematically abandoned and eradicated, not completely, just enough to be out of the public and political realm, leaving atheism as king. It’s not my pet theory that evolutionists are saying that, it’s a fact that they are saying that. 
1	The source I cite is a Japanese Admiral who survived WW2, who took part in December 7. Those were his exact words, "We were not fools to step in quicksand". Meaning the officer was quite aware of civilian owned guns and yes they were afraid of grannies point shotguns out of kitchen windows. In China were there are no guns, the army was quite comfortable to rape and kill women and children at will. Iraq is handing the 82nd Airborne thier hinnie as we speak. The militia is not going to stand head to head on a battlefield. That is the job of the standing army, not the militia. The civilians and irregulars in Iraq are doing EXACTLY what the militia will do in the USA agains a forgein invader. If you haven't noticed more solidered have been killed from the irregualrs than on the battlefield. Sorry for the slow response I have been trying to prevent the homeless from freezing on the streets at night. I would not be going into the places where the homeless frequent at night if I did not have a gun. So there is one more reason why I carry a gun, to protect me while I save the homeless on the street.
1	I suggested nothing. You are reading into this some thing that is absent. "The nurse then informed me, if I had answered yes to any of the questions, I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security. Looks like they are going after us vets."
1	I think bringing  emotions  into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.  Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to  non-belief  would be irrelevant (and irrational).
1	Recent news about an old theory. This is, of course, and example of macroevolution that is not the accumulation of small genetic changes of microevolution.  Mysterious microbe retrofits itself with plant  Flagellate might be study in evolution  But ender_krum's difficulty with micro and macro evolution is quite understandable. I can well understand how someone can jog to the end of the block, but are they not, after all on the same street? What I can't understand is how someone can finish a marathon. It seems impossible that lots of little steps could carry anyone that far.
0	And how did the Wise Creator come into existence? All that wisdom and creativity cannot come to existence accidentally or spontaneously...
1	It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific.
0	YOu know this how? Because I didn't post in those threads (mainly)? If you check my posting style I tend to weigh in when I think something needs to be said. Other than that I generally just read without comment. I seem to recall commenting on your style of summing people up at range before....
1	You wanna compare foreign nations even though no two stats are comparable or similar? Fine, let's look at China and their rising gun crime.
0	I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant?That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony! emoticonXGood
0	GREED but what you fail to admit is that that standard of living comes at a price for someone.
1	So you must be against Medicare and Medicaid. I assume you would also be against nationalized healthcare.  The government, rather the supreme court dictators, became involved in the woman's body in 1973. You must be against roe v. wade.
1	Utter XXXX. Doctors will regularly provide advice on lifestyle changes to those at risk of a variety of diseases and conditions, contact information as to where they can find support in making those lifestyle changes, and if appropriate refer them to psychologists to assist them in making those changes. Dentists will give long lectures on the evils of eating sugar and suggest appropriate snack replacements for sugary foods.What else does "walking the walk" entail? Should the "medical establishment" follow their patients around and forcibly prevent them from having a lifestyle they believe to be harmful?
1	I think you're over-complicating the anti-choice position. A majority of anti-choice posts I've read are essentially based on their 2000 year-old mythical belief system, when women were not considered a particularly valuable portion of society for tasks other than child bearing and scullery purposes. Unless, of course, capable of immaculate conception, still unproven, yet enjoying dogmatic status. If you refute those mythical beliefs, regardless of any country's constitution, to those posters you're actually less than a piece of real estate and definitely non-human, male or female.
1	Well, there are several problems with your post. 1) You misunderstandthe term 'THEORY' when applied to scientific theory's. A theory isa model to try to explain the FACTS. WHen it comes to evolution, thetheory of evolution is a model to try to explain the observed fact thatevolution happens. Second of all, Humans and modern apes share the same ancestor. Froma biological point of view, humans ARE apes that have a specialised brain.The third problem is many religious people take much of the bible as allegorical. That means they are able to reconcilate such things asscientific fact, (evolution, expanding universe, age of the universe, biology, geology and physics), and their belief in God.
1	I will let Peeling address this. But seriously, do you truly believe that scientists are this great cabal whose ultimate purpose is to steer the political process in a more liberal direction? To what end? Are conservatives more unwilling to fund science, is that your point?
1	I find this a fairly accurate summation of the goal of HitlerÂ’s Â“final solution.Â”  Of course, Brady, you offer no evidence of how widespread individual firearm ownership became in the 5 years before Hitler Â“rose to powerÂ” when it became legal to possess firearms again. One would think that your argument would have at least considered this factorÂ—but I wonÂ’t fault you because all you have done is borrowed an un-sourced argument.  Brady, this is just more cut and paste, this time largely from the website guninformation.org. For example, the statement
1	Nope. Chemical evolution has nothing to do with life. It has to do with changes that chemicals undergo when combined under certain conditions. The science of the origin of life is called abiogenesis. Life is a precondition of evolution. If you wish to claim that "POOF - my god did it" is the source of that life, then that doesn't argue for or against evolution.[quote]3. Biological evolution, explains how a single-celled creature could evolve into the range of creatures we observe today by naturalistic means (evidence for this: transitional forms - if I am wrong, then why is the transitional fossil argument still used by many evolutionists?).[/qote]While you claim to be seeing the big picture, you actually have a very restricted idea of evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequencies of alleles in a population over time. Unless you can apply that to the big bang, changes in chemicals, and even the origin of life, you are not talking about evolution. You are trying to apply your misunderstanding the the science of biology. You are demanding that you should be able to define what biologists mean by the vocabulary they use.
1	Well... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.  We're waiting to hear about three or four more.  As for the nature of marriage, it is both a legal contract and (sometimes) a religious ceremony (sacrament in some religions). We're stuck with the duality, whether we like it or not, and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect. Different religions can do what they want.
0	Where do you get that impression from?
1	Really? When? I have talked to many an Aussie who do martial arts and THEY aren't even allowed to get a permit to teach with swords as they to Have the wrong hands
0	secularism is a religion based upon faith and I was speaking to simone. what is your religion?
1	'Nephilim' and 'giants' are usually interchangeable. The sons of Anak are indeed said to be descendants of the Nephilim and some of the Philistines were indeed said to be sons of Anak (notably Goliath).
1	i didnt mention good anywhere in my post  this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic
1	That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.
1	Yes, this is what I'm saying.  The  soul  and the  spirit  are the whole point of the bible's existence.  if it can't be plain about what they are and what to do with them,  then either god is a terrible author,  or (and this is the one you'll like) we are terrible readers.  Either way, god isn't making the instructions very clear.
0	Thats not the point. The Pro-lifers advocate force, just like the slave advocates did. The pro-choicers advocate freedom and choice, just like the abolitionists.
1	Actually, you make it clear that it is fair.
0	Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.
1	You have ignored a third option, my denier of all that is right and good. That third option is the one you atheists and secular humanists refuse to consider, and that is that God spoke the stars into creation at the same time as Genesis says He spoke everything into existence in 6 days time as Genesis declares. What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive. It is like saying that because you reject the gospel of Jesus as I accurately and honestly share it with you, that it is me lying about that gospel because you have rejected it. It is the most irrational and dishonest reasoning possible, yet it defines the way your minds work. emoticonXDonno
1	Wrong. It was Lemaitre who proposed the big bang theory, although it wasn't called that at first.
0	Oh! I get it! abortion is fun, it is only a traumatic experience (to kill your unborn son/daughter) for "unbalanced" women emoticon_xagree
0	And well he should have ignored it. Your analogy is nonsense.
1	And lets ont forget the parts where they didn't completely relabel all of the creation to ID and we ended up with "Cdesign proponentsists"
0	It's a self-defeating question. You're asking why numbskulls participate in numbskullery.
1	Actually, that's not true. The standard upon which the  super accurate atomic clocks  are based is slightly different from the actual rotation of the earth. It is as if you had two clocks that kept time slightly differently. I have to adjust the time on my grandfather clock all the time - every time I raise the weights I reset it to the correct time. It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works. It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week. I'm still adjusting.  That's what is happening with the  leap seconds  that occur from time to time. The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times, one of which is very accurate, the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year.
1	Perhaps you should go get a bit of education on the subject bud - embalming is not fossilization, nor are they comparable.........
0	You can believe it all you want...If you don't believe in abortion and you don't believe in any kinda of birth control then that is your belief...it doesn't contradict itself.
1	Unfortunately the gun control freaks never stop until all are totally enslaved. They never cease with their stupidity. One need only look at the gun control crowd's wet dream, jolly old England. Even when they get kicked out of political power their laws remain to be added on to once they return to power.
0	Well, I guess you're entitled to your opinions. On the gun-control board, I imagine you might encounter a lot of rednecks- not the best specimen of our poplulation.
1	Well, that's generally true of any process that uses energy. Some is wasted.
1	It's quite obvious that it's the ID proponents who have issues with definitions, particularly among themselves. Behe has changed his own definition of IC, and Dembski changed Behe's definition of IC.
1	Private property rights are the most fundamental of all rights and the basis for any government at all. When a society ignores those basic rights it ceases to be civilized and diminishes to tyranny, anarchy and crime. Previous societies have always used criminals to encroach on property rights and deprive the people of fundamental rights of any kind. When people cease to have dominion and exercise rights to protect that property by any means possible there is tyranny. There is no rule of law in the UK any more.  BRITAIN is there! Proud to have broken those ties back in 1776
1	You realise I'm talking about if the burglar is running away, not the householder, right? Looking at it again I realise I may not have phrased it clearly enough. I'm saying that some of those  violent  crimes may simply have been burglars pegging it when disturbed.
0	Nothing that prevents it communicating in theory, but I have covered the communication aspect already in this post. The idea that we are 'image bearers of the divine' comes purely from human religions, and has no concrete basis. The atoms in my body were created by nuclear fusion in the centres of stars that exploded billions of years ago. Rather than being imago dei, we are stardust. I find that idea far more grandiose and appealing than divine providence.I'm sure you'll have more questions!Anyone else got more than a trite one-liner on their idea of God (or whatever you think he/she/it is)?
0	Have you lost your mind? I got no idea what you are talking about.
1	You've asked a good question cash, the way you know that is by all of the excuses you're getting rather than any attempts to actually answer you directly with solid evidence. Of course we know that evidence doesn't exist, but they'll never admit that either. emoticonXGood
0	So what are you trying to do here - smother everyone with bafflegab ?
0	You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.
0	I think that environmental and political concerns should certainly take part in these decisions, though I will not go so far as to assign their importance. Yes, there should be freedom of choice, but should your choices infringe on another's? If we're talking in thirty feetses, sure as heck, i want you to stay out of mine! But there are always other circumstances. Should a wealthy landowner deeded with several acres be entitled to have as many kids as his land will support? maybe. Should a wealthy woman with tons of money be able to have as many kids as her pocket will allow? maybeBut on the other hand, should a poor woman without two red cents to rub together be required to abort her very loved and wanted child? probably not.
1	It seems in this case they used termination to get rid of dna evidence therefore allowing the stepfather to carry on abusing his step daughter.  The mother should be charged with destroying police evidence and accessory to the crime.
1	So if the laws didn't apply here because of it being a reservation, stricter laws would not change anything (unless ammended to apply). But even so, the killer would still have gotten the guns because the person he got them from had the right and duty to have them.
1	There is some truth here. Did you ever see "Independence Day"? They were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived. It didn't stop the aliens... sure only a film... let's look at real life...modern - Iraq - Sadaam gave guns out to the people just before Gulf War IInot so modern - Boer War - Dutch farmers in South Africa were all excellent marksmen - Britain still invaded.US Civil War - I believe that the Confederate States were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned. US still invaded.
1	That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.
1	You mean, intelligent design, which has been proven in court to be not science, and to be a front for certain religious agenda's, and straight forward arguments based on ignorance of the evidence and logical fallacies.If you look at the organizations that push I.D. , you will see they have a religious agenda . The discovery institute is funded by religious organizations, and every one of the board will admit they thing the 'intelligent designer' is the Christian god. Read the 'wedge strategy' from them.
1	Please stop making statements that have nothing whatsoever to do with the debate at hand. We're not talking about Christian fundamentalism and "reality".
1	It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small.  By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.

1	To step in for Duck,Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson's if he weren't the pope? We wouldn't. The whole point is that he is the pope. We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals. (By the way he's 84  years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly.) So we don't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson's. We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church.But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion:Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation. The unborn being is considered a child. Thus the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill" applies. Check out some of these verses as a start: Exodus 21:22-25, Psalm 139:13-16, Psalm 71:6, Deutoronomy 30:19, Luke 1:15 and 1:41, Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah1:5, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20  It is also of note that it was, in a sense, a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community. Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5, Matthew 18:10  (there are many other indications of this as well). An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset.The early Church also spoke out against abortion. Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject: http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp  Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture.In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity (including scripture), there are some essentials that must be noticed. The Bible unequivocally "tells" us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life. Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. Abortion supporters say, "This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me."Whereas, Christ says, "This is my body, which is given up for you." "This is my body"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die.
1	Though it doesn't really say why, the Bible says that is what will happen. See Matthew 7 :13,14. It's part of God's plan. Free will.
1	Then go study a course on geology. It is the entire science of geology that has completely disproven a YEC  literal  reading of Genesis. The Earth is old and there was no global flood a few thousand years ago.
0	Your continued comparison of a person exercising their constitutional rights, to engaging in deviant and possibly illegal sexual acts, has reached the point of intolerance, Smith. Every time you mention the word fetish, you're gonna be reported. So unless you wanna get banned cut it out.
0	And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.
0	** Meaning?!?!
1	If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?
1	Well, obviously the past few years of reading around the subject and quite a few more years of software engineering experience all contributed to this particular light-bulb clicking on, so I wouldn't read too much into the abruptness of the final epiphany :)
1	Okay.  The best succinct representation of the scientific method is probably circular:  We make an observation about what we see.  We form a hypothesis based on our observation.  We perform an experiment to test the hypothesis.  We make an observation about what we see (in the experiment).  Rinse and repeat...  Now add a spur: after repeated refinement and confirmation of hypotheses, a theory is devised.
0	What else is new?
0	my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.
0	Nor will there be economic upheaval if there isn't (though there will probably be some regardless soon). Honestly though, do you think you would care more if it were blacks or jews being killed rather than feti and embryos? I'd certainly hope so...if you condemn abortion clinic bombers you are setting a certain double standard. I just don't think that a potential person can ever outweigh the wants and needs of an existing one, and 99% of the time pro-lifers agree. Soon as you realise that its not actually 'babies' being aborted then its a lot harder I think to hold a universally pro-choice opinion
1	The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith.

0	She should not have the baby in the first place, and thats what im saying. The only irresponsible move a 12 year old would be making is not having an abortion, as she is not physically and emotionally capable of raising or bearing a child.
1	well said. i agree 100%
1	Well firstly we do not know that  volition  must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.
0	Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.  There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them.
0	In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use "his/her" or "he/she"... it just gets tiring after a while...)
1	Another relevant study:   Major findings: States with higher levels of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm homicide and overall homicide. This relationship held for both genders and all age groups, after accounting for rates of aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, urbanization, alcohol consumption, and resource deprivation (e.g., poverty). There was no association between gun prevalence and non-firearm homicide.  Publication: Miller, Matthew; Azrael, Deborah; Hemenway, David.

1	Oh, don't be so hasty :) Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work. So there's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism's physical form or abilities.

0	Uh... What? This sort of response could only be dreamed up by a religious zealot looking for a reason to oppose atheism. No atheist would ever respond with "I'm the God of my own universe."Further, the idea that "you have to have standards to these things or being an atheist is irrational" makes no sense. That sentence doesn't even mean anything at all.Unless this conversation was intended to show two people repeating nonsense to one another, it is useless.

1	Mythic nonsense? It's historical fact. Or are you one of those "The Holocaust never took place" people?
1	I dunno. Perhaps more loving familes to adopt parentless children? A larger tax base? Less disease transfer?  Silly me, I forgot, those are GOOD things!  The antis keep saying that gay marriage leads to bad things, so obviously I classified such outcomes as bad.
0	Yes, I remember, and I agree. Johnny was just primping for the cameras.  I do believe though that historically men have been vain and will continue to be so. Your expression of machoism in the toughness of your truck is just another vanity. Vanity can be expressed by the pride one takes in the amount of mud hanging on the four wheeler after a spin in the backwoods.  Face it, BO. You're just a vain man, such as I am.  Our quest to have the biggest, baddest truck on the block is not much different from a woman wanting to be the belle of the ball.  And often men express their vanity in the  possession  of a trophy wife.
0	But what would be the minimum for you to survive? Here I am getting at the essence of self. For example, if you went into a coma with severe brain damage such that your body was alive but you had no mental processes left - no thoughts, emotions, sense of pain, no mental processes whatsoever apart from brain function controlling your body (heart rate, etc.) - would "you" have survived? Or would "you" essentially be gone at that point?
0	Good for you!!!  Now stand aside for those who think otherwise.  We in the pro-choice camp salute and respect the choices you make; now we demand equal respect from you for the choice we make.emoticon_xangel
1	This seems to be the central argument: the article continues to give many examples of moral disapproval of neglecting or murdering your children. However, it ignores the fact that parenthood is a relationship which is not defined simplistically by genetic relation or by being in the womb (it is unclear if he thinks surrogate mothers should be able to have abortions).We can be prosecuted for neglecting an adopted child or step-child, or anyone we have parental responsibility for. On the other hand, if a person gives their child up for adoption then they cannot be charged with negligence if the child is deserted by its new parents.One interesting part:
1	Private practices, certainly. However, individual doctors at a hospital funded by and is provided for the general public or pharmacists should not be able to refuse to provide services that are part of their jobs. If their morals conflict with the requirements of the job then they should not have that job.
0	It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.
0	Well we assume a right to your own body here. It is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history.  I guess I don't agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them...if this is the standard then we are all in trouble.
1	**  Excuse me, walkingfish, for butting in, but I'd like to reiterate my point to schuster that Darwin's theory of  Natural Selection  is just an outgrowth of an ancient social rationalization for unequal distribution political/economic power and privilege, (that is, social elitism, aristocracy and racism), falsely and anthropomorphically applied to non-human life.
1	First of all why would you want to know if I have an alternative theory to one that is known to be false ? Are you found of false theories?A true theory would be a replacement not an alternative.The Wrong Answer Will Always Be The Wrong Answer! If evolution was true there would be overwhelming , uncontestable evidence, there is no uncontestable evidence. Little that is any more than pure imagination.Theories start out as hypothesis and are then subject to experimentation and observation. When they fail they are discarded. For instance spontaneous generation was disproved by Pasteur and discarded as a theory.Evolution which is not a theory ,although it is called one ,has been falsified nine ways to Sunday. Two of Darwin's own falsifications have come to pass and ignored. The Galopagos Finches have proven to interbreed which destoys a great deal of the so called basis of his theory. "Extinct" animals and plants are found alive and ignored as evidence against evolution. Theories are made to be challenged but evidence against evolution is suppressed.Evolutionist had to revive spontaneous generation although it is scientifically impossible because without it atheism is impossible. The atheist must have a story no matter how bizzare to justify his faith . Science suffers because of this.My theory is that this planet is exactly what Einstein said it was , a place designed by a Supreme Being to be inhabited by people.The evidence is creation itself. If there is a creation there must be a Creator. Nothing has ever been observed to self assemble and there is no known process that could accomplish that.Animals and plants just like the ones alive today have always existed. Many have gone extinct but death is not evidence of evolution.Human beings are incapable of creating a grain of sand from nothing.There are grains of sand so there is an intelligence greator than ours that did.The perfect balance seen in the anthropic principle tells of a Creator.The unbelievable complexity of the human body makes evolution impossible.DNA can not exist without proteins. Proteins are coded by the information in the DNA molecule. They had to come into being simultaneously.Pre-biotic natural selection is impossible , there is no process to affect the evolution of DNA outside of a living organism.To look at a building is to have absolute empirical proof there was a builder.To look at creation and say there was no Creator is to enter an intellectually free zone.
0	Well if they're automatic weapons then they're obviously importing them illegally from outside the country and violating federal regulations. You've got even bigger problems than you think.
0	So as a gay man I should be forced to accept hetero marriage. If I am forced to accept hetero marriage they should be forced to accept gay marriage. What part of equal protection do you not understand? I personally would like to see all displays of all religions wiped fron the public square. No one is going to dictate to me how to live my life based upon some outdated religious belief that I don't subscribe too.
0	if god exists then which of your senses detects this god??... surely if the human being was created by god then wouldnt at least one of your senses detect him?? I am not asking this question to aggravate anyone I just want to know the answer, although im sure it will.
1	Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.
0	How about people who don't live in a well-developed country? They can't get treatment for all of their diseases.
0	He's doing his best Jesus impression; remember when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the backs of two asses?
1	There was a break in a few miles away from my house last night. Will an anti-gunner please explain me, what my contribution to the crime was last night?  More guns more crime right? Then everyday I am encouraging more crime by carrying my gun? Very confused.
0	I'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm?  Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, I'm afraid boys will be boys.
0	Well you better hurry up. Aren't you like 113 years old or something? :)
1	The ID movements form of ID states that there are  large gaps  in the theory of evolution that can only be explained by the presence of a supernatural designer. Behe is happy to think that it is the christian god (like the rest of them), but they arn't allowed to say that, because if they do, they violate that annoying ammendment!  The ID argument is not scientific, because it's not falsifiable, and has no supporting evidence. The ID movement relies solely on LACK of evidence for evolution, which is complete bunk. Just because we don't know yet, it doesn't mean that godditit. (Incedentally, most of Behe's claims of  Irreducible Complexity  are already destroyed by science, as DamEtel will be more than happy to explain.)
1	Oh I quite agree. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to see it as such. I was admitting to those who don't that it does appear that God confirms their homosexual prejudices. To back Traveler up however, I don't buy the 'closet case' answer myself. People who are racist aren't secretly scared they are black, equally homophobes aren't necessarily closet homosexuals. Unfortunately such irrational prejudices just exist.
1	"What is true, Ricker says, is that gun manufacturers have long known that distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals, and yet gun makers deliberately look the other way. "The quote says it all. That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility. Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity.GM and Ford know that 100% of all the product they sell will be used illegally. Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits. No one obeys speed limts, the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching. Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products.Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility. When a customer breaks a law using a product, manufactures are not responsible, that goes for both guns and cars, or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes.There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA. They really should be working together. It takes two sides to make a conflict. The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers. NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that. That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF. The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries. The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals, but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity. Which is the position of every single product manufacturer not matter what you make and sell.It is not that gun manufactures are looking away, they do. So does every other manufacture who makes any other product.
0	Well, that's disappointing.  I though the congratulations were for me (17th wedding anniversary yesterday).  Okay, I suppose a woman's right to choose might be as important. Congrats!  Smiley
1	"According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, from 1997 to 1998 the nation's overall crime rate dropped 6.4%, from 4930.0 to 4615.5 crimes per 100,000 population. More telling is this continuing trend where crime fell faster in states that have strict carrying concealed weapons (CCW) laws or that do not allow the carrying of concealed weapons at all than in states which have lax CCW laws.""From 1992 to 1998 (the last six years for which data exists), the violent crime rate in the strict and no-issue states fell 30% while the violent crime rate for the 11 states that had liberal CCW laws (where law enforcement must issue CCW licenses to almost all applicants) during this entire period dropped only 15%."http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r...truth&menu=gvr
1	Well, if some of the implications of quantum theory are correct (and don't quote me on this), then some of those things are actually possible. However, as any scientist worth his/her salt will tell you, just because something is possible doesn't mean it's definite. I don't see any proof of those things happening any time soon, either, but they're fun to think about, aren't they?
0	OH FREE MARKET???? IM goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	.  This is the most obscene,disgusting and down right vilest thing i have ever had the misfortune to come across.Do you watch the news or read the papers,because it was all over the national news and the papers so much in fact that the goverment set up an inquiry,and a commitee to deal with it.  To say my sons body was salvage is bang out of order and i would thank you to think about the effect that your uncaring words have on people.  How long have been on this board,because it is all over the place that fishx{my wife} is staunchly pro life and it would of been more helpful for your case than asking such a stupid question as to ask if she had had an abortion.  You live in good old blighty and yet claim no knowledge of what was going on do you not remember alder hey childrens hospital.The system you are discussing is the same system that you live under,it was hope hospital in salford that took my babys body and never returned it.
1	Well, the simplest explanation often proves to be correct. I could give you examples, but I'm not sure you would pay attention.  Just to show I'm not bluffing: if you typed a paper while sleepy, went to bed, and woke up only to find errors in your paper, the best conclusion would be to assume that you made the mistakes, rather than that a hacker put them there. I expect that most times, there was no hacker. The explanation with fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct.  However, having all the information is important. If you later find out that a computer genius was submitting a paper to a contest that you were submitting yours to and that most of the other papers involved had many errors, the likelyhood of a hacker goes up.  Yes, I know that was a weird example. I only used it because there is someone who actually believes (according to rinkworks.com) that a hacker messes with her writing.
1	On the contrary, anyone who takes an interest in such things is well placed to appreciate just how hard it is to grasp such distances.
0	And amusingly enough, you who claim you don't have any interest in changing the outcome spend soooo much time posting on these threads... Perhaps that's another claim that's just false in your opinion? emoticon_rolleyes
0	The VPC is hardly a real source. If any thing what this shows is the real and pressing need to close the border. Splain exactly how they get up here to do the dastardly deeds. What is interesting is how many laws were broken to buy and get the weapons back into Mexico. Sounds like a problem with lax enforcement.  PS what exactly are  cop killer handguns  beyond an attempt to get the unknowing public aroused and enraged. The self same bunch of loons touted  cop killer  bullets and Hollywierd even jumped on the bandwagon with a movie. The only fly in the ointment was they couldn't trot out a single case when a LEO died from bullets penetrating the vest.
1	Yes, and their final report was essentially that, while they did not review every piece of data used in the book, every single piece that they did review had been falsified or tapmered with.
1	Not really when you consider the gun laws of the UK, and how they were changed to prevent incidents like Cumbria from ever happening.
1	**  As above, 'social classes' are 'populations', and modern darwinian evolution focuses entirely on the 'evolution' of 'populations', NOT individual organisms. Neo-Lamarkian theory focuses on individual, internally driven effort, instead of inherited advantage, which is the be-all and end-all of Darwinism, and of modern economic and political social theory. Just as it has always been.

0	Many Atheists I have encountered call God a human effort in wish fullfillment.  THat seeking God and salvation through Jesus Christ is an illusion.  Many of these folks are quoting Freud whether they know it or not.  Ha! In the end, he was a Theist!
1	Thanks. Well I'm a resident of California currently but my partner has orders to Virginia. If they allow outside residents to apply for a license we'll do it Considering DC is only a four hour drive or so.
1	Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   As if this should be any surprise. The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science.
0	First you yourself make a baseless comment saying "the amount of illegal abortions was not that many" then you suggest I need to disprove some baseless comment you previously made.I'm afraid I do not. As I said I try to take a world view -- America is a small place compared to the entire world.My comments are never reffering to America specifically unless I specify otherwise; I don't even live in America so it grates slighlty that I should have to make this point.
1	The original statement didn't address anything about the difference between a pre-birth and post-birth human. It was a reasonable statement that suggested that no human being should be discriminated because of their place of residence. I asked whether you really disagreed with the statement, and you respond here with your opinion on the matter of a difference between a pre-birth and post-birth human and the semantics of the word 'reside.'Your first opinion I can accept as your opinion, you are entitled to it.Your second statement can be taken to mean that someone in a coma on life support is not 'residing' in the hospital room on the bed linked to life-support equipment, but rather that they are physically attached to it for their very survival. Or that an Eskimo is not 'residing' in an igloo in the Arctic with -60F temps and windchills of over 100F below zero... but that they are attached to that igloo for their very survival. (Granted, the igloo example is a bit of a stretch, but I just wanted to take an opportunity to say that I built an igloo in my backyard. It's pretty cool!)
0	Actually you support "my choice" not. - For you see, your choice of the word BUT negates your words preceding it, for one.For two, your own lack-of-understanding is causing you to feel "disgust me, because I'm pretty sure" <-- what you said here, confirms the above. And Telling & transparent is: "So you saying "God" is against abortion, is the same as me saying "God" wants me to kill non-believers and adulterers."Annie: only by your twisted arguments. Your entire post here, is built on one false manipulation after another. And after you managed to get yourself into this fix, no wonder the above non-sense is the best you can come up with.
1	Following your link, Ive just been  visiting  the website of  Doctor  Hovind and his associates: I found it a lot of fun - a sort of Disneyland of  creationist science .  Of course the good  doctor  takes advantage of almost universal ignorance about the scientific foundations of evolution: this is a melancholy fact, and it takes the edge off the laughs I had.
0	That's like asking why do you get to choose what to do with your own hair or teeth, because it is part of YOUR body. Men have this right. Women have this same right.
1	You are arguing from US law, I am arguing from Australian law. I think I needed to state this at the beginning.  I have not heard of a US court case where a woman sued a hospital for bringing her back to life 'against her will'. Though in America, anything is possible  The oath of a doctor is to save a life. A woman who OD'ed would need to be saved.
1	Where'd you get the idea that Vitter was a Fundamental Christian? He's a Roman Catholic, just like Ted Kennedy. Does that make Ted a fundie, too?emoticon_confused
1	Wead my weply to wascally...Species evolve because the sequence and organisation of genes evolves. It doesn't take a vast amount of genetic change to evolve one species from another, but it does take genetic change, and molecular geneticists are currently mapping the sort of changes needed to alter rates and timing of gene expression.If you remove the genes from a cell that requires constant gene expression to function, it will cease to function. That's so obvious it doesn't need explicating. I do not see, hoever, how any of this can be used to make an anti-Darwinian case.Biologists already know there's more to evolution than Darwinian natural selection, hells bells, even Darwin knew that! There is nothing in theory to prevent autoregulatory gene networks that control their own expression evolving by natural selection. If there is, somehow every biologists seems to have missed it.
0	That's why I say, "Kill the bastard!"
0	Really! Will you grant me the same benefit? Lets just say I have no moral problem with physically hurting you. Would you suggest that people who think that is wrong should not impose their belief system on me? You would certainly think they should impose their belief system on me. Chances are you would say something like  well, I am a human so therefore I have certain rights  to which I would respond that chloe and I believe the fetus is a human and we believe you are a human too so therefore the same standard applies.  The argument about not pushing your beliefs on others just never works because every law is pushing beliefs on people.
1	I hate to break this to you but this is racked with illogic.Well, ok it's "logical" but the premises rely on things that are pure assumptions.Just because something can't be detected doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.And, of course, if god is god the way we think about it, then God is everywhere, including in this universe. He is the universe (but we can't detect him). Does he exist now or not?
1	I have had a quick glance over the article that you gave us on the link. That is strange that they claim that they have evidence that destroys Dr Russell Humphreys Relativistic Cosmology, when the AiG (a major creationist organisation) have stated that Dr Humphreys has thus far been able to solve the problem of distant starlight. If what you say is true, than most disturbing this is. I have sent an email to the editorial team at Answers in Genesis for their response. They should reply in a week or so. But the only thing that is different between the big bang and the new Cosmology is the starting assumptions, i.e. bounded and un-bounded universe.
0	Sorry, I shouldn't have jumped to that conclusion :( Sometimes this forum gets the best of me...sorry again.
0	And if the state decides to keep abortion legal? Then you don't care if these "gifts from God" have a chance or not?
0	So you're not wrong; everyone else is a liar.
1	Just have to say something on this. If the boy scouts didnt receive federal support and get special deals from the government then they would be able to exclude whoever they want. However since they often hold their meetings in public schools for free and rent public lands for discounted price or even sometimes for free they cannot discriminate against gays and atheists. So they have to make a choice.
0	Yes I exaggerate. As long a Americans who love freedom and have the means to protect it, you will never see the same oppressive taxation in Europe happen here.If Bellesiles is the poster boy for academia and socialism, then I rather not have utopia run by men like him.
1	Actually, Mega didn't make any claims. He just reposted an editorial.
1	If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work.
0	That analogy doesn't work here.It appears that your beef is with the prestige associated with being able to say "We're married." as opposed to recognizing yourselves as "same-sex couples with all the rights and privileges afforded married couples".The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation. A gay man can marry any woman that will have him. A lesbian can marry any man that will have her. You are not denied the right to marry...so long as you comply with the rules of marriage...including the one about one male and one female.Changing definitions just to satisfy the ego of any one group is patently ridiculous. One might ask why we can't call ourselves female when we are actually male or why males shouldn't be allowed to enroll in an all girls school.If it benefits you want, have at it. Work on Congress to come up with something like PACS.If it's an attack on the definition of marriage, then get lost.
1	Because you've presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals.  If you can't prove it's broken, you don't have grounds to call for fixing it.
1	To Close_slave_can:  May be  overall  was the wrong word to use. By this, I mean, the whole naturalistic explaination about our origins. We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from  simple  organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.  You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.  It is this that I am refering to. It is the interpretation about the origins of the evidence that all the debates in this forum are caused by. Sorry for any misunderstanding.
1	Well, a lightning bolt in generated by ice crystals in clouds building up charges and then discharging onto the ground.  As it happens most physicists I know are (a) quite skinny and (b) married
1	**  Like chemist and all other darwinists, you imply wherever possible. But in this case I broke my own best rule and replied to chemist, and was not speaking of you at all.  And you are right, the phenomenon of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, [inexplicable in darwinist mechanical terms], as discovered by Cairns, et al, in 1988, is a separate phenomenon from stress-stimulated somatic hyper-mutation. I misled you in the the quote you used to bring in the Cairns work--    Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.   That was not Cairns, but Barry G. Hall to whom I was referring, and he was a research prof at U. Rochester in the 90's who did work on adaptive mutation, wrt adaptive cellular responses in stressed eusocial bacteria colonies. That is, somatic hypermutation as a cellular,[in multi-cellular organisms, such as eubacteria colonies], adaptive, systemic and systematic [non-randon, non-stochastic, non-accidental] heuristic evolutionary mechanism.  He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.
0	Oh come on, Kronos. You know good and well that wasn't a statement meaning any-and-every in every instance.
1	Perhaps not,perhaps it should, if it can be shown there is no prior knowledge the two people have ever met.
1	The first problem would be finding a country where there has been a sucessful gun ban. As far as I know, every country on the planet experiences some violence related gun use, even the ones with draconian gun control laws. Even in te Soviet Union, where posession of illegal firearms could potentially lead to a death sentence, there was still shootings.
0	Good points IMHO. I think you are holding your own here. But I want to read your views on how your detailed analyses can make a real difference.  There are many with pre-conceived notions about evolution they learned in high-school, so changing opinions is not easy.  Your ideas would really be a help here.  Thanks
1	And it was not the 9th Amendment that the court has used to accomplish this. Rather, it is the 14th through various illegitimate legal doctrines such as incorporation and substantive due process.
0	And its all evolved via NDS - marvellous!
1	And why is that? Because the framers of our constitution felt that all white men were equal, the rest were property. It is this kind of ignorant and narrow minded thought that will have people rubbing their heads in 200 years, wondering why gays were ever treated as second class citizens who did not deserve the same rights given to straights.
1	So you’re saying we would not have clindamycin without the ToE? The ToE is supposed to be defined as changes in alleles, not changes in anything someone wishes to assign it to. It seems that in addition to the term evolution being broadened to mean just about any change, it is also substituted for the word “science” at will. Notice how it was done in post #2 above. The word “evolution” was dropped, and the word “science” replaced it. What are the possibilities that evolution is “brought in as a narrative gloss” after a discovery, rather than being a cornerstone of all of biology, or all of science? CSC - Why Do We Invoke Darwin?
0	Its better then being dead.............
1	Not at all. You said
1	this is a rant. no argumentative value. its cool that he's a curator of birds though  interesting that one of the main goals of creationist scientists is to first discredit science by any means necessary. once they accomplish that in their audience, they proceed to show how they apply science to strengthen their case for creation. a very interesting approach, i must say
1	Actually, monkeys do not change into humans. The ancestor of all primates had the potential to become many different things. If a primate were to change (somehow), it probably would not become human.  By the way, such a change will not be shown within your lifetime. Aren't you aware of the thousands of years involved?
1	Like my Rabbi said, some people take the Bible a little too literally.  My Rabbi has taught me to use the Bible as a guide, not a law. God loves all his creatures regardless.  Please don't preach your Christian hate speeches to me...I am still human afterall.  Just because the majority of US Citizens claim to be Christian doesn't mean our government should throw out the secular basis for our constitution. There are other Americans who aren't Christian that still have the same rights as any other person in the US.
0	Actually, the more educated a person is, the less likely he is to be a creationist. Creationists tend to be semi-literate (poorly educated), rural, poor, and female.
0	BUT how is it not.....I have a committed realtionship, and after 4 years  ( longer than most heterosexual relationships) don't we deserve the same rights as you , even if.....you don't believe it is moral. We have given our lives to each other. How is that different from your relationship. Is yours better in some way?....NO it is not....
1	You stated that the global flood could not have happened because it is inconsistent of observable science, correct?  Therefore, you are assuming that God is constrained by observable science.  Your argument is not rational, or logical, it is insanity, although it is far better than I expected.
1	How were they able to get an "aggravated assault" charge pinned on you? I'm assuming she never had a mark on herself to show the cops. Had you two had a previous domestic call history with the police?Hopefully justice will be served when you get your day in court.Then you'll get to experience the wonder that is "family court", if you haven't already.You have my sympathies.
0	No, i was not trying to make that point. I was in a heterosexual marriage for many of the same reasons that Justine has addressed. I just have never mentioned it before in this forum.
1	It's not tough, especially for close stars. http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/CosmosNotes/distance.htm  You use triangulation based on the orbit of the earth.
